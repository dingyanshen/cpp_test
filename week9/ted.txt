I'm a meteorologist by degree

I have a bachelor's master's and PhD in physical meteorology

so I'm a meteorologist card carrying

And so with that comes four questions always

This is one prediction I will always get right

Laughter

And those questions are

Marshall what channel are you on

Laughter

Dr Shepherd what's the weather going to be tomorrow

Laughter

And oh I love this one

My daughter is getting married next September it's an outdoor wedding

Is it going to rain

Laughter

Not kidding I get those and I don't know the answer to that

the science isn't there

But the one I get a lot these days is

Dr Shepherd do you believe in climate change

Do you believe in global warming

Now I have to gather myself every time I get that question

Because it's an illposed question 

science isn't a belief system

My son he's   he believes in the tooth fairy

And he needs to get over that because I'm losing dollars fast

Laughter

But he believes in the tooth fairy

But consider this

Bank of America building there in Atlanta

You never hear anyone say

Do you believe if you go to the top of that building

and throw a ball off it's going to fall

You never hear that because gravity is a thing

So why don't we hear the question

Do you believe in gravity

But of course we hear the question

Do you believe in global warming

Well consider these facts

The American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS
AAAS
one of the leading organizations in science

queried scientists and the public on different science topics

Here are some of them

genetically modified food animal research human evolution

And look at what the scientists say about those

the people that actually study those topics in red

versus the gray what the public thinks

How did we get there

How did we get there

That scientists and the public are so far apart on these science issues

Well I'll come a little bit closer to home for me

climate change

Eightyseven percent of scientists

believe that humans are contributing to climate change

But only  percent of the public

How did we get there

So it begs the question

what shapes perceptions about science

It's an interesting question

and one that I've been thinking about quite a bit

I think that one thing that shapes perceptions in the public about science

is belief systems and biases

Belief systems and biases

Go with me for a moment

Because I want to talk about three elements of that

confirmation bias DunningKruger effect
DunningKruger
and cognitive dissonance

Now these sound like big fancy academic terms and they are

But when I describe them you're going to be like Oh

I recognize that I even know somebody that does that
 
Confirmation bias

Finding evidence that supports what we already believe

Now we're probably all a little bit guilty of that at times

Take a look at this

I'm on Twitter

And often when it snows

I'll get this tweet back to me

Laughter

Hey Dr Shepherd I have  inches of global warming in my yard

what are you guys talking about climate change

I get that tweet a lot actually

It's a cute tweet it makes me chuckle as well

But it's oh so fundamentally scientifically flawed

Because it illustrates

that the person tweeting doesn't understand

the difference between weather and climate

I often say weather is your mood

and climate is your personality

Think about that

Weather is your mood climate is your personality

Your mood today doesn't necessarily tell me anything about your personality

nor does a cold day tell me anything about climate change

or a hot day for that matter

DunningKruger

Two scholars from Cornell came up with the DunningKruger effect
DunningKruger
If you go look up the peerreviewed paper for this

you will see all kinds of fancy terminology

it's an illusory superiority complex thinking we know things

In other words people think they know more than they do

Or they underestimate what they don't know

And then there's cognitive dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is interesting

We just recently had Groundhog Day right

Now there's no better definition of cognitive dissonance

than intelligent people asking me if a rodent's forecast is accurate

Laughter

But I get that all of the time

Laughter

But I also hear about the Farmer's Almanac

We grew up on the Farmer's Almanac people are familiar with it

The problem is it's only about  percent accurate

according to studies at Penn State University

But we're in an era of science

where we actually can forecast the weather

And believe it or not and I know some of you are like Yeah right

we're about  percent accurate or more with weather forecast

You just tend to remember the occasional miss you do

Laughter

So confirmation bias DunningKruger and cognitive dissonance
DunningKruger
I think those shape biases and perceptions that people have about science

But then there's literacy and misinformation

that keep us boxed in as well

During the hurricane season of 

media outlets had to actually assign reporters

to dismiss fake information about the weather forecast

That's the era that we're in

I deal with this all the time in social media

Someone will tweet a forecast 

that's a forecast for Hurricane Irma but here's the problem

it didn't come from the Hurricane Center

But people were tweeting and sharing this it went viral
 
It didn't come from the National Hurricane Center at all

So I spent  years of my career at NASA
NASA
before coming to the University of Georgia

and I chair their Earth Science Advisory Committee

I was just up there last week in DC

And I saw some really interesting things

Here's a NASA model and science data from satellite
NASA
showing the  hurricane season

You see Hurricane Harvey there

Look at all the dust coming off of Africa

Look at the wildfires up in northwest US and in western Canada

There comes Hurricane Irma

This is fascinating to me

But admittedly I'm a weather geek

But more importantly it illustrates that we have the technology

to not only observe the weather and climate system

but predict it

There's scientific understanding

so there's no need for some of those perceptions and biases

that we've been talking about

We have knowledge

But think about this 

This is Houston Texas after Hurricane Harvey

Now I write a contribution for Forbes magazine periodically

and I wrote an article a week before Hurricane Harvey made landfall saying

There's probably going to be  to  inches of rainfall

I wrote that a week before it happened

But yet when you talk to people in Houston

people are saying We had no idea it was going to be this bad

I'm just

Sigh

Laughter

A week before

But 

I know it's amusing but the reality is

we all struggle with perceiving something outside of our experience level

People in Houston get rain all of the time

they flood all of the time

But they've never experienced that

Houston gets about  inches of rainfall for the entire year

They got  inches in three days

That's an anomaly event that's outside of the normal

So belief systems and biases literacy and misinformation

How do we step out of the boxes that are cornering our perceptions

Well we don't even have to go to Houston we can come very close to home

Laughter

Remember Snowpocalypse

Laughter

Snowmageddon

Snowzilla

Whatever you want to call it

All two inches of it

Laughter

Two inches of snow shut the city of Atlanta down

Laughter

But the reality is we were in a winter storm watch

we went to a winter weather advisory

and a lot of people perceived that as being a downgrade

Oh it's not going to be as bad

When in fact the perception was that it was not going to be as bad

but it was actually an upgrade

Things were getting worse as the models were coming in

So that's an example of how we get boxed in by our perceptions

So the question becomes

how do we expand our radius

The area of a circle is pi r squared
 r
We increase the radius we increase the area

How do we expand our radius of understanding about science

Here are my thoughts

You take inventory of your own biases

And I'm challenging you all to do that

Take an inventory of your own biases

Where do they come from

Your upbringing your political perspective your faith 

what shapes your own biases

Then evaluate your sources 

where do you get your information on science

What do you read what do you listen to

to consume your information on science

And then it's important to speak out

Talk about how you evaluated your biases and evaluated your sources

I want you to listen to this little second clip

from one of the top TV meteorologists in the US Greg Fishel
Greg Fishel
in the Raleigh Durham area

He's revered in that region

But he was a climate skeptic

But listen to what he says about speaking out

Greg Fishel The mistake I was making

and didn't realize until very recently

was that I was only looking for information

to support what I already thought

and was not interested in listening to anything contrary

And so I woke up one morning

and there was this question in my mind

Greg are you engaging in confirmation bias

Are you only looking for information to support what you already think

And if I was honest with myself and I tried to be

I admitted that was going on

And so the more I talked to scientists

and read peerreviewed literature

and tried to conduct myself the way I'd been taught to conduct myself

at Penn State when I was a student

it became very difficult for me to make the argument

that we weren't at least having some effect

Maybe there was still a doubt as to how much

but to say nothing was not a responsible thing for me to do

as a scientist or a person

JMS Greg Fishel just talked about expanding his radius
Greg Fishel
of understanding of science

And when we expand our radius

it's not about making a better future

but it's about preserving life as we know it

So as we think about expanding our own radius in understanding science

it's critical for Athens Georgia for Atlanta Georgia

for the state of Georgia and for the world

So expand your radius

Thank you

Applause

When I was in high school at the age of  

I graduated from high school in Decatur Georgia

as valedictorian of my high school 

I was very proud of myself

I was from a lowincome community I had grown up in Mississippi

we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia

so my parents could pursue their degrees as United Methodist ministers

We were poor but they didn't think we were poor enough

so they were going for permanent poverty

Laughter

And so while they studied at Emory

I studied at Avondale and I became valedictorian

Well one of the joys of being valedictorian in the state of Georgia

is that you get invited to meet the governor of Georgia

I was mildly interested in meeting him

It was kind of cool

I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion

because I watched a lot of General Hospital and Dynasty

as a child

Laughter

And so I got up that morning ready to go to visit the governor

My mom and my dad who were also invited got up

and we went outside

But we didn't get in our car

And in the south a car is a necessary thing

We don't have a lot of public transit there aren't a lot of options

But if you're lucky enough to live in a community

where you don't have a car

the only option is public transit

And that's what we had to take

And so we got on the bus

And we took the bus from Decatur all the way to Buckhead

where the Governor's Mansion sat on this really beautiful acreage of land

with these long black gates that ran the length of the property

We get to the Governor's Mansion

we pull the little lever that lets them know this is our stop

we get off the bus

my mom my dad and I we walk across the street

We walk up the driveway because there are cars coming up

cars bringing in students from all across the state of Georgia

So we're walking along the side

And as we walk single file along the side

my mom and dad sandwiching me to make sure I don't get hit by one of the cars

bringing in the other valedictorians

we approach the guard gate

When we get to the guard gate the guard comes out

He looks at me and he looks at my parents

and he says You don't belong here this is a private event

My dad says No this is my daughter Stacey She's one of the valedictorians

But the guard doesn't look at the checklist that's in his hands

He doesn't ask my mom for the invitation

that's at the bottom of her very voluminous purse

Instead he looks over our shoulder at the bus

because in his mind the bus is telling him a story about who should be there

And the fact that we were too poor to have our own car 

that was a story he told himself

And he may have seen something in my skin color

he may have seen something in my attire

I don't know what went through his mind

But his conclusion was to look at me again

and with a look of disdain say

I told you this is a private event You don't belong here

Now my parents were studying to become United Methodist ministers

but they were not pastors yet

Laughter

And so they proceeded to engage this gentleman

in a very robust discussion of his decisionmaking skills

Laughter

My father may have mentioned

that he was going to spend eternity in a very fiery place

if he didn't find my name on that checklist

And indeed the man checks the checklist eventually

and he found my name and he let us inside

But I don't remember meeting the governor of Georgia

I don't recall meeting my fellow valedictorians

from  school districts

The only clear memory I have of that day

was a man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia

looking at me and telling me I don't belong

And so I decided someodd years later

to be the person who got to open the gates

Cheers

Applause

Unfortunately you may have read the rest of the story

It didn't quite work out that way

And now I'm tasked with figuring out How do I move forward

Because you see I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women

who had been underestimated and told they don't belong

I wanted to open those gates for Latinas and for Asian Americans

I wanted to open those gates for the undocumented and the documented

I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community
LGBTQ
I wanted to open those gates

for the families that have to call themselves the victims of gun violence

I wanted to open those gates wide for everyone in Georgia

because that is our state and this is our nation

and we all belong here

Cheers

Applause

But what I recognized is that the first try wasn't enough

And my question became How do I move forward

How do I get beyond the bitterness and the sadness and the lethargy

and watching an inordinate amount of television as I eat ice cream

Laughter

What do I do next

And I'm going to do what I've always done

I'm going to move forward because going backwards isn't an option

and standing still is not enough

Applause

You see I began my race for governor

by analyzing who I was and what I wanted to be

And there are three questions I ask myself about everything I do

whether it's running for office or starting a business

when I decided to start the New Georgia Project

to register people to vote

or when I started the latest action Fair Fight Georgia

No matter what I do I ask myself three questions

What do I want

Why do I want it

And how do I get it

And in this case I know what I want

I want change

That is what I want

But the question is

What change do I want to see

And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are

One am I honest about the scope of my ambition

Because it's easy to figure out that once you didn't get what you wanted

then maybe you should have set your sights a little lower

but I'm here to tell you to be aggressive about your ambition

Do not allow setbacks to set you back

Applause

Number two let yourself understand your mistakes

But also understand their mistakes

because as women in particular

we're taught that if something doesn't work out

it's probably our fault

And usually there is something we could do better

but we've been told not to investigate too much

what the other side could have done

And this isn't partisan  it's people

We're too often told that our mistakes are ours alone

but victory is a shared benefit

And so what I tell you to do is understand your mistakes

but understand the mistakes of others

And be clearheaded about it

And be honest with yourself and honest with those who support you

But once you know what you want

understand why you want it

And even though it feels good revenge is not a good reason

Laughter

Instead make sure you want it

because there's something not that you should do

but something you must do

It has to be something that doesn't allow you to sleep at night

unless you're dreaming about it

something that wakes you up in the morning and gets you excited about it

or something that makes you so angry

you know you have to do something about it

But know why you're doing it

And know why it must be done

You've listened to women from across this world

talk about why things have to happen

But figure out what the why is for you

because jumping from the what to the do

is meaningless if you don't know why

Because when it gets hard when it gets tough

when your friends walk away from you

when your supporters forget you

when you don't win your first race 

if you don't know why you can't try again

So first know what you want

Second know why you want it

but third know how you're going to get it done

I faced a few obstacles in this race

Laughter

Just a few

But in the pursuit

I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor

in the history of the United States of America for a major party

Cheers

Applause

But more importantly in this process

we turned out  million African American voters in Georgia

That is more voters

than voted on the Democratic side of the ticket in 

Applause

Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos

who believed their voices mattered in the state of Georgia

We tripled the number of Asian Americans

who stood up and said This is our state too

Those are successes that tell me how I can get it done

But they also let me understand the obstacles aren't insurmountable

They're just a little high

But I also understand

that there are three things that always hold us hostage

The first is finances

Now you may have heard I'm in a little bit of debt

If you didn't hear about it you did not go outside

Laughter

And finances are something that holds us back so often

our dreams are bounded by how much we have in resources

But we hear again and again

the stories of those who overcome those resource challenges

But you can't overcome something you don't talk about

And that's why I didn't allow them to debtshame me in my campaign

I didn't allow anyone to tell me that my lack of opportunity

was a reason to disqualify me from running

And believe me people tried to tell me I shouldn't run

Friends told me not to run

Allies told me not to run

USA Today mentioned maybe I shouldn't run

Laughter

But no matter who it was

I understood that finances are often a reason we don't let ourselves dream

I can't say that you will always overcome those obstacles

but I will tell you you will be damned if you do not try

The second is fear

And fear is real

It is paralyzing

It is terrifying

But it can also be energizing

because once you know what you're afraid of

you can figure out how to get around it

And the third is fatigue

Sometimes you just get tired of trying

You get tired of reading about processes and politics

and the things that stop you from getting where you want to be

Sometimes fatigue means that we accept position instead of power

We let someone give us a title as a consolation prize

rather than realizing we know what we want and we're going to get it

even if we're tired

That's why God created naps

Laughter

But we also learn in those moments

that fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much we want it

Because if you are beaten down

if you have worked as hard as you can

if you have done everything you said you should

and it still doesn't work out

fatigue can sap you of your energy

But that's why you go back to the why of it

Because I know we have to have women who speak for the voiceless

I know we have to have people of good conscience

who stand up against oppression

I know we have to have people

who understand that social justice belongs to us all

And that wakes me up every morning

and that makes me fight even harder

Because I am moving forward knowing what is in my past

I know the obstacles they have for me

I know what they're going to do

and I'm fairly certain they're energizing and creating new obstacles now

But they've got four years to figure it out

Laughter

Applause

Maybe two

Cheers

Applause

But here's my point

I know what I want and that is justice

I know why I want it

because poverty is immoral and it is a stain on our nation

And I know how I'm going to get it

by moving forward every single day

Thank you so much

Cheers

Applause

I want to start by telling you two things about myself

before I get into the full talk

And the first is that I've been writing about manners and civility

for more than  years

as a book author and as a magazine columnist

The second is

my friends know to be very wary of inviting me over for dinner

because any faux pas that happens at the table

is likely to wind up in print

Laughter

So I'm watching I can see back there and I can see through the portals too

Laughter

So speaking of dinner parties

I want to take you back to  and a dinner party that I went to

To place this in time

this was when Caitlyn Jenner was first coming out

shedding her identity as a Kardashian

and moving into her life as a transgender activist

I wrote a column in People magazine at the time

talking about the importance of names

and how names are our identity

And that to misuse them or not to use them erases us in a certain way

And especially with Caitlyn Jenner

I talked about Caitlyn but also the use of her pronouns

Her pronouns

So I'm at this dinner  delicious wonderful fun 

when my host goes on a rant about Caitlyn Jenner

And she is saying that it is disrespectful for Caitlyn Jenner

to force her to use a new name and to use these new pronouns

She's not buying it

and I'm listening and because I do meditation

I took my sacred pause before I responded

Laughter

And I reminded her that when she got married

she changed her name

and that she took the name of her husband

And that's the name all of us now use

We don't use it just because it's her legal name

but we use it because it's respectful

Ditto for Miss Jenner

She didn't buy it and we didn't speak for years

Laughter

So 

I am known as the Civilist

And it's probably a word that you're not that familiar with

It's not in common parlance

and it comes from the Latin and the French

and it means an individual who tries to live by a moral code

who is striving to be a good citizen

The word civility is derived from that

and the original definition of civility

is citizens willing to give of themselves for the good of the city

for the good of the commonwealth for the larger good

So in this talk

you're going to learn three new ways to be civil I hope

and it will be according to the original definition of civility

My first problem is

civility is an obsolete word

My second problem is

civility has become a dirty word in this country

And that is whether you lean right or whether you lean left

And in part that's because modern usage equates civility with decorum

with formal politeness formal behavior

We've gotten away from the idea of citizenship

So let me start by talking a little bit about my friends on the right

who have conflated civility with what they call political correctness

And to them callouts for civility

are really very much like what George Orwell wrote in  

he called it newspeak

And this was an attempt to change the way we talk

by forcibly changing the language that we use

To change our ideas by changing the meaning of words

And I think my dinner host might have had some of that

rattling around there

And I first personally understood though

the right's problem with civility

when I wrote a column about thencandidate Donald Trump
Donald Trump
And he had just said

he did not have time for total political correctness

and he did not believe the country did either

And I took that to heart it was very 

The audience was very engaged about that online as you can imagine

There was a thousand responses and this one stood out to me

because it was representative

Political correctness is a pathological system

that lets liberals dominate a conversation

label demonize and shout down the opposition

So I think to the right civility translates into censure

So that's the right

Now my friends on the left also have a problem with it

And for example there have been those

who have harassed Trump administration officials

who support the President's border wall

They've been called out as rude they've been called out as nasty

they've been called out as worse

And after one such incident last year

even the Washington Post 

you know leftleaning Washington Post 

wrote an editorial and sided with decorum

And they argued that officials should be allowed to dine in peace

Hm

You know the wall is the real incivility here

The teargassing of kids the separation of families

That's what the protestors say

And imagine if we had sided in this country

with decorum and courtesy throughout our history

You know I think about the suffragettes

They marched they picketed

They were chastised they were arrested

for pursuing the vote for women in the s

You know I also think about the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr

the father of American nonviolent civil disobedience

He was labeled as uncivil in his attempt to promote racial and economic justice

So I think you get a sense

of why civility has become a problem a dirty word here

Now does this mean we can't disagree that we can't speak our minds

Absolutely not

I recently spoke with Dr Carolyn Lukensmeyer
Carolyn Lukensmeyer
She's kind of the guru of civility in this country

and the executive director of a body

called the National Institute for Civil Discourse

And she told me

Civility does not mean appeasement or avoiding important differences

It means listening and talking about those differences with respect

In a healthy democracy we need to do that

And I call that respectful engagement

But civil discourse also needs rules it needs boundaries

For instance there's a difference

between language that is simply rude or demeaning

and speech that invokes hatred and intolerance

And specifically of groups

And I'm thinking of racial and ethnic groups

I'm thinking of the LGBTQ community
LGBTQ
I'm thinking of the disabled

We snowflakes call this speech hate speech

And hate speech can lead to violence

So to that point in the fall of 

I wrote a column about Dr Christine Blasey Ford
Christine Blasey Ford
You may remember her

she was one of the women who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh

of sexual assault

And among the responses

I received this message a personal message

which you can see here on the slide

It's been largely redacted

Laughter

This message was  words long  of them were the fbomb
f
And the Democrats were called out President Obama was called out

and I was referred to in a pretty darn vulgar and coarse way

There was an explicit threat in that message

and that is why my editors at The Post sent it to authorities

This came shortly before the pipe bombs were sent to other media outlets

so everybody was really kind of on guard there

And the larger context was only a few months before

five staffers had been killed at a Maryland newspaper

They had been shot dead by a reader with a grudge

Shut up or else

And it was around that same time

that a different reader of mine started stalking me online

And at first it was 

I'll call it light and fluffy

It was around this time last year

and I still had my Christmas decorations up

and he sent me a message saying

You should take your Christmas decorations down

And then he noticed that my dog was off leash one day

and then he commented that I had gone to the market

And then he wrote me one that said

If anyone were to shoot and kill you

it would not be a loss at all

I wish that were the end of the story

Because then a few months later he came to my door my front door

in a rage and tried to break the door down

I now own mace a security system

and a Louisville Slugger baseball bat

Sighs

Shut up or else

So what's to be done

to forestall civility from turning ugly from turning violent

My first rule is to deescalate language

And I've stopped using trigger words in print

And by trigger words I mean homophobe I mean racist

I mean xenophobe I mean sexist

All of those words

They set people off

They're incendiary

and they do not allow us to find common ground

They do not allow us to find a common heart

And so to this point when John McCain died in 
John McCain
his supporters noted that he never made personal attacks

But his opponents agreed as well

and I though that was what was really noteworthy

He challenged people's policies he challenged their positions

but he never made it personal

And so that's the second rule

So the problem of civility is not only an American one

In the Netherlands there are calls for a civility offensive right now

and as one Dutch philosopher has put it

the country has fallen under a spell of verhuftering

Now this is not a word that I knew before and I did quite a bit of research

It loosely means bullying and the disappearance of good manners

It actually means much worse than that but that's what I'm saying here

When you have a specific word though to describe a problem like that

you know you really have a problem

And in the United Kingdom the [] Brexit vote 

you know has divided a nation even more so

And one critic of the breakup called those who favor it 

I just love this phrase 

the frightened parochial lizard brain of Britain

The frightened parochial lizard brain of Britain

That's personal

And it makes me miss Downton Abbey

and its patina of civility

But therein lies the third rule

don't mistake decorum for civility

Even if you have a dowager countess as fabulous as Dame Maggie Smith

Laughter

[Don't be defeatist It's so middle class]
[]
So let me end with one last story

Not that long ago I was at a bakery and they make these amazing scones

So long line  there are a lot of scones

And one by one the scones were disappearing

until there was one woman in between me and that last scone

Laughter

Praise the Lord she said I'll have a croissant

Laughter

So when it became my turn I said I'll take that scone

The guy behind me 

I'd never turned around never seen him 

he shouted That's my scone

I've been waiting in line  minutes

And I was like Who are you

I've been waiting in line  minutes and you're behind me

So I grew up here in New York

and went to high school not that far from here

And I may seem you know very civil here and so on

but I can hip check anybody for a taxicab in this room on these streets

So I was surprised when I said to this guy 

Would you like half

Would you like half

I didn't think about it it just came out

And then he was very puzzled and I could see his face change

and he said to me

Well how about if I buy another pastry and we'll share both of them

And he did and we did

And we sat and talked

We had nothing in common

Laughter

We had nothing in common nationality sexual orientation occupation

But through this moment of kindness through this moment of connection

we developed a friendship we have stayed in touch

Laughter

Although he was appalled to learn that I'm called the Civilist after that

Laughter

But I call this the joy of civility

The joy of civility

And it led me to wonder

what is the good we forgo not just the trouble we avoid

when we choose to be uncivil

And by good I mean friendship I mean connection

I mean sharing  calories

But I also mean it in a larger way

You know as communities and as a country and as a world

What are we missing out on

So today we are engaged in a great civil war of ideas and identity

And we have no rules for them

You know there are rules for war

Think about the Geneva Conventions

They ensure that every soldier is treated humanely

on and off the battlefield

So frankly I think we need a Geneva Convention of civility

to set the rules for discourse for the parameters of that

To help us become better citizens of our communities and of our countries

And if I have anything to say about it

I would base those rules on the original definition of civility

from the Latin and from the French

Civility

citizens willing to give of themselves for the greater good

For the good of the city

So I think civility with that understanding is not a dirty word

And I hope the civilist will not become or will not stay obsolete

Thank you

Applause

HR jargon makes me crazy

We have to have all these stupid acronyms

that describe things that nobody understands OKRs and PIPs
OKRPIP
I think we can run our businesses

by just talking to each other like regular human beings

We might actually get more done

[The Way We Work]
[]
I really always wanted to be an HR professional

I wanted to be able to speak the language of management

And you know what I've learned after all this time

I don't think any of it matters

There's all kinds of things that we call best practices

that aren't best practices at all

How do we know it's best We don't measure this stuff
 
In fact I've learned that best practices usually means

copying what everybody else does

Our world is changing and evolving all the time

Here are some lessons to help you adapt

Lesson one Your employees are adults

You know we've created so many layers

and so many processes and so many guidelines

to keep those employees in place

that we've ended up with systems that treat people like they're children

And they're not

Fully formed adults walk in the door every single day

They have rent payments they have obligations

they're members of society

they want to create a difference in the world

So if we start with the assumption

that everybody comes to work to do an amazing job

you'd be surprised what you get

Lesson two The job of management isn't to control people

it's to build great teams

When managers build great teams here's how you know it

They've done amazing stuff

Customers are really happy

Those are the metrics that really matter

Not the metrics of Do you come to work on time

Did you take your vacation Did you follow the rules
 
Did you ask for permission

Lesson three People want to do work that means something

After they do it they should be free to move on

Careers are journeys

Nobody's going to want to do the same thing for  years

So the idea of keeping people for the sake of keeping them

really hurts both of us

Instead what if we created companies that were great places to be from

And everyone who leaves you

becomes an ambassador for not only your product

but who you are and how you operate

And when you spread that kind of excitement throughout the world

then we make all of our companies better

Lesson four Everyone in your company should understand the business

Now based on the assumption that we've got smart adults here

the most important thing we can teach them is how our business works

When I look at companies that are moving fast

that are really innovative

and that are doing amazing things with agility and speed

it's because they're collaborative

The best thing that we can do is constantly teach each other what we do

what matters to us what we measure what goodness looks like

so that we can all drive towards achieving the same thing

Lesson five Everyone in your company should be able to handle the truth

You know why people say giving feedback is so hard

They don't practice

Let's take the annual performance review

What else do you do in your whole life that you're really good at

that you only do once a year

Here's what I found

humans can hear anything if it's true

So let's rethink the word feedback

and think about it as telling people the truth the honest truth

about what they're doing right and what they're doing wrong

in the moment when they're doing it

That good thing you just did whoo

That's exactly what I'm talking about

Go do that again

And people will do that again today three more times

Lesson six Your company needs to live out its values

I was talking to a company not long ago to the CEO

He was having trouble because the company was rocky

and things weren't getting done on time

and he felt like things were sloppy

This also was a man who I observed

never showed up to any meeting on time

Ever

If you're part of a leadership team

the most important thing that you can do to uphold your values is to live them

People can't be what they can't see

We say Yes we're here for equality

and then we proudly pound our chest

because we'd achieved  percent representation of women

on an executive team

Well that's not equal that's  percent

Lesson seven All startup ideas are stupid

I spend a lot of time with startups

and I have a lot of friends that work in larger more established companies

They are always poohpoohing the companies that I work with

That is such a stupid idea

Well guess what all startup ideas are stupid

If they were reasonable somebody else would have already been doing them

Lesson eight Every company needs to be excited for change

Beware of the smoke of nostalgia

If you find yourself saying Remember the way it used to be

I want you to shift your thinking to say

Think about the way it's going to be

If I had a dream company

I would walk in the door and I would say

Everything's changed all bets are off

We were running as fast as we can to the right

and now we'll take a hard left

And everybody would go Yes

It's a pretty exciting world out there and it's changing all the time

The more we embrace it and get excited about it

the more fun we're going to have

Is it just me

or are there other people here

that are a little bit disappointed with democracy

Applause

So let's look at a few numbers

If we look across the world

the median turnout in presidential elections

over the last  years

has been just  percent

Now if we go to Europe

and we look at people that participated in EU parliamentary elections

the median turnout in those elections

is just  percent

Now let's go to New York

and let's see how many people voted in the last election for mayor

We will find that only  percent of people showed up to vote

What that means is that if Friends was still running

Joey and maybe Phoebe would have shown up to vote

Laughter

And you cannot blame them because people are tired of politicians

And people are tired of other people using the data that they have generated

to communicate with their friends and family

to target political propaganda at them

But the thing about this is that this is not new

Nowadays people use likes to target propaganda at you

before they use your zip code or your gender or your age

because the idea of targeting people with propaganda for political purposes

is as old as politics

And the reason why that idea is there

is because democracy has a basic vulnerability

This is the idea of a representative

In principle democracy is the ability of people to exert power

But in practice we have to delegate that power to a representative

that can exert that power for us

That representative is a bottleneck

or a weak spot

It is the place that you want to target if you want to attack democracy

because you can capture democracy by either capturing that representative

or capturing the way that people choose it

So the big question is

Is this the end of history

Is this the best that we can do

or actually are there alternatives

Some people have been thinking about alternatives

and one of the ideas that is out there is the idea of direct democracy

This is the idea of bypassing politicians completely

and having people vote directly on issues

having people vote directly on bills

But this idea is naive

because there's too many things that we would need to choose

If you look at the th US Congress

you will have seen that the House of Representatives

considered more than  bills

the Senate considered more than  bills

and they approved more than  laws

Those would be many decisions

that each person would have to make a week

on topics that they know little about

So there's a big cognitive bandwidth problem

if we're going to try to think about direct democracy as a viable alternative

So some people think about the idea of liquid democracy or fluid democracy

which is the idea that you endorse your political power to someone

who can endorse it to someone else

and eventually you create a large follower network

in which at the end there's a few people that are making decisions

on behalf of all of their followers and their followers

But this idea also doesn't solve the problem of the cognitive bandwidth

and to be honest it's also quite similar to the idea of having a representative

So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to be a little bit provocative

and I'm going to ask you well

What if instead of trying to bypass politicians

we tried to automate them

The idea of automation is not new

It was started more than  years ago

when French weavers decided to automate the loom

The winner of that industrial war was JosephMarie Jacquard

He was a French weaver and merchant

that married the loom with the steam engine

to create autonomous looms

And in those autonomous looms he gained control

He could now make fabrics that were more complex and more sophisticated

than the ones they were able to do by hand

But also by winning that industrial war

he laid out what has become the blueprint of automation

The way that we automate things for the last  years

has always been the same

we first identify a need

then we create a tool to satisfy that need

like the loom in this case

and then we study how people use that tool

to automate that user

That's how we came from the mechanical loom

to the autonomous loom

and that took us a thousand years

Now it's taken us only a hundred years

to use the same script to automate the car

But the thing is that this time around

automation is kind of for real

This is a video that a colleague of mine from Toshiba shared with me

that shows the factory that manufactures solid state drives

The entire factory is a robot

There are no humans in that factory

And the robots are soon to leave the factories

and become part of our world

become part of our workforce

So what I do in my day job

is actually create tools that integrate data for entire countries

so that we can ultimately have the foundations that we need

for a future in which we need to also manage those machines

But today I'm not here to talk to you about these tools

that integrate data for countries

But I'm here to talk to you about another idea

that might help us think about how to use artificial intelligence in democracy

Because the tools that I build are designed for executive decisions

These are decisions that can be cast in some sort of term of objectivity 

public investment decisions

But there are decisions that are legislative

and these decisions that are legislative require communication among people

that have different points of view

require participation require debate

require deliberation

And for a long time we have thought that well

what we need to improve democracy is actually more communication

So all of the technologies that we have advanced in the context of democracy

whether they are newspapers or whether it is social media

have tried to provide us with more communication

But we've been down that rabbit hole

and we know that's not what's going to solve the problem

Because it's not a communication problem

it's a cognitive bandwidth problem

So if the problem is one of cognitive bandwidth

well adding more communication to people

is not going to be what's going to solve it

What we are going to need instead is to have other technologies

that help us deal with some of the communication

that we are overloaded with

Think of like a little avatar

a software agent

a digital Jiminy Cricket 
Jiminy Cricket
Laughter

that basically is able to answer things on your behalf

And if we had that technology

we would be able to offload some of the communication

and help maybe make better decisions or decisions at a larger scale

And the thing is that the idea of software agents is also not new

We already use them all the time

We use software agents

to choose the way that we're going to drive to a certain location

the music that we're going to listen to

or to get suggestions for the next books that we should read

So there is an obvious idea in the st century

that was as obvious as the idea

of putting together a steam engine with a loom at the time of Jacquard

And that idea is combining direct democracy with software agents

Imagine for a second a world

in which instead of having a representative that represents you

and millions of other people

you can have a representative that represents only you

with your nuanced political views 

that weird combination of libertarian and liberal

and maybe a little bit conservative on some issues

and maybe very progressive on others

Politicians nowadays are packages and they're full of compromises

But you might have someone that can represent only you

if you are willing to give up the idea

that that representative is a human

If that representative is a software agent

we could have a senate that has as many senators as we have citizens

And those senators are going to be able to read every bill

and they're going to be able to vote on each one of them

So there's an obvious idea that maybe we want to consider

But I understand that in this day and age

this idea might be quite scary

In fact thinking of a robot coming from the future

to help us run our governments

sounds terrifying

But we've been there before

Laughter

And actually he was quite a nice guy

So what would the Jacquard loom version of this idea look like

It would be a very simple system

Imagine a system that you log in and you create your avatar

and then you're going to start training your avatar

So you can provide your avatar with your reading habits

or connect it to your social media

or you can connect it to other data

for example by taking psychological tests

And the nice thing about this is that there's no deception

You are not providing data to communicate with your friends and family

that then gets used in a political system

You are providing data to a system that is designed to be used

to make political decisions on your behalf

Then you take that data and you choose a training algorithm

because it's an open marketplace

in which different people can submit different algorithms

to predict how you're going to vote based on the data you have provided

And the system is open so nobody controls the algorithms

there are algorithms that become more popular

and others that become less popular

Eventually you can audit the system

You can see how your avatar is working

If you like it you can leave it on autopilot

If you want to be a little more controlling

you can actually choose that they ask you

every time they're going to make a decision

or you can be anywhere in between

One of the reasons why we use democracy so little

may be because democracy has a very bad user interface

And if we improve the user interface of democracy

we might be able to use it more

Of course there's a lot of questions that you might have

Well how do you train these avatars

How do you keep the data secure

How do you keep the systems distributed and auditable

How about my grandmother who's  years old

and doesn't know how to use the internet

Trust me I've heard them all

So when you think about an idea like this you have to beware of pessimists

because they are known to have a problem for every solution

Laughter

So I want to invite you to think about the bigger ideas

The questions I just showed you are little ideas

because they are questions about how this would not work

The big ideas are ideas of

What else can you do with this

if this would happen to work

And one of those ideas is well who writes the laws

In the beginning we could have the avatars that we already have

voting on laws that are written by the senators or politicians

that we already have

But if this were to work

you could write an algorithm

that could try to write a law

that would get a certain percentage of approval

and you could reverse the process

Now you might think that this idea is ludicrous and we should not do it

but you cannot deny that it's an idea that is only possible

in a world in which direct democracy and software agents

are a viable form of participation

So how do we start the revolution

We don't start this revolution with picket fences or protests

or by demanding our current politicians to be changed into robots

That's not going to work

This is much more simple

much slower

and much more humble

We start this revolution by creating simple systems like this in grad schools

in libraries in nonprofits

And we try to figure out all of those little questions

and those little problems

that we're going to have to figure out to make this idea something viable

to make this idea something that we can trust

And as we create those systems that have a hundred people a thousand people

a hundred thousand people voting in ways that are not politically binding

we're going to develop trust in this idea

the world is going to change

and those that are as little as my daughter is right now

are going to grow up

And by the time my daughter is my age

maybe this idea that I know today is very crazy

might not be crazy to her and to her friends

And at that point

we will be at the end of our history

but they will be at the beginning of theirs

Thank you

Applause

It was a Thursday

June the rd 

Sighs

Collect your belongings You are free to go

When escorted outside go directly to your car

Do not talk to reporters

My head is spinning

my heart is racing

I can't get a breath

I just want out of there

When I get to my car

I throw everything on the back

and I just collapse into the driver's seat

I can't do this

I can't go home to my family

that I haven't seen in a week

and pretend to be happy

Not even their love and support

could help me at this particular time

We had just sentenced a man to death

Now what

Just go home and wash dishes

You see in Mississippi

the death penalty is like a part of our unspoken culture

The basic logic is if you murder someone

then you're going to receive the death penalty

So when the jury selection process took place

they asked me

Could you

if the evidence presented justified the death penalty

could you deliver

rationally and without reservations

a penalty of death

My answer was an astounding yes

and I was selected as Juror Number 

The trial started

From the evidence being presented

and from the pictures of the victim

my first response was Yes this man is a monster

and he deserves the death penalty

For days I sat and looked at his hands

the ones that yielded the knife

and against his pasty white skin

his eyes 

Well he spent endless days in his cell

no sunlight

so his eyes were as black as his hair and his mustache

He was very intimidating

and there was absolutely no doubt in his guilt

But regardless of his guilt

as the days passed

I began to see this monster

as a human being

Something inside of me was changing that I just didn't understand

I was beginning to question myself

as to whether or not I wanted to give this man the death penalty

Jury deliberations began

and the judge gave us jury instructions

and it was to be used as a tool

in how to reach a verdict

Well using this tool only led to one decision

and that was the death penalty

I felt backed into a corner

My head and my heart were in conflict with each other

and the thought of the death penalty

made me sick

However following the judge's instructions

being a lawabiding person

I gave up

I gave up and voted along with the other  jurors

And there it was

our broken judicial system at work

So here I am in my car

and I'm wondering

How is my life ever going to be the same

My life was kids work church ball games 

just your average normal everyday life

Now everything felt trivial

I was going down this rabbit hole

The anger the anxiety

the guilt the depression 

it just clung to me

I knew that my life had to resume

so I sought counseling

The counselor diagnosed me with PTSD

and told me that the best way to overcome the PTSD

was to talk about the trauma

However if I talked or tried to talk about the trauma

outside her office

I was shut down

No one wanted to hear about it

He was just a murderer Get over it

It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor

Twelve years later 

I learned that Bobby Wilcher had dropped all of his appeals

and his execution date was approaching

That was like a punch in the stomach

All of those buried feelings just started coming back

To try and find peace I called Bobby's attorney and I said

Can I see Bobby before he's executed

Driving to the penitentiary on the day of his execution

in my mind

Bobby was going to be manic

But surprisingly he was very calm

And for two hours he and I sat there and talked about life

and I got to ask him to forgive me for my hand in his death

His words to me were

You don't have to apologize

You didn't put me here

I did this myself

But if it'll make you feel better

I forgive you

On my way home

I stopped by a restaurant and bought a margarita

Laughter

I don't think I could get one big enough 

Laughter

to try and calm down

My phone rang

It was Bobby's attorney

Within two minutes of his execution

they had given him a stay

This stay gave me time

to reach out to Bobby

And as crazy as it may sound

we became friends

Three months later

he was executed by the State of Mississippi

I'm here to tell you my story

because it was precisely  years later

that I even wanted to open up enough to talk about it

when a friend encouraged me

Hey perhaps you need to talk to the other jurors

You've been through the same experience

Uncertain of what I was after

I did need to talk to them

So I set out on my quest

and I actually found most of them

The first juror I met

thought that Bobby got what he deserved

Another juror 

well they just kind of regretted that it took so long

to carry the sentence out

Then one juror and I don't know what was wrong with him

but he didn't remember anything about the trial

Laughter

Well

I'm thinking in my mind

Jeez is this the response I'm gonna get from everybody else

Well thank God for Allen

Allen was a gentle soul

And when I talked to him he was genuinely upset

about our decision

And he told me about the day that the devastation

really set in on him and hit him

He was listening to the radio

and the radio had a list of names of men to be executed

at Parchman Penitentiary

He heard Bobby's name

and he then truly realized what he had done

And he said You know I had a responsibility in that man's death

Now here it is something years later

and Allen is still dealing with that issue

And he's never told anyone about it not even his wife

He also told me

that if the State of Mississippi wanted to keep the death penalty

then hey they needed to provide counseling for the jurors

Then the next juror I met was Jane

Jane is now totally against the death penalty

And there was Bill

Bill said he had this crushing depression for weeks

and when he went back to work

his colleagues would say things to him like

Hey did you fry him

To them it was just a joke

Then there was Jon

Jon said his decision weighed on him

and it burdened him daily

The final juror that I spoke to was Ken

Ken was the foreman of the jury

When we sat down to talk

it was apparent that he was deeply saddened by what we were required to do

He relived the day that he left the courthouse

and he drove home

and he went to put his key in his door and unlock it

and he said he literally broke down

He said he knew that Bobby was guilty

but the decision he made

he did not know if it was the right decision

And he said that he played it over and over in his head

Did we do the right thing

Did we do the right thing

Did we do the right thing

Sighs

All those years

and I finally realized that I was not the only disillusioned juror

And we talked about sharing our experience

with potential jurors

to give them some insight into what to expect

and to tell them do not be complacent

to know what you believe

to know where you stand and be prepared

because you don't want to walk in one morning as a juror

and leave at the end of the trial feeling like a murderer

Now through this storm in my life I did find some inspiration

and it came in the form of my granddaughters

My yearold granddaughter Maddie

was writing an essay on the death penalty for school

and she was asking me questions

Well it dawned on me that this child was being raised

in the same eyeforaneye culture

as I was

or had been

And so I explained my experience to her this way

that I had sentenced someone to death

as I served on a jury

And I asked her

Did that make me a murderer

She couldn't answer

I knew then that this topic needed to be open for discussion

And guess what happened

I got invited to speak just recently

in an abolitionist community

While I was there I got a Tshirt
T
It says Stop Executions

Well when I get home my yearold granddaughter was there Anna

and she says Can I have that shirt

Well I looked at her dad 

her dad is my son 

and I knew that he is still dealing with this death penalty issue

So I turned around and I looked at her and I said

Are you gonna wear this

So she turned and she looked at her dad and she said

Dad I know how you feel

but I don't believe in the death penalty

My son looked at me

shook his head and said

Thanks Mom

And I knew it wasn't a nice Thanks Mom

Laughter

So I learned that life had taught me some lessons

It taught me if I had not served on that jury

that I would still be of the same mindset

It also gave me confidence

to be able to see through the eyes of my granddaughters

that this younger generation they're capable and they're willing

to tackle these difficult social issues

And because of my experience

my granddaughters

they're now more equipped to stand on their own

and to think for themselves

than to rely on cultural beliefs

So

being from a conservative Christian family

from a very conservative state in the United States

I am here to tell you

that the death penalty has new opponents

Thank you

Aja Monet Our story begins like all great young love stories

Phillip Agnew She slid in my DMs 

AM He liked about  of my photos

backtoback in the middle of the night 

PA What I saw was an artist committed to truth and justice 

and she's beautiful but I digress

AM Our story actually begins across many worlds

over maqluba and red wine in Palestine

But how did we get there

PA Well I was born in Chicago

the son of a preacher and a teacher

My ears first rung with church songs sung by my mother on Saturday mornings

My father's South Side sermons summoned me

My first words were more notes than quotes

It was music that molded me

Later on it was Florida AM University that first introduced me to organizing

In  a young black male named Trayvon Martin was murdered
Trayvon Martin
and it changed my life and millions of others'

We were a ragtag group of college kids and notquite adults

who had decided enough was enough

Art and organizing became our answer to anger and anxiety

We built a movement and it traveled around the world

and to Palestine in 

AM I was born to a single mother

in the Pink House projects of Brooklyn New York

Maddened by survival

I gravitated inwards towards books poems and my brother's handmedown Walkman

I saw trainstation theater

subwoofing streets and hood murals

In high school I found a community of metaphor magicians

and truthtelling poets

in an organization called Urban Word NYC
Urban Word NYC
Adopted by the Black Arts movement

I won the legendary Nuyorican Poets Cafe Grand Slam title

Applause and cheers

At Sarah Lawrence College I worked with artists

to respond to Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake

I discovered the impact of poetry

and the ability to not just articulate our feelings

but to get us to work towards changing things

and doing something about it

when a friend Maytha Alhassen invited me to Palestine 
Maytha Alhassen
PA We were a delegation of artists and organizers

and we immersed ourselves in Palestinian culture

music their stories

Late into the night

we would have discussions about the role of art in politics

and the role of politics in art

Aja and I disagree
AJA
AM Oh we disagree

PA But we quite quickly and unsurprisingly fell in love

Exhibit A
A
me working my magic

Laughter

AM Obvious isn't it

Four months later this artist 

PA and this organizer 

AM moved into a little home with a big backyard in Miami

PA Sighs

Listen five months before this ever happened

I predicted it all

I'm going to tell you 

a friend sat me down and said

You've done so much for organizing

when are you going to settle down

I looked him straight in the face

and I said The only way that it would ever happen

is if it is a collision

This woman would have to knock me completely off course

I didn't know how right I was

Laughter

Our first few months were like any between young lovers

filled with hot passionate allnight 

AM nonstop 

PA discussions
PA
Laughter

PA Aja challenged everything I knew and understood about the world
AJA
She forced me 

AM lovingly 

PA to see our organizing work with new eyes
PA
She helped me see the unseen things

and how artists illuminate our interior worlds

AM There were many days I did not want to get up out of bed

and face the exterior world

I was discouraged

There was so much loss and death

and artists were being used to numb lull and exploit

While winning awards accolades and grants soothed so many egos

people were still dying

and I was seeking community

Meeting Phillip brought so much joy love truth into my life

and it pulled me out of isolation

He showed me that community and relationships

wasn't just about building great movements

It was integral in creating powerful meaningful art

and neither could be done in solitude

PA Yeah we realized many of our artist and organizer friends were also lost

in these cycles of sadness

and we were in movements that often found themselves at funerals

We asked ourselves

what becomes of a generation all too familiar

with the untimely ends of lives streamed daily on our Timelines

It was during one of our latenight discussions

that we saw beyond art and organizing

and began to see that art was organizing

AM The idea was set
AM
art was an anchor not an accessory to movement

Our home was a home of radical imagination

an instrument of our nurturing hearts

a place of risk where were dared to laugh love cry debate

Art books records and all this stuff decorated our walls

and there was lizards 

walls of palm trees that guided our guests into our backyard

where our neighbors would come and feel right at home

The wind 

the wind was an affirmation for the people who walked into the space

And we learned that in a world 

a bewildering world of so much distraction 

we were able to cultivate a space where people could come and be present

and artists and organizers could find refuge

PA This became Smoke Signals Studio

AM As we struggle to clothe house feed and educate our communities

our spirits hunger for connection joy and purpose

and as our bodies are out on the front lines

our souls still need to be fed

or else we succumb to despair and depression

Our art possesses rhythmic communication

coded emotional cues

improvised feelings of critical thought

Our social movements should be like jazz

encouraging active participation

listening

spontaneity and freedom

What people see as a party 

PA is actually a movement meeting
PA
See we aren't all protest and pain

Here's a place to be loved

to be felt to be heard

and where we prepare for the most pressing political issues

in our neighborhoods

See laws never change culture

but culture always changes laws

Art 

Applause

Art as organizing is even changing and opening doors

in places seen as the opposite of freedom

Our weekly poetry series

is transforming the lives of men incarcerated at Dade Correctional

and we're so excited to bring you all the published work of one of those men

Echo Martinez

In the intro he says 

AM Poetry for the people is a sick pen's penicillin

It's a cuff key to a prisoner's dreams

The Molotov in the ink

It is knowledge it is overstanding

it is tasting ingredients in everything you've been forcefed

but most of all it's a reminder that we all have voices

we all can be heard even if we have to scream

In  we created our first annual Maroon Poetry Festival

at the TACOLCY Center in Liberty City
TACOLCY
There the Last Poets Sonia Sanchez Emory Douglas

and the late great Ntozake Shange

performed and met with local artists and organizers

We were able to honor them

for their commitment to radical truthtelling

And in addition to that

we transformed a public park

into the physical manifestation of the world we are organizing for

Everything that we put into poetry

we put into the art into the creativity

into the curated kids' games

and into the stunning stage design

PA Our work is in a long line of cultural organizers

that understood to use art to animate a radical future

Artists like June Jordan

Emory Douglas

and Nina Simone

They understood what many of us are just now realizing 

that to get people to build the ship

you've got to get them to long for the sea

that data rarely moves people but great art always does

This understanding 

Applause

This understanding informed the thinking

behind the Dream Defenders' Freedom Papers

a radical political vision for the future of Florida

that talked about people over profits

Now we could have done a policy paper

Instead artists and organizers came together in their poetry

to create incredible murals

and did the video that we see behind us

We joined the political precision of the Black Panther Party

and the beautiful poetry of Puerto Rican poet Martn Espada

to bring our political vision to life

AM Now thousands of Floridians across age race gender and class
AM
see the Freedom Papers as a vision for the future of their lives

For decades our artists and our art has been used to exploit

lull numb

sell things to us

and to displace our communities

but we believe that the personal is political

and the heart is measured by what is done

not what one feels

And so art as organizing is not just concerned with artists' intentions

but their actual impact

Great art is not a monologue

Great art is a dialogue between the artist and the people

PA Four years ago this artist 

AM and this organizer 
AM
PA found that we were not just a match
PA
AM We were a mirror

PA Our worlds truly did collide

and in many ways 

AM they combined

PA We learned so much about movement

about love and about art at its most impactful

when it articulates the impossible and when it erodes individualism

when it plays into the gray places of our black and white worlds

when it does what our democracy does not

when it reminds us that we are not islands

when it adorns every street but Wall Street and Madison Avenue

when it reminds us that we are not islands

and refuses to succumb to the numbness

when it indicts empire

and inspires each and every one of us to love

tell the truth

and make revolution irresistible

AM For the wizards 

Applause

AM For the wizards and ways of our defiance

loveriot visions of our rising risen raised selves

The overcoming grace 

fires bitter tongues

wise as rickety rocking chairs

suffering salt and sand skies

Memories unshackled and shining stitches

on a stretchmarked heart

For the flowers that bloom in midnight scars

How we suffered and sought a North Star

When there was no light we glowed

We sparked this rejoice

this righteous delight

We have a cause to take joy in

How we weathered and persisted

tenacious

no stone unturned

How we witnessed the horror of mankind

and did not become that which horrified us

PA Thank you

AM Thank you

When my yearold mother Elia moved in with me

I thought I was doing her a service

In fact it was the other way around

You see Mom was having issues with memory loss and accepting her age

She looked defeated

I tried to make her as comfortable as possible

but when I was at my easel painting

I would peek over and see her just  there

She'd be staring at nothing in particular

I'd watch her slowly climb the stairs

and she wasn't the mom I grew up with

I saw instead a frail

tiny old woman

A few weeks went by and I needed a break from my painting

I wanted to play with the new camera I had just bought

I was excited  it had all sorts of dials

buttons and settings I wanted to learn

so I set up my tripod facing this large mirror

blocking the doorway to the only bathroom in the house

Laughter

After a while I hear

Imitating Italian accent I need to use the washroom

Laughter

Five minutes Mom I need to do this

 minutes later and I hear again

I need to use the washroom

Five more minutes

Then this happened

Laughter

Applause

And this

Laughter

And then this

Laughter

I had my aha moment
 
We connected

We had something tangible we could do together

My mom was born in a small mountain village in central Italy

where her parents had land and sheep

At a young age her father died of pneumonia

leaving his wife and two daughters alone with all the heavy chores

They found that they couldn't cope

So a very hard decision was made

Mom the oldest at 

was married off to a complete stranger twice her age

She went from being just a kid and was pushed into adulthood

Mom had her first child when she was only 

Years later and now living in Toronto

Mom got work in a clothing factory

and soon became manager of a very large sewing department

And because it was full of immigrant workers

Mom taught herself words from translation books

She then practiced them in French Greek Spanish Portuguese Danish

Polish Russian Romanian Hungarian all around the house

I was in awe of her focus and determination to succeed

at whatever she loved to do

After that bathroom aha moment
 
I practiced my newfound camera skills with Mom as portrait model

Through all of this she talked and I listened

She'd tell me about her early childhood and how she was feeling now

We had each other's attention

Mom was losing her shortterm memory

but was better recalling her younger years

I'd ask and she would tell me stories

I listened and I was her audience

I got ideas

I wrote them down and I sketched them out

I showed her what to do by acting out the scenarios myself

We would then stage them

So she posed and I learned more about photography

Mom loved the process the acting

She felt worthy again she felt wanted and needed

And she certainly wasn't camerashy

Laughter

Applause

Mom laughed hysterically at this one

Laughter

The idea for this image came from an old German film I'd seen

about a submarine called Das Boot
Das Boot
As you can see what I got instead looked more like ET
ET
Laughter

So I put this image aside thinking it was a total failure

because it didn't reach my particular vision

But Mom laughed so hard

I eventually for fun decided to post it online anyway

It got an incredible amount of attention

Now with any Alzheimer's dementia

there's a certain amount of frustration and sadness

for everyone involved

This is Mom's silent scream

Her words to me one day were

Why is my head so full of things to say

but before they reach my mouth I forget what they are

Why is my head so full of things to say

but before they reach my mouth I forget what they are

Applause

Now as fulltime care partner and fulltime painter

I had my frustrations too

Laughter

But to balance off all the difficulties we played

That was Mom's happy place

And I needed her to be there too

Laughter

Laughter

Laughter

Now Mom was also preoccupied with aging

She would say How did I get so old so fast

Audience sighs

So old

So fast

I also got Mom to model for my oil paintings

This painting is called The Dressmaker
Dressmaker
I remember as a kid

Mom sewing clothes for the whole family

on this massive heavy sewing machine

that was bolted to the floor in the basement

Many nights I would go downstairs and bring my schoolwork with me

I would sit behind her in this overstuffed chair

The low hum of the huge motor and the repetitive stitching sounds

were comforting to me

When Mom moved into my house

I saved this machine and stored it in my studio for safekeeping

This painting brought me back to my childhood

The interesting part

was that it was now Mom sitting behind me

watching me paint her

working on that very same machine she sewed at

when I sat behind her watching her sew

 years earlier

I also gave Mom a project to do to keep her busy and thinking

I provided her with a small camera

and asked her to take at least  pictures a day of anything she wanted

These are Mom's photographs

She's never held a camera in her life before this

She was 

We would sit down together and talk about our work

I would try to explain

Laughter

how and why I did them

the meaning the feeling why they were relevant

Mom on the other hand would just bluntly say

s

no

bella or bruta

Laughter

I watched her facial expressions

She always had the last say with words or without

This voyage of discovery hasn't ended with Mom

She is now in an assisted living residence

a minute walk away from my home

I visit her every other day

Her dementia had gotten to the point

where it was unsafe for her to be in my house

It has a lot of stairs

She doesn't know my name anymore

Voice breaking But you know what That's OK
 
She still recognizes my face

and always has a big smile when she sees me

Applause

Applause ends

I don't take pictures of her anymore

That wouldn't be fair or ethical on my part

And she wouldn't understand the reasons for doing them

My father

my brother

Voice breaking my nephew

my partner and my best friend

all passed away suddenly

And I didn't have the chance

to tell them how much I appreciated and loved them

With Mom I need to be there

and make it a very long goodbye

Applause

Applause ends

For me it's about being present and really listening

Dependents want to feel a part of something anything

It doesn't need to be something exceptionally profound that's shared 

it could be as simple as walks together

Give them a voice

of interaction participation

and a feeling of belonging

Make the time meaningful

Life it's about wanting to live

and not waiting to die

Applause

Applause ends

Can I get a wave and a smile from everyone please

Laughter

This is for you Mom

So the first antidepressants were made from of all things

rocket fuel left over after World War II

Which is fitting seeing as today one in five soldiers develop depression

or posttraumatic stress disorder or both

But it's not just soldiers that are at high risk for these diseases

It's firefighters ER doctors cancer patients aid workers refugees 

anyone exposed to trauma or major life stress

And yet despite how commonplace these disorders are

our current treatments if they work at all

only suppress symptoms

In  when Edward Jenner discovered the first vaccine 

it happened to be for smallpox 

he didn't just discover a prophylactic for a disease

but a whole new way of thinking

that medicine could prevent disease

However for over  years

this prevention was not believed to extend to psychiatric diseases

Until  when my colleague and I accidentally discovered

the first drugs that might prevent depression and PTSD

We discovered the drugs in mice

and we're currently studying whether they work in humans

And these preventative psychopharmaceuticals

are not antidepressants

They are a whole new class of drug

And they work by increasing stress resilience

so let's call them resilience enhancers

So think back to a stressful time that you've since recovered from

Maybe a breakup or an exam you missed a flight

Stress resilience is the active biological process

that allows us to bounce back after stress

Similar to if you have a cold and your immune system fights it off

And insufficient resilience

in the face of a significant enough stressor

can result in a psychiatric disorder such as depression

In fact most cases of major depressive disorder

are initially triggered by stress

And from what we've seen so far in mice

resilience enhancers can protect against purely biological stressors

like stress hormones

and social and psychological stressors like bullying and isolation

So here is an example where we gave mice

three weeks of high levels of stress hormones

So in other words a biological stressor without a psychological component

And this causes depressive behavior

And if we give three weeks of antidepressant treatment beforehand

it has no beneficial effects

But a single dose of a resilience enhancer given a week before

completely prevents the depressive behavior

Even after three weeks of stress

This is the first time a drug has ever been shown

to prevent the negative effects of stress

Depression and PTSD are chronic often lifelong clinical diseases
PTSD
They also increase the risk of substance abuse homelessness

heart disease Alzheimer's suicide

The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year

But now imagine a scenario where we know someone is predictively

at high risk for exposure to extreme stress

Say a red cross volunteer going into an earthquake zone

In addition to the typhoid vaccine

we could give her a pill or an injection of a resilience enhancer

before she leaves

So when she is held at gunpoint by looters or worse

she would at least be protected against developing depression or PTSD

after the fact

It won't prevent her from experiencing the stress

but it will allow her to recover from it

And that's what's revolutionary here

By increasing resiliency

we can dramatically reduce her susceptibility to depression and PTSD

possibly saving her from losing her job her home her family or even her life

After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine

a lot of other vaccines rapidly followed

But it was over  years

before a tuberculosis vaccine was widely available

Why

In part because society believed

that tuberculosis made people more sensitive and creative and empathetic

And that it was caused by constitution and not biology

And similar things are still said today about depression

And just as Jenner's discovery opened the door

for all of the vaccines that followed after

the drugs we've discovered open the possibility of a whole new field

preventative psychopharmacology

But whether that's  years away

or  years away

depends not just on the science

but on what we as a society choose to do with it

Thank you

To do two things at once is to do neither

It's a great smackdown of multitasking isn't it

often attributed to the Roman writer Publilius Syrus

although you know how these things are he probably never said it

What I'm interested in though is  is it true

I mean it's obviously true for emailing at the dinner table

or texting while driving or possibly for live tweeting at TED Talk as well
TED
But I'd like to argue that for an important kind of activity

doing two things at once  or three or even four 

is exactly what we should be aiming for

Look no further than Albert Einstein

In  he published four remarkable scientific papers

One of them was on Brownian motion

it provided empirical evidence that atoms exist

and it laid out the basic mathematics behind most of financial economics

Another one was on the theory of special relativity

Another one was on the photoelectric effect

that's why solar panels work it's a nice one

Gave him the Nobel prize for that one

And the fourth introduced an equation you might have heard of

E equals mc squared
Emc
So tell me again how you shouldn't do several things at once

Now obviously working simultaneously

on Brownian motion special relativity and the photoelectric effect 

it's not exactly the same kind of multitasking

as Snapchatting while you're watching Westworld
Snapchat
Very different

And Einstein yeah well Einstein's  he's Einstein

he's one of a kind he's unique

But the pattern of behavior that Einstein was demonstrating

that's not unique at all

It's very common among highly creative people

both artists and scientists

and I'd like to give it a name

slowmotion multitasking

Slowmotion multitasking feels like a counterintuitive idea

What I'm describing here

is having multiple projects on the go at the same time

and you move backwards and forwards between topics as the mood takes you

or as the situation demands

But the reason it seems counterintuitive

is because we're used to lapsing into multitasking out of desperation

We're in a hurry we want to do everything at once

If we were willing to slow multitasking down

we might find that it works quite brilliantly

Sixty years ago a young psychologist by the name of Bernice Eiduson

began a long research project

into the personalities and the working habits

of  leading scientists

Einstein was already dead

but four of her subjects won Nobel prizes

including Linus Pauling and Richard Feynman

The research went on for decades

in fact it continued even after professor Eiduson herself had died

And one of the questions that it answered

was How is it that some scientists are able to go on producing important work

right through their lives

What is it about these people

Is it their personality is it their skill set

their daily routines what

Well a pattern that emerged was clear and I think to some people surprising

The top scientists kept changing the subject

They would shift topics repeatedly

during their first  published research papers

Do you want to guess how often

Three times

Five times

No On average the most enduringly creative scientists

switched topics  times in their first  research papers

Seems that the secret to creativity is multitasking

in slow motion

Eiduson's research suggests we need to reclaim multitasking

and remind ourselves how powerful it can be

And she's not the only person to have found this

Different researchers

using different methods to study different highly creative people

have found that very often they have multiple projects in progress

at the same time

and they're also far more likely than most of us to have serious hobbies

Slowmotion multitasking among creative people is ubiquitous

So why

I think there are three reasons

And the first is the simplest

Creativity often comes when you take an idea from its original context

and you move it somewhere else

It's easier to think outside the box

if you spend your time clambering from one box into another

For an example of this consider the original eureka moment

Archimedes  he's wrestling with a difficult problem

And he realizes in a flash

he can solve it using the displacement of water

And if you believe the story

this idea comes to him as he's taking a bath

lowering himself in and he's watching the water level rise and fall

And if solving a problem while having a bath isn't multitasking

I don't know what is

The second reason that multitasking can work

is that learning to do one thing well

can often help you do something else

Any athlete can tell you about the benefits of crosstraining

It's possible to crosstrain your mind too

A few years ago researchers took  randomly chosen medical students

and they enrolled them in a course at the Philadelphia Museum of Art

where they learned to criticize and analyze works of visual art

And at the end of the course

these students were compared with a control group

of their fellow medical students

And the ones who had taken the art course

had become substantially better at performing tasks

such as diagnosing diseases of the eye by analyzing photographs

They'd become better eye doctors

So if we want to become better at what we do

maybe we should spend some time doing something else

even if the two fields appear to be as completely distinct

as ophthalmology and the history of art

And if you'd like an example of this

should we go for a less intimidating example than Einstein OK
 
Michael Crichton creator of Jurassic Park and ER

So in the s he originally trained as a doctor

but then he wrote novels

and he directed the original Westworld movie

But also and this is less wellknown

he also wrote nonfiction books

about art about medicine about computer programming

So in  he enjoyed the fruits of all this variety

by penning the world's most commercially successful book

And the world's most commercially successful TV series

And the world's most commercially successful movie

In  he did it all over again

There's a third reason

why slowmotion multitasking can help us solve problems

It can provide assistance when we're stuck

This can't happen in an instant

So imagine that feeling of working on a crossword puzzle

and you can't figure out the answer

and the reason you can't is because the wrong answer is stuck in your head

It's very easy  just go and do something else

You know switch topics switch context

you'll forget the wrong answer

and that gives the right answer space to pop into the front of your mind

But on the slower timescale that interests me

being stuck is a much more serious thing

You get turned down for funding

Your cell cultures won't grow your rockets keep crashing

Nobody wants to publish you fantasy novel about a school for wizards

Or maybe you just can't find the solution to the problem that you're working on

And being stuck like that means stasis stress

possibly even depression

But if you have another exciting challenging project to work on

being stuck on one is just an opportunity to do something else

We could all get stuck sometimes even Albert Einstein

Ten years after the original miraculous year that I described

Einstein was putting together the pieces of his theory of general relativity

his greatest achievement

And he was exhausted

And so he turned to an easier problem

He proposed the stimulated emission of radiation

Which as you may know is the S in laser
S
So he's laying down the theoretical foundation for the laser beam

and then while he's doing that

he moves back to general relativity and he's refreshed

He sees what the theory implies 

that the universe isn't static

It's expanding

It's an idea so staggering

Einstein can't bring himself to believe it for years

Look if you get stuck

and you get the ball rolling on laser beams

you're in pretty good shape

Laughter

So that's the case for slowmotion multitasking

And I'm not promising that it's going to turn you into Einstein

I'm not even promising it's going to turn you into Michael Crichton

But it is a powerful way to organize our creative lives

But there's a problem

How do we stop all of these projects becoming completely overwhelming

How do we keep all these ideas straight in our minds

Well here's a simple solution a practical solution

from the great American choreographer Twyla Tharp
TwylaThirl
Over the last few decades

she's blurred boundaries mixed genres won prizes

danced to the music of everybody from Philip Glass to Billy Joel

She's written three books

I mean she's a slowmotion multitasker of course she is

She says You have to be all things

Why exclude

You have to be everything

And Tharp's method

for preventing all of these different projects from becoming overwhelming

is a simple one

She gives each project a big cardboard box

writes the name of the project on the side of the box

And into it she tosses DVDs and books magazine cuttings
DVD
theater programs physical objects

really anything that's provided a source of creative inspiration

And she writes

The box means I never have to worry about forgetting

One of the biggest fears for a creative person

is that some brilliant idea will get lost

because you didn't write it down and put it in a safe place

I don't worry about that

Because I know where to find it

It's all in the box

You can manage many ideas like this

either in physical boxes or in their digital equivalents

So I would like to urge you

to embrace the art of slowmotion multitasking

Not because you're in a hurry

but because you're in no hurry at all

And I want to give you one final example

my favorite example

Charles Darwin

A man whose slowburning multitasking is so staggering

I need a diagram to explain it all to you

We know what Darwin was doing at different times

because the creativity researchers Howard Gruber and Sara Davis

have analyzed his diaries and his notebooks

So when he left school age of 

he was initially interested in two fields

zoology and geology

Pretty soon he signed up to be the onboard naturalist on the Beagle
Beagle
This is the ship that eventually took five years

to sail all the way around the southern oceans of the Earth

stopping at the Galpagos passing through the Indian ocean

While he was on the Beagle he began researching coral reefs

This is a great synergy between his two interests

in zoology and geology

and it starts to get him thinking about slow processes

But when he gets back from the voyage

his interests start to expand even further psychology botany

for the rest of his life

he's moving backwards and forwards between these different fields

He never quite abandons any of them

In  he begins work on two very interesting projects

One of them earthworms

The other a little notebook which he titles

The transmutation of species

Then Darwin starts studying my field economics

He reads a book by the economist Thomas Malthus

And he has his eureka moment

In a flash he realizes how species could emerge and evolve slowly

through this process of the survival of the fittest

It all comes to him he writes it all down

every single important element of the theory of evolution

in that notebook

But then a new project

His son William is born

Well there's a natural experiment right there

you get to observe the development of a human infant

So immediately Darwin starts making notes

Now of course he's still working on the theory of evolution

and the development of the human infant

But during all of this

he realizes he doesn't really know enough about taxonomy

So he starts studying that

And in the end he spends eight years becoming the world's leading expert

on barnacles

Then Natural Selection

A book that he's to continue working on for his entire life he never finishes it

Origin of Species is finally published

 years after Darwin set out all the basic elements

Then the Descent of Man controversial book

And then the book about the development of the human infant

The one that was inspired when he could see his son William

crawling on the sitting room floor in front of him

When the book was published William was  years old

And all this time

Darwin's working on earthworms

He fills his billiard room with earthworms in pots with glass covers

He shines lights on them to see if they'll respond

He holds a hot poker next to them to see if they move away

He chews tobacco and 

Blows

He blows on the earthworms to see if they have a sense of smell

He even plays the bassoon at the earthworms

I like to think of this great man

when he's tired he's stressed

he's anxious about the reception of his book The Descent of Man

You or I might log into Facebook or turn on the television
Facebook
Darwin would go into the billiard room to relax

by studying the earthworms intensely

And that's why it's appropriate that one of his last great works

is the Formation of Vegetable Mould Through The Action of Worms

Laughter

He worked upon that book for  years

We don't live in the th century anymore

I don't think any of us could sit

on our creative or scientific projects for  years

But we do have something to learn from the great slowmotion multitaskers

From Einstein and Darwin to Michael Crichton and Twyla Tharp

The modern world seems to present us with a choice

If we're not going to fasttwitch from browser window to browser window

we have to live like a hermit

focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else

I think that's a false dilemma

We can make multitasking work for us

unleashing our natural creativity

We just need to slow it down

So 

Make a list of your projects

Put down your phone

Pick up a couple of cardboard boxes

And get to work

Thank you very much

Applause

Isn't it fascinating how the simple act of drawing a line on the map

can transform the way we see and experience the world

And how those spaces in between lines borders

become places

They become places where language and food and music

and people of different cultures rub up against each other

in beautiful and sometimes violent and occasionally really ridiculous ways

And those lines drawn on a map

can actually create scars in the landscape

and they can create scars in our memories

My interest in borders came about

when I was searching for an architecture of the borderlands

And I was working on several projects along the USMexico border

designing buildings made out of mud taken right from the ground

And I also work on projects that you might say immigrated to this landscape

Prada Marfa a landart sculpture
Prada Marfa
that crosses the border between art and architecture

and it demonstrated to me that architecture could communicate ideas

that are much more politically and culturally complex

that architecture could be satirical and serious at the same time

and it could speak to the disparities between wealth and poverty

and what's local and what's foreign

And so in my search for an architecture of the borderlands

I began to wonder

is the wall architecture

I began to document my thoughts and visits to the wall

by creating a series of souvenirs

to remind us of the time when we built a wall

and what a crazy idea that was

I created border games

Laughter

postcards

snow globes with little architectural models inside of them

and maps that told the story of resilience at the wall

and sought for ways that design could bring to light the problems

that the border wall was creating

So is the wall architecture

Well it certainly is a design structure

and it's designed at a research facility called FenceLab
FenceLab
where they would load vehicles with  pounds

and ram them into the wall at  miles an hour

to test the wall's impermeability

But there was also counterresearch going on on the other side

the design of portable drawbridges

that you could bring right up to the wall

and allow vehicles to drive right over

Laughter

And like with all research projects there are successes

and there are failures

Laughter

But it's these medieval reactions to the wall 

drawbridges for example 

that are because the wall itself is an arcane medieval form of architecture

It's an overly simplistic response to a complex set of issues

And a number of medieval technologies have sprung up along the wall

catapults that launch bales of marijuana over the wall

Laughter

or cannons that shoot packets of cocaine and heroin over the wall

Now during medieval times

diseased dead bodies

were sometimes catapulted over walls as an early form of biological warfare

and it's speculated that today

humans are being propelled over the wall as a form of immigration

A ridiculous idea

But the only person ever known to be documented to have launched over the wall

from Mexico to the United States

was in fact a US citizen

who was given permission to humancannonball over the wall

 feet

so long as he carried his passport in hand

Laughter

and he landed safely in a net on the other side

And my thoughts are inspired by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy

who said

Architects do not design walls

but the spaces between them

So while I do not think that architects should be designing walls

I do think it's important and urgent that they should be paying attention

to those spaces in between

They should be designing for the places and the people the landscapes

that the wall endangers

Now people are already rising to this occasion

and while the purpose of the wall is to keep people apart and away

it's actually bringing people together in some really remarkable ways

holding social events like binational yoga classes along the border

to bring people together across the divide

I call this the monument pose

Laughter

And have you ever heard of wall y ball
wall y ball
Laughter

It's a borderland version of volleyball and it's been played since 

Laughter

along the USMexico border

to celebrate binational heritage

And it raises some interesting questions right

Is such a game even legal

Does hitting a ball back and forth over the wall constitute illegal trade

Laughter

The beauty of volleyball is that it transforms the wall

into nothing more than a line in the sand

negotiated by the minds and bodies and spirits of players on both sides

And I think it's exactly these kinds of twosided negotiations

that are needed to bring down walls that divide

Now throwing the ball over the wall is one thing

but throwing rocks over the wall

has caused damage to Border Patrol vehicles

and have injured Border Patrol agents

and the response from the US side has been drastic

Border Patrol agents have fired through the wall

killing people throwing rocks on the Mexican side

And another response by Border Patrol agents

is to erect baseball backstops to protect themselves and their vehicles

And these backstops became a permanent feature

in the construction of new walls

And I began to wonder if like volleyball

maybe baseball should be a permanent feature at the border

and walls could start opening up

allowing communities to come across and play

and if they hit a home run

maybe a Border Patrol agent would pick up the ball and throw it

back over to the other side

A Border Patrol agent buys a raspado a frozen treat

from a vendor just a couple feet away

food and money is exchanged through the wall

an entirely normal event made illegal by that line drawn on a map

and a couple millimeters of steel

And this scene reminded me of a saying

If you have more than you need you should build longer tables

and not higher walls

So I created this souvenir to remember the moment that we could share

food and conversation across the divide

A swing allows one to enter and swing over to the other side

until gravity deports them back to their own country

The border and the border wall

is thought of as a sort of political theater today

so perhaps we should invite audiences to that theater

to a binational theater where people can come together

with performers musicians

Maybe the wall is nothing more than an enormous instrument

the world's largest xylophone and we could play down this wall

with weapons of mass percussion

Laughter

When I envisioned this binational library

I wanted to imagine a space where one could share

books and information and knowledge across a divide

where the wall was nothing more than a bookshelf

And perhaps the best way to illustrate the mutual relationship that we have

with Mexico and the United States

is by imagining a teetertotter

where the actions on one side had a direct consequence

on what happens on the other side

because you see the border itself

is both a symbolic and literal fulcrum for USMexico relations

and building walls between neighbors severs those relationships

You probably remember this quote Good fences make good neighbors

It's often thought of as the moral of Robert Frost's poem Mending Wall
Robert FrostMending Wall
But the poem is really about questioning the need for building walls at all

It's really a poem about mending human relationships

My favorite line is the first one

Something there is that doesn't love a wall

Because if there's one thing that's clear to me 

there are not two sides defined by a wall

This is one landscape divided

On one side it might look like this

A man is mowing his lawn while the wall is looming in his backyard

And on the other side it might look like this

The wall is the fourth wall of someone's house

But the reality is that the wall is cutting through people's lives

It is cutting through our private property

our public lands

our Native American lands our cities

a university

our neighborhoods

And I couldn't help but wonder

what it would be like if the wall cut through a house

Remember those disparities between wealth and poverty

On the right is the average size of a house in El Paso Texas

and on the left is the average size of a house in Juarez

And here the wall cuts directly through the kitchen table

And here the wall cuts through the bed in the bedroom

Because I wanted to communicate how the wall is not only dividing places

it's dividing people it's dividing families

And the unfortunate politics of the wall

is today it is dividing children from their parents

You might be familiar with this wellknown traffic sign

It was designed by graphic designer John Hood

a Native American war veteran

working for the California Department of Transportation

And he was tasked with creating a sign to warn motorists

of immigrants who were stranded alongside the highway

and who might attempt to run across the road

Hood related the plight of the immigrant today

to that of the Navajo during the Long Walk

And this is really a brilliant piece of design activism

And he was very careful

in thinking about using a little girl with pigtails for example

because he thought that's who motorists might empathize with the most

and he used the silhouette of the civil rights leader Cesar Chavez

to create the head of the father

I wanted to build upon the brilliance of this sign

to call attention to the problem of child separation at the border

and I made one very simple move

I turned the families to face each other

And in the last few weeks

I've had the opportunity to bring that sign back to the highway

to tell a story

the story of the relationships that we should be mending

and a reminder that we should be designing

a reunited states and not a divided states

Thank you

In  I was standing behind

a Sylvania blackandwhite television set

Hearing about these things happening on the set in the front

I was the guy you know

moving the rabbit ears for my dad and my sister and my mom

Move over here turn over here move this way we can't see the screen

And what they were watching

was One small step for a man one giant leap for mankind

Neil [Armstrong] and Buzz Aldrin were walking on the Moon
[]
And I was five years old in Lynchburg Virginia

a skinny black kid in a kind of somewhat racist town

And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life

And my parents you know they were educators

they'd said that you can do anything

But after that moon landing all the kids in the neighborhood

were like You're going to be an astronaut

I'm like No

I don't want a buzz cut and I don't see someone who looks like me

Because representation does matter

And I knew that there was a guy

five blocks down the street on Pierce Street

who was training to play tennis

And it was Arthur Ashe

And my dad talked about his character his discipline

his intelligence his athleticism

I wanted to be Arthur Ashe

I didn't want to be one of those moon guys

And as I went on through this journey

my dad who was a school teacher he played in a band

he did all these things to make money for my sister and I

to take piano lessons

and do these different things with education

And he one day decides to drive up into the driveway with this bread truck

And I'm thinking OK bread truck

me delivering bread while my dad's driving the truck

I'm like OK I'm going to be a bread guy now

But he says This is our camper

I'm like Dude come one I can read 'Merita Bread and Rolls'

on the side of this truck

And he says No we're going to build this into our camper

And over that summer we rewired the entire electrical system

We plumbed a propane tank to a Coleman stove

we built bunk beds that flip down

We were turning this into our summer vacation launch pad escape pod

this thing that could take us out of Lynchburg

And before that

I was actually raped at five by some neighbors

And I didn't tell anyone

because I had friends that didn't have fathers

And I knew that my father

would have killed the people that did that to his son

And I didn't want my father to be gone

So as we got in this bread truck and escaped from Lynchburg

it was my time with my dad

And we went to the Smoky Mountains

and looked at the purple mountains' majesty

And we walked along the beach in Myrtle Beach
Myrtle
and this thing was transformative

It showed me what it meant to be an explorer at a very early age

And I suppressed all that negativity

all that trauma

because I was learning to be an explorer

And a little bit later my mother gave me an ageinappropriate

nonOSHAcertified chemistry set
OSHA
Laughter

where I created the most incredible explosion in her living room

Laughter

And so I knew I could be a chemist

So as I went on this journey through a high school

and I went to college

and I got a football scholarship to play football in college

And I knew that I could be a chemist because I'd already blown stuff up

Laughter

And when I graduated

I got drafted to the Detroit Lions

But I pulled a hamstring in training camp

and so what every former NFL player does they go work for NASA right
NFLNASA
So I went to work for NASA
NASA
Laughter

And this friend of mine said Leland you'd be great astronaut

I just laughed at him I was like Yeah me an astronaut

You know that Neil and Buzz thing from back in '

And he handed me an application and I looked at it

and I didn't fill it out

And that same year another friend of mine filled out the application

and he got in

And I said to myself

If NASA's letting knuckleheads like that be astronauts
NASA
Laughter

maybe I can be one too

So the next selection I filled out the application and I got in

And I didn't know what it meant to be an astronaut

the training the simulations

all these things to get you ready for this countdown

three two one liftoff

And in  I was in Space Shuttle Atlantis careening off the planet

traveling at  miles per hour

And eight and a half minutes later

the main engines cut off and we're now floating in space

And I push off and float over to the window

and I can see the Caribbean

And I need new definitions of blue to describe the colors that I see

Azure indigo navy blue medium navy blue turquoise

don't do any justice to what I see with my eyes

And my job on this mission was to install

this twobillion dollar Columbus laboratory

It was a research laboratory

for materials research for human research

And I reached into the payload bay of the space shuttle

grabbed out this big module

and I used the robotic arm and I attached it to the space station

And the European team have been waiting  years for this thing to get installed

so I'm sure everyone in Europe was like Leland Leland Leland
  
Laughter

And so this moment happened this was our primary mission objective

it was done

And I had this big sigh of relief

But then Peggy Whitson the first female commander

she invited us over to the Russian segment

And the space station's about the size of a football field

with solar panel and trusses and all of these modules

And she says Leland you go get the rehydrated vegetables

we have the meat

So we float over with the bag of vegetables all rehydrated

and we get there

And there's this moment

where I get [transported] back to my mother's kitchen

You can smell the beef and barley heating up

you can smell the food the colors

and there are people there from all around the world

It's like a Benetton commercial

you know you have African American Asian American French German Russian

the first female commander

breaking bread at  miles per hour

going around the planet every  minutes

seeing a sunrise and a sunset every 

And Peggy would say Hey Leland try some of this

and she'd float it over to my mouth

and I'd catch it and we'd go back and forth

And we're doing all of this while listening to Sade's Smooth Operator
Sade
Laughter

I mean this is like blowing my mind you know

Laughter

And I float over to the window and I look down at the planet

and I see all of humanity

And my perspective changes at that moment

because I'm flying over Lynchburg Virginia my home town

and my family's probably breaking bread

And five minutes later we're flying over Paris

where Leo Eyharts is looking down at his parents
Leo Eyharts
probably having some wine and cheese

and Yuri's looking off to Moscow

and they're probably eating borscht or something else

But we're all having this moment where we see our respective families

working together as one civilization

at  miles per hour

My perspective shifted cognitively

it changed me

And when I think about being that little skinny boy

from sometimes racist Lynchburg Virginia

I would never have had that perspective

to think about myself of being an astronaut

if my father hadn't taken us on a journey

in this radical craft that we built with our own two hands

When I came home

I realized that perspective is something

that we all get and we all have

It's just how far do we open up our blinders

to see that shift and that change

And going back to the space station

I think of you know Germans and Russians fighting Americans

We have these people living and working together

White folks black folks Russian folks French folks you know

All these different people coexisting in harmony as one race

And I think about the colors that I saw the design of the modules

the way that things fit together

the way that it made us a community our home

And so when I look up to space now

and I have this newfound perspective

on the space station going overhead and looking there

and then looking back at my community

and seeing the people that I'm living and working with

and coexisting with

I think it's something that we all can do now especially in these times

to make sure that we have the right perspective

Thank you

Applause

Chee Pearlman If you don't mind could I just chat with you for a minute

because they're going to set up some things here

And I get to have you all to myself OK

Leland Melvin Alright

CP You guys don't get to hear this
CP
So I have to tell you

that in my family we watch a lot of space movies

about astronauts and stuff like that

I can't tell you why but we do

Laughter

The thing that I wanted to ask you though

is that we were seeing this movie the other day

and it was about one of the astronauts one of your colleagues

and before he went up into space

they actually wrote an obituary NASA wrote an obituary for him
NASA
And I was like is that normal

And is that part of the job

Do you think about that peril that you're putting yourself in

as you go into space

LM Yeah

So I don't remember anyone writing my obituary

maybe that was an Apolloday thing

But I do know that in the  shuttle flights that we've had

the shuttle that I flew on

we had two accidents that killed everyone on that mission

And we all know the perils and the risks that go along with this

but we're doing something that's much bigger than ourselves

and helping advance civilization

so the risk is worth the reward

And we all feel that way when we get into that vehicle

ans strap into those million pounds of rocket fuel and go up to space

CP Yeah I've only seen the Hollywood version 
CP
it looks pretty terrifying I have to tell you

LM You should go

Laughter

CP Yeah my husband's told me that a few times
CP
Laughter

LM Oneway trip or twoway
M
Laughter

CP Thats a bit of a debate in our house
CP
Laughter

I wanted to if I may 

You did touch on something that was very powerful and difficult

which is you spoke about this incident

that had happened to you when you were five years old

and that you were raped

And I just think that for you to be able to say those things

you know on the TED stage
TED
to be able to talk about that at all

is pretty fearless

And I wanted to get a sense from you

is that something that you think is important for you to share that now

to speak about it

LM It's so important especially for men to talk about things that have happened

because we've been trained

and told by our society that we have to be so tough and so hard

and we can't tell of things that are happening to us

But I've had so many men contact me and tell me that

You came through that you got over that

I'm going to get over my alcoholism

and these things that are going on in them

because of what happened to them

And so we must share these stories this is part of storytelling

to heal us and to make us whole as a community

CP That's wonderful
CP
Applause

And you know quite honestly you spoke about perspective shift

and that is a shift that I think we've been very slow to accept

and to be able to speak about that so we thank you for that

We thank you for being the amazing astronaut that you are

and thank you for coming to the TED stage Leland

LM Thank you so much Chee

The world is awash with divisive arguments

conflict

fake news

victimhood

exploitation prejudice bigotry blame shouting

and minuscule attention spans

It can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides

be stuck in echo chambers

and never agree again

It can sometimes seem like a race to the bottom

where everyone is calling out somebody else's privilege

and vying to show that they are the most harddoneby person

in the conversation

How can we make sense

in a world that doesn't

I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours

a tool that you might not expect

abstract mathematics

I am a pure mathematician

Traditionally pure maths is like the theory of maths

where applied maths is applied to real problems like building bridges

and flying planes

and controlling traffic flow

But I'm going to talk about a way that pure maths applies directly

to our daily lives

as a way of thinking

I don't solve quadratic equations to help me with my daily life

but I do use mathematical thinking to help me understand arguments

and to empathize with other people

And so pure maths helps me with the entire human world

But before I talk about the entire human world

I need to talk about something that you might think of

as irrelevant schools maths

factors of numbers

We're going to start by thinking about the factors of 

Now if this makes you shudder with bad memories of school maths lessons

I sympathize because I found school maths lessons boring too

But I'm pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction

that is very different from what happened at school

So what are the factors of 

Well they're the numbers that go into 

Maybe you can remember them We'll work them out

It's one two three

five six

  and 

It's not very interesting

It's a bunch of numbers in a straight line

We can make it more interesting

by thinking about which of these numbers are also factors of each other

and drawing a picture a bit like a family tree

to show those relationships

So  is going to be at the top like a kind of greatgrandparent

Six  and  go into 

Five goes into  and 

Two goes into six and 

Three goes into six and 

And one goes into two three and five

So now we see that  is not divisible by three

but that this is the corners of a cube

which is I think a bit more interesting

than a bunch of numbers in a straight line

We can see something more here There's a hierarchy going on

At the bottom level is the number one

then there's the numbers two three and five

and nothing goes into those except one and themselves

You might remember this means they're prime

At the next level up we have six  and 

and each of those is a product of two prime factors

So six is two times three

 is two times five

 is three times five

And then at the top we have 

which is a product of three prime numbers 

two times three times five

So I could redraw this diagram using those numbers instead

We see that we've got two three and five at the top

we have pairs of numbers at the next level

and we have single elements at the next level

and then the empty set at the bottom

And each of those arrows shows losing one of your numbers in the set

Now maybe it can be clear

that it doesn't really matter what those numbers are

In fact it doesn't matter what they are

So we could replace them with something like A B and C instead
abC
and we get the same picture

So now this has become very abstract

The numbers have turned into letters

But there is a point to this abstraction

which is that it now suddenly becomes very widely applicable

because A B and C could be anything
abC
For example they could be three types of privilege

rich white and male

So then at the next level we have rich white people

Here we have rich male people

Here we have white male people

Then we have rich white and male

And finally people with none of those types of privilege

And I'm going to put back in the rest of the adjectives for emphasis

So here we have rich white nonmale people

to remind us that there are nonbinary people we need to include

Here we have rich nonwhite male people

Here we have nonrich white male people

rich nonwhite nonmale

nonrich white nonmale

and nonrich nonwhite male

And at the bottom with the least privilege

nonrich nonwhite nonmale people

We have gone from a diagram of factors of 

to a diagram of interaction of different types of privilege

And there are many things we can learn from this diagram I think

The first is that each arrow represents a direct loss of one type of privilege

Sometimes people mistakenly think that white privilege means

all white people are better off than all nonwhite people

Some people point at superrich black sports stars and say

See They're really rich White privilege doesn't exist
 
But that's not what the theory of white privilege says

It says that if that superrich sports star had all the same characteristics

but they were also white

we would expect them to be better off in society

There is something else we can understand from this diagram

if we look along a row

If we look along the secondtotop row where people have two types of privilege

we might be able to see that they're not all particularly equal

For example rich white women are probably much better off in society

than poor white men

and rich black men are probably somewhere in between

So it's really more skewed like this

and the same on the bottom level

But we can actually take it further

and look at the interactions between those two middle levels

Because rich nonwhite nonmen might well be better off in society

than poor white men

Think about some extreme examples like Michelle Obama

Oprah Winfrey

They're definitely better off than poor white unemployed homeless men

So actually the diagram is more skewed like this

And that tension exists

between the layers of privilege in the diagram

and the absolute privilege that people experience in society

And this has helped me to understand why some poor white men

are so angry in society at the moment

Because they are considered to be high up in this cuboid of privilege

but in terms of absolute privilege they don't actually feel the effect of it

And I believe that understanding the root of that anger

is much more productive than just being angry at them in return

Seeing these abstract structures can also help us switch contexts

and see that different people are at the top in different contexts

In our original diagram

rich white men were at the top

but if we restricted our attention to nonmen

we would see that they are here

and now the rich white nonmen are at the top

So we could move to a whole context of women

and our three types of privilege could now be rich white and cisgendered

Remember that cisgendered means that your gender identity does match

the gender you were assigned at birth

So now we see that rich white cis women occupy the analogous situation
cis
that rich white men did in broader society

And this has helped me understand why there is so much anger

towards rich white women

especially in some parts of the feminist movement at the moment

because perhaps they're prone to seeing themselves as underprivileged

relative to white men

and they forget how overprivileged they are relative to nonwhite women

We can all use these abstract structures to help us pivot between situations

in which we are more privileged and less privileged

We are all more privileged than somebody

and less privileged than somebody else

For example I know and I feel that as an Asian person

I am less privileged than white people

because of white privilege

But I also understand

that I am probably among the most privileged of nonwhite people

and this helps me pivot between those two contexts

And in terms of wealth

I don't think I'm super rich

I'm not as rich as the kind of people who don't have to work

But I am doing fine

and that's a much better situation to be in

than people who are really struggling

maybe are unemployed or working at minimum wage

I perform these pivots in my head

to help me understand experiences from other people's points of view

which brings me to this possibly surprising conclusion

that abstract mathematics is highly relevant to our daily lives

and can even help us to understand and empathize with other people

My wish is that everybody would try to understand other people more

and work with them together

rather than competing with them

and trying to show that they're wrong

And I believe that abstract mathematical thinking

can help us achieve that

Thank you

So I'm a climate scientist

and if this room is representative of the country we live in

that means about  percent of you so maybe from about there over

don't strongly trust me for information on the causes of climate change

Now I promise to tell the truth tonight

but just to humor that demographic

I've started this talk with a falsehood

[The Paris Climate Accord is a product of the recognition
[]
that climate change is a global problem ]

This statement was not made by President Obama

It was made by President Reagan

and it wasn't about climate change and the Paris Climate Accord

It was actually about the Montreal Protocol

and stratospheric ozone depletion

Now I'm sure that many of you aren't familiar with this environmental problem

but you should be

because it's a rare environmental success story

And it's worth revisiting

because sometimes we need to examine the world we've avoided

in order to find guidance for the choices we make today

So let's go back to the s

when some questionable choices were made

first of all  hoo  hairstyles Laughs
 
Second of all objectively terrible quantities of hairspray

and third CFCs chlorofluorocarbons

manmade chemicals that were used as propellant in aerosol spray cans

And see it turns out these CFCs were a problem

because they were destroying the ozone layer

Now I'm sure most of you have heard of the ozone layer

but why does it matter

Well quite simply the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen

and it's really fragile

If you could take all of the ozone

which is mostly about  to  miles up above our heads

and compress it down to the surface of the earth

it would form a thin shell only about two pennies thick

about an eighth of an inch

And that thin shell does an amazing amount of work though

It filters out more than  percent of the harmful UV radiation

coming from the sun

And while I'm sure many of you enjoy that suntan that you get

from the remaining  percent it causes a lot of problems

cataracts

damage to crops

damage to immune systems

and also skin cancer

It's not an exaggeration

to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety

And actually ironically it was human safety

that motivated the invention of CFCs in the first place
CFCs
You see in the early days of refrigeration

refrigerators used toxic and flammable chemicals

like propane and ammonia

For good reason the refrigeration industry

wanted a safe alternative

and they found that in 

when a scientist named Thomas Midgley

synthesized the first commercially viable CFCs
CFCs
And in fact Midgley famously inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle
MidgleyCFCs
to demonstrate at a scientific conference

that they were safe and nonflammable

And in fact as a scientist I can tell you there is no way

you could get away with that kind of antic today

I mean wow

But really at the time

CFCs were a really remarkable invention
CFCs
They allowed what we now know as modernday refrigeration

and airconditioning and other things

So it wasn't actually until over  years later in the s

when scientists realized that CFCs would break down high in the atmosphere
CFCs
and damage the ozone layer

And this finding really set off a lot of public concern

It led ultimately to the banning of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans
CFC
in the US and a few other countries in 

Now the story doesn't end there

because CFCs were used in much more than just spray cans

In  scientists discovered the Antarctic ozone hole

and this was a truly alarming discovery

Scientists did not expect this at all

Before the Antarctic ozone hole

scientists expected maybe a five or  percent reduction

in ozone over a century

But what they found over the course of less than a decade

was that more than a third of the ozone had simply vanished

over an area larger than the size of the US

And although we now know that CFCs are the root cause of this ozone hole

at the time the science was far from settled

Yet despite this uncertainty

the crisis helped spur nations to act

So that quote that I started this talk with

about the Montreal Protocol from President Reagan 

that was his signing statement when he signed the Montreal Protocol

after its unanimous ratification by the US Senate

And this is something that's truly worth celebrating

In fact yesterday was the th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol

Applause

Because of the protocol

ozonedepleting substances are now declining in our atmosphere

and we're starting to see the first signs of healing in the ozone layer

And furthermore because many of those ozonedepleting substances

are also very potent greenhouse gases

the Montreal Protocol has actually delayed global warming

by more than a decade

That's just wonderful

But I think it's worth asking the question

as we face our current environmental crisis global warming

what lessons can we learn from Montreal

Are there any I think there are
 
First we don't need absolute certainty to act

When Montreal was signed

we were less certain then of the risks from CFCs
CFCs
than we are now of the risks from greenhouse gas emissions

A common tactic that people who oppose climate action use

is to completely ignore risk and focus only on uncertainty

But so what about uncertainty

We make decisions in the face of uncertainty all the time

literally all the time

You know I'll bet those of you who drove here tonight

you probably wore your seat belt

And so ask yourself

did you wear your seat belt because someone told you

with a hundred percent [certainty]

that you would get in a car crash on the way here

Probably not

So that's the first lesson

Risk management and decision making always have uncertainty

Ignoring risk and focusing only on uncertainty is a distraction

In other words inaction is an action

Second it takes a village to raise a healthy environment

The Montreal Protocol wasn't just put together by industry and governments

or environmental advocacy groups and scientists

It was put together by all of them

They all had a seat at the table

and they all played an important role in the solution

And I think in this regard

we're actually seeing some encouraging signs today

We see not just environmental groups concerned about climate change

but also civic and religious groups

the military and businesses

So wherever you find yourself on that spectrum

we need you at the table

because if we're going to solve global warming

it's going to take actions at all levels

from the individual to the international

and everything in between

Third lesson

don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good

While Montreal has become the brake pedal for stopping ozone depletion

at its beginning it was more just like a tap on the brakes

It was actually the later amendments to the protocol

that really marked the decision to hit the brakes on ozone depletion

So to those who despair

that the Paris Climate Accord didn't go far enough

or that your limited actions on their own won't solve global warming

I say don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good

And finally I think it helps us to contemplate the world we've avoided

Indeed the world we have avoided by enacting the Montreal Protocol

is one of catastrophic changes

to our environment and to human wellbeing

By the s we'll be avoiding millions of new skin cancer cases per year

with a number that would only grow

If I'm lucky I'll live long enough to see the end of this animation

and to see the ozone hole restored to its natural state

So as we write the story for earth's climate future

for this century and beyond

we need to ask ourselves what will our actions be

so that someone can stand on this stage

in  or  or a hundred years

to celebrate the world that they've avoided

Thank you

This is an elementary school in Columbus Ohio

And inside of this school there was a student named D
D
When D started school here he was six years old
D
cute as a button

with a smile that brightened the entire room

But after a few months in school

D became angry
D
and that smile faded

D began to do things like flip tables
D
throw desks and chairs

yell at teachers

stand in windowsills

run in and out of the classroom

and even running out of the school

Sometimes these fits of anger would put the entire school into lockdown mode

until D could get himself back together
D
which could sometimes take over an hour

No one in the school knew how to help D
D
I know this because I was the principal at this school

And what I quickly and collectively learned with my staff

was that this situation was more extreme

than anything we had ever been trained for

Every time that D lashed out
D
I kept thinking to myself

what did I miss during my principal prep coursework

What am I supposed to do with a kid like D
D
And how am I going to stop him from impeding the learning

of all the other students

And yet after we did everything that we thought we knew

such as talking to D
D
and taking away privileges

and parent phone calls home

the only real option we had left to do was to kick him out

and I knew that would not help him

This scenario is not unique to D
D
Students all over the world are struggling with their education

And though we didn't come up with a failsafe solution

we did come up with a simple idea

that in order for kids like D to not only survive in school
D
but to thrive

we somehow had to figure out a way

to not only teach them how to read and write

but also how to help them deal with and manage their own emotions

And in doing that we were able to move our school

from one of the lowestperforming schools in the state of Ohio

with an F rating
F
all the way up to a C in just a matter of a few years
C
So it might sound obvious right

Of course teachers should be focused on the emotional wellbeing of their kids

But in reality

when you're in a classroom full of  students

and one of them's throwing tables at you

it's far easier to exclude that child

than to figure out what's going on inside of his head

But what we learned about D
D
and for kids like D
D
was that small changes can make huge differences

and it's possible to start right now

You don't need bigger budgets or grand strategic plans

you simply need smarter ways of thinking about what you have

and where you have it

In education we tend to always look outside the box for answers

and we rarely spend enough time money and effort

developing what we already have inside the box

And this is how meaningful change can happen fast

So here's what I learned about D
D
I was wanting to dig a little bit deeper to figure out how he had become so angry

And what I learned was his father had left the home

and his mother was working long shifts in order to support the family

which left no adult for D to connect with 
D
and he was in charge of taking care of his younger brother

when he got home from school

Might I remind you that D was six years old
D
Can't say that I blame him for having some trouble

transitioning into the school environment

But yet we had to figure out a way to help him with these big emotions

all while teaching him core skills of reading and math

And three things helped us most

First we had to figure out where he was struggling the most

And like most young kids

arrival at school can be a tough transition time

as they're moving from a less structured home environment

to a more structured school environment

So what we did for D was we created a calming area for him
D
in our timeout room

which we had equipped with rocking chairs and soft cushions and books

and we allowed D to go to this place in the morning
D
away from the other kids

allowing him time to transition back into the school environment

on his own terms

And as we began to learn more about D
D
we learned other strategies that helped him calm down

For example D loved to help younger students

so we made him a kindergarten helper

and he went into the kindergarten classroom

and taught students how to write their letters

And he was actually successful with a few of them

that the teacher was unable to reach

And believe it or not

D actually helped calm some of those kindergarten students down

signalling to us that the influence of peers on behavior was far greater

than anything we adults could ever do

We used humor and song with him

Yes I know it sounds really silly

that the principal and the teachers would actually laugh with kids

but you can imagine the shock on D's face
D
when the principal's cracking a joke or singing a song from the radio station

which almost always ended in a laugh

shortening the length of his outburst

and helping us to connect with him in his world

So I know some you are like

It's really not practical to lay on this kind of special treatment

for every student

but we actually made it happen

Because once we figured out the tools and tactics that worked for D
D
our teachers were able to roll that out and use them with other students

We began to proactively address student behavior

instead of simply react to it

Our teachers actually took time during the lesson plan

to teach kids how to identify their feelings

and appropriate healthy coping strategies for dealing with them

such as counting to 

grabbing a fidget spinner

or taking a quick walk

We incorporated brain breaks throughout the day

allowing kids to sing songs

do yoga poses

and participate in structured physical activities

And for those kids that struggle with sitting for long periods of time

we invested in flexible seating

such as rocking chairs and exercise bikes

and even floor elliptical machines

allowing kids to pedal underneath their desks

These changes encouraged kids to stay in the classroom

helping them to focus and learn

And when less kids are disrupting

all kids do better

And here's the magical thing

it didn't cost us a whole lot of extra money

We simply thought differently about what we had

For example every public school has an instructional supply line

An instructional supply could be a book

it could be a whiteboard

it could be flexible seating

it could be a fidget spinner

it could even be painting the walls of a school a more calming color

allowing students to thrive

It's not that we didn't invest in the academic tools 

obviously 

but we took the social tools seriously too

And the results speak for themselves

By taking the emotional development of our kids seriously

and helping them manage their emotions

we saw huge growth in our reading and math scores

far exceeding the one year of expected growth

and outscoring many schools with our same demographic

The second thing we did to help our kids manage their emotions

was we used leverage

As a notsofunded public school

we didn't have the support staff

to address the chaos that our kids might be facing at home

and we certainly weren't trained or funded to address it directly

So we started to reach out to local groups

community agencies

and even the Ohio State University

Our partnership with the Ohio State University

afforded us college students

not only studying education

but also school psychology and school social work

These students were paired with our teachers

to help our most struggling students

And everyone benefitted

because our teachers got access to the latest collegelevel thinking

and those college students got realworld life experiences

in the classroom

Our partnership with our local Nationwide Children's Hospital

afforded us  they're building us a health clinic within our school

providing health and mental health resources for our students

And our kids benefitted from this too

Our absences continued to go down

and our kids had access to counseling

that they could access during the school day

And perhaps the biggest change was not in D or in the kids at all
D
It was in the adults in the room

Teachers are typically good

at planning for and delivering academic instruction

but when you throw in disruptive behavior

it can feel completely outside the scope of the job

But by us taking the emotional development of our kids seriously

we moved from a philosophy of exclusion 

you disrupt get out 

to one of trust and respect

It wasn't easy

but we felt at heart

it was a positive way to make change

and I'm in awe at the teachers that took that leap with me

As part of our personal professional development plan

we studied the research of Dr Bruce Perry

and his research on the effects of different childhood experiences

on the developing child's brain

And what we learned was that some of our students' experiences

such as an absent parent

chaotic home life

poverty and illness

create real trauma on developing brains

Yes trauma

I know it's a very strong word

but it helped us to reframe and understand the behaviors that we were seeing

And those difficult home experiences

created real barbedwire barriers to learning

and we had to figure out a way over it

So our teachers continued to practice with lesson plans

doing shorter lesson plans with a single focus

allowing kids to engage

and continued to incorporate these movement breaks

allowing kids to jump up and down in class and dance for two minutes straight

because we learned that taking breaks helps the learner retain new information

And might I add that the ChaCha Slide provides a perfect short dance party

Laughter

I saw teachers say What happened to you

instead of What's wrong with you

or How can I help you instead of Get out
 
And this investment in our kids made huge differences

and we continue to see rises in our academic scores

I'm happy to say that when D got to fourth grade
D
he rarely got into trouble

He became a leader in the school

and this behavior became contagious with other students

We saw and felt our school climate continue to improve

making it a happy and safe place not only for children

but for adults

despite any outside influence

Fastforward to today

I now work with an alternative education program

with high school students

who struggle to function in traditional high school setting

I recently reviewed some of their histories

Many of them are  to  years old

experimenting with drugs

in and out of the juvenile detention system

and expelled from school

And what I discovered was that many of them exhibit the same behaviors

that I saw in sixyearold D
D
So I can't help but wonder

if these kids would've learned healthy coping strategies early on

when times get tough

would they now be able to survive in a regular high school

I can't say for sure

but I have to tell you I believe that it would've helped

And it's time for all of us to take the social and emotional development

of our kids seriously

The time is now for us to step up and say what we need to do for our kids

If we teach kids how to read and write and they graduate

but yet they don't know how to manage emotions

what will our communities look like

I tell people

you can invest now or you will pay later

The time is now for us to invest in our kids

They're our future citizens

not just numbers that can or cannot pass a test

Thank you

Applause and cheers

My mother called this summer to stage an intervention

She'd come across a few snippets of my memoir

which wasn't even out yet

and she was concerned

It wasn't the sex

Laughter

It was the language that disturbed her

For example

I have been so many things

along my curious journey

a poor boy a nigger

a Yale man a Harvard man

a faggot a Christian

a crack baby alleged

the spawn of Satan the Second Coming

Casey

That's just page six

Laughter

So you may understand my mother's worry

But she wanted only to make one small change

So she called and she began

Hey you are a man

You're not a faggot you're not a punk

and let me tell you the difference

You are prominent You are intelligent

You dress well You know how to speak

People like you

You don't walk around doing your hand like a punk

You're not a vagabond on the street

You are an upstanding person

who just happens to be gay

Don't put yourself over there

when you are over here

She thought she'd done me a favor

and in a way she had

Her call clarified what I am trying to do with my life

and in my work as a writer

which is to send one simple message

the way we're taught to live has got to change

I learned this the hard way

I was born not on the wrong side of the tracks

but on the wrong side of a whole river

the Trinity down in Oak Cliff Texas

I was raised there in part by my grandmother

who worked as a domestic

and by my sister

who adopted me a few years after our mother

who struggled with mental illness

disappeared

And it was that disappearance

that began when I was  and lasted for five years

that shaped the person I became

the person I later had to unbecome

Before she left my mother had been my human hiding place

She was the only other person who seemed as strange as me

beautifully strange

some mix of Blanche DuBois from A Streetcar Named Desire

and a s Whitney Houston

Laughter

I'm not saying she was perfect

just that I sure benefited from her imperfections

And maybe that's what magic is after all

a useful mistake

So when she began to disappear for days at a time

I turned to some magic of my own

It struck me as from above

that I could conjure up my mother just by walking perfectly

from my elementary school at the top of a steep hill

all the way down to my grandmother's house

placing one foot and one foot only in each sidewalk square

I couldn't let any part of any foot touch the line between the square

I couldn't skip a square

all the way to the last square at the last blade of grass

that separated our lawn from our driveway

And I bullshit you not it worked 

just once though

But if my perfect walk could not bring my mother back

I found that this approach had other uses

I found that everyone else in charge around me

loved nothing more than perfection

obedience submission

Or at least if I submitted they wouldn't bother me too much

So I took a bargain

that I'd later see in a prison a Stasi prison in Berlin

on a sign that read

He who adapts can live tolerably

It was a bargain that helped ensure

I had a place to stay and food to eat

a bargain that won me praise of teachers and kin strangers

a bargain that paid off big time it seemed

when one day at  a man from Yale showed up at my high school to recruit me

for Yale's football team

It felt as out of the blue to me then as it may to you now

The Yale man said  everybody said 

that this was the best thing that could ever happen to me

the best thing that could happen to the whole community

Take this ticket boy they told me

I was not so sure

Yale seemed another world entire

a cold foreign hostile place

On the first day of my recruiting visit

I texted my sister an excuse for not going

These people are so weird

She replied You'll fit right in

Laughter

I took the ticket

and worked damn hard to fit right in

When my freshman advisor warned me not to wear my fitted hats on campus 

You're at Yale now You don't have to do that anymore she said

I figured this was just one of the small prices

that must be paid to make it

I paid them all or tried

and sure enough they seemed to pay me back

made me a leader on the varsity football team

got me into a notsosecret society

and a job on Wall Street and later in Washington

Things were going so well that I figured naturally

I should be President of the United States

Laughter

But since I was only 

and since even presidents have to start somewhere

I settled instead on a run for Congress

Now this was in the afterglow of that great  election

the election during which a serious moderate senator stressed

The message you've got to send more than any other message

is that Barack Obama is just like us
  
They sent that message so well

that their campaign became the gold standard of modern politics

if not modern life which also seems to demand

that we each do whatever it takes to be able to say at the end of our days

with peace and satisfaction I was just like everybody else

And this would be my message too

So one night I made one final call to my prospective campaign manager

We'd do the things it'd take to win but first he had one question

Is there anything I need to know

I held the phone and finally said

Well you should probably know I'm gay

Silence

Hmm I see he nearly whispered

as if he'd found a shiny penny or a dead baby bird

Laughter

I'm glad you told me he continued

You definitely didn't make my job any easier

I mean you are in Texas

But it's not impossible not impossible

But Casey let me ask you something

How are you going to feel when somebody say at a rally calls you a faggot

And let's be real OK

You do understand that somebody might want to physically harm you

I just want to know

Are you really ready for this

I wasn't

And I could not understand 

could hardly breathe

or think or say a word

But to be clear the boy that I was at that time

would have leapt at the chance to be harmed

to sacrifice everything even life for a cause

There was something shocking though 

not that there should have been but there was 

in the notion that he might be harmed for nothing more than being himself

which he had not even tried to do in the first place

All that he  all that I 

had tried to do and be was what I thought was asked of me

I was prominent for a yearold

intelligent I spoke well dressed decent I was an upstanding citizen
 
But the bargain I had accepted could not save me after all

nor can it save you

You may have already learned this lesson

or you will regardless of your sexuality

The queer receives a concentrated dose no doubt

but repression is a bitter pill that's offered to us all

We're taught to hide so many parts of who we are and what we've been through

our love our pain for some our faith

So while coming out to the world can be hard

coming in to all the raw strange magic of ourselves can be much harder

As Miles Davis said It takes a long time to sound like yourself
Miles Davis
That surely was the case for me

I had my private revelation that night at 

but mostly went on with my life

I went on to Harvard Business School started a successful nonprofit

wound up on the cover of a magazine on the stage at TED
TED
Laughter

I had achieved by my late s

about everything a kid is supposed to achieve

But I was real cracked up

not exactly having a nervous breakdown but not too far off

and awful sad either way

I had never thought of being a writer

didn't even read in earnest until I was nearly 

But the book business is about the only industry

that will pay you to investigate your own problems so 

Laughter

So I decided to give it a try

to trace those cracks with words

Now what came out on the page was about as strange as I felt at that time

which alarmed some people at first

A respected writer called to stage his own intervention

after reading a few early chapters

and he began much like my mother

Hey listen

You've been hired to write an autobiography

It's a straightforward exercise

It's got a beginning middle and end

and is grounded in the facts of your life

And by the way there's a great tradition of autobiography in this country

led by people on the margins of society who write to assert their existence

Go buy some of those books and learn from them

You're going in the wrong direction

But I no longer believed what we are taught 

that the right direction is the safe direction

I no longer believed what we are taught 

that queer lives or black lives or poor lives are marginal lives

I believed what Kendrick Lamar says on Section
 
I'm not on the outside looking in

I'm not on the inside looking out

I'm in the dead fucking center looking around

Laughter

That was the place

from which I hoped to work

headed in the only direction worth going the direction of myself

trying to help us all refuse the awful bargains

we've been taught to take

We're taught to turn ourselves

and our work into little nuggets that are easily digestible

taught to mutilate ourselves so that we make sense to others

to be a stranger to ourselves so the right people might befriend us

and the right schools might accept us and the right jobs might hire us

and the right parties might invite us

and someday the right God might invite us to the right heaven

and close his pearly gates behind us

so we can bow down to Him forever and ever

These are the rewards they say

for our obedience

to be a wellliked holy nugget

to be dead

And I say in return No thank you

To the world and to my mother

Well to tell you the truth

all I said was OK Mom I'll talk to you later

Laughter

But in my mind I said No thank you

I cannot accept her bargain either

Nor should you

It would be easy for many of us in rooms like this

to see ourselves as safe

to keep ourselves over here

We speak well we dress decent

we're intelligent people like us or act like they do

But instead I say that we should remember Lot's wife

Jesus of Nazareth said it first to his disciples

Remember Lot's wife

Lot in case you haven't read the Bible recently

was a man who set his family down in Sodom

in the midst of a wicked society that God decided he had to destroy

But God being cruel yet still a sap in part

rushed two angels out to Sodom to warn Lot to gather up his folks

and get out of Dodge

Lot heard the angel's warning but delayed

They didn't have all day to wait so they grabbed Lot's hands

and his two daughters' hands and his wife's hands

and hurried them out of Sodom

And the angels shout

Escape to the mountain Whatever you do don't look back

just as God starts raining down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah

I can't figure out how Gomorrah got dragged into this

But Lot and his folks are running

fleeing all that destruction

kicking up dust while the Lord rains down death

and then for some reason Lot's wife looks back

God turns her into a pillar of salt

Remember Lot's wife Jesus says

But I've got a question

Why does she look back

Does she look back because she didn't want to miss the mayhem

wanted one last glimpse of a city on fire

Does she look back because she wanted to be sure that her people

were far enough from danger to breathe a little easy

I'm so nosy and selfish sometimes those likely would have been my reasons

if I'd been in her shoes

But what if something else was going on with this woman Lot's wife

What if she could not bear the thought of leaving those people

all alone to burn alive

even for righteousness's sake

Isn't that possible

If it is then this backward glance of a disobedient woman

may not be a cautionary tale after all

It may be the bravest act in all the Bible

even braver than the act that holds the whole Book together

the crucifixion

We are told that up on Calvary on an old rugged cross

Jesus gave his life to save everybody

billions and billions of strangers for all time to come

It's a nice thing to do

It made him famous that's for sure

Laughter

But Lot's wife was killed

turned into a pillar of salt

all because she could not turn her back on her friends

the wicked men of Sodom

and nobody even wrote the woman's name down

Oh to have the courage of Lot's wife

That's the kind of courage we need today

The courage to put ourselves over there

The courage that says that either all of us have to be faggots

or none of us can be faggots for any of us to be free

The courage to stand with other vagabonds in the street

with all the wretched of the earth

to form an army of the least of these

with the faith that from the naked crust of all we are

we can build a better world

Human origins

Who are we

Where do we come from

and how do we know

In my field paleoanthropology

we explore human origins 

the who and where questions 
whowhere
by analyzing fossils that date back thousands and even millions of years

In  a team of colleagues and I named a new species in the genus Homo 
Homo
our genus 

Homo naledi

Let's take a step back and put that into context

The last common ancestors between humans and chimps

date somewhere between six and eight million years

The earliest hominins

or earliest human ancestors

evolved into a group known as the australopithecines

The australopithecines evolved into the genus Homo

and eventually modern humans  us

With each new fossil discovery

we get a little bit closer to better understanding who we are

and where we came from

With these new fossil finds

we realize we now have to make changes to this tree

Until this discovery

we thought we had a pretty good idea about the patterns of evolutionary change

Current fossil evidence suggests

that the earliest populations of the genus Homo evolved in Africa

somewhere between two and three million years

Fastforward to approximately  years to where we see the origins

of the first modern humans

While the fossil record between these time frames in Africa

is relatively sparse

the fossils nonetheless demonstrated certain trends

from our earliest ancestors to modern humans

For example our brains were becoming larger

relative the rest of our body

Our pelves were becoming more bowlshaped

and our handwrist morphology or form

suggested a change in our grip as we began to make and use stone tools

and spend less time in the trees

These new fossils disrupt everything we thought we knew about these trends

and force us to change the way that we think about human evolution

South Africa in general

but the Cradle of Humankind in particular

contains numerous sites where hundreds of thousands of fossils have been found

As an undergraduate student I fell in love with one of them 

Mrs Ples

The skull of a millionyearold early human ancestor

From that point on

I was determined to go to South Africa and study human evolution

I first traveled there in 

and I did get to see my beloved Mrs Ples

Laughter

But words can hardly convey my excitement

when I was chosen as an early career scientist

by Lee Berger

a worldrenowned paleoanthropologist

to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils

This treasure trove of fossils was being recovered from a new site

called the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system

Species are often named based on a skull a lower jaw

or very rarely

a handful of postcranial or belowtheneck elements

The fossils from Dinaledi were another story altogether

An unprecedented approximately  specimens 

so far 

have been excavated from the Rising Star system

representing at least  individual skeletons

The research team that I was invited to join

was tasked with describing comparing and analyzing the fossils

with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged

We were divided up into our different areas of expertise

We were divided up in different areas of the lab too

So there was Hand Land for the fossil hand people

Hip Heaven for the pelvis 

I was in the Tooth Booth

Laughter

And after long intense days in the lab

the different teams would meet up at night and discuss our findings

still consumed by questions from our analyses

It was incredible how different the interpretations were

Each body part seemed to come from a different species

based on what we knew from the fossil record

The suite of characteristics we were seeing didn't match any known species

And if we had only recovered the skull we might have called it one thing

if we had only recovered the pelvis we might have called it another

The anatomy of the skeletons didn't make sense

with the framework of what we thought we knew of human evolution

Did it belong in the genus Homo

Should it be an australopithecine

Those bipedal more apelike ancestors

Or perhaps it should be its own species

Ultimately after much deliberation

we decided the Rising Star specimens did indeed warrant a new species

which we called Homo naledi

From the head to the feet

the fossils present a mosaic of primitive or ancestral

and derived or more modernlike features

The skull is quite derived

appearing most similar to early representatives of the genus Homo

like Homo habilis and Homo erectus

However the brain is scarcely half the size of a modern human one

One that is smaller than any other early Homo that has ever been found

As someone who studies teeth

I might argue these are the coolest fossils found at the site

Laughter

The assemblage consists of  whole or fragmentary teeth

that range in age from very old to very young

Like the skeletons

the teeth present a mix of primitive and derived traits

In modern humans

the third molar is typically the smallest while the first molar is the biggest

but Homo naledi has the primitive condition

where the third molar is the biggest and the first molar is the smallest

The anterior teeth

or the incisors and canines

are small for the genus Homo

and the lower canine has a cuspulid on it 

an extra cuspule that gives it a distinct mittenlike shape

that it shares with some specimens of the early human Homo erectus

The overall shape of the teeth looked odd to me

so I performed crownshape analysis

on the occlusal surfaces of deciduous teeth or baby teeth 

on your left 

and the permanent premolars and molars on your right

The deciduous teeth are especially narrow

and the premolars are unique in their outline shape

compared to other hominids

In fact when I compare the outlines

when I lay them on top of each other

they look very similar

We say they have low intraspecific variations

so the variation within the species is low

When I compare this to groups like the australopithecines

the intraspecific variation is much larger

Postcranially the team concluded

that the position of the shoulders suggesting naledi was a climber

the flared pelvis and curved fingers are all primitive for the genus Homo

On the other hand

the humanlike wrist long slender legs and modern feet

are all consistent with other members of the genus

In  we announced more specimens of Homo naledi

from the nearby Lesedi Chamber
Lesedi Chamber
also in the Rising Star cave system

In addition our geology team managed to produce an age estimate

The date's a big deal because up until now

we had based our analysis solely on the morphology of the specimens

without previous knowledge of how old something is 

something which could unconsciously bias our interpretations

With its small brain and flared pelvis

we would not have been surprised

if the fossils turned out to be two million years old

Instead the fossils dated

to  to  thousand years

an incredibly young date for such a smallbrained individual

So think back to what I said earlier

we thought that our brains were becoming larger relative to the rest of our body

Now we have a smallbrained young individual complicating this idea

What does all this mean

Homo naledi has taught us

that we need to reassess what it means to be in the genus Homo

We need to rethink what it means to be human

In fact most of the characteristics that we use to define the genus Homo

such as brain size and hip morphology

are no longer valid

No other species exists with this mix of primitive and derived traits

Why is there so much morphological variation in the genus Homo

And what force is driving that variation

Another implication for these fossils is that for the first time

we have concrete evidence of a species coexisting in Africa

at  years

with modern humans

Until this discovery

we only had largebrained modern humans that existed in Africa

Did they interbreed with each other

Did they compete with each other

Another implication that these fossils have

is for the archaeologists studying stone tools in South Africa

Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi nor the Lesedi Chambers

have any artifacts in them

However they do overlap in time with several stonetool industries

the makers of which are considered to be either modern humans

or direct human ancestors

This begs the question

Who made the stone tools of South Africa

Brain size has historically played a key role

in identifying a species as a tool user

The idea is that you need to have a large brain

to have even the capacity to make stone tools

But that notion has been questioned

Furthermore Homo naledi even with its small brain size

has a handwrist morphology similar to other species

that did make and use stone tools

suggesting it had the capability

With two species coexisting in Africa at  years

we can no longer assume we know the maker of tools

at sites with no associated species

So where does Homo naledi fit in our human evolutionary lineage

Who is it most closely related to

Who did it evolve from

We're still trying to figure all that out

It's ironic because paleoanthropologists are renowned

for having small sample sizes

We now have a large sample size

and more questions than answers

Homo naledi has taught us

has brought us a little bit closer

to better understanding our evolutionary past

So while Mrs Ples will always hold a special place in my heart

she now shares that space with several thousand others

Laughter

Thank you

There is a narrative

an idea that with resilience grit and personal responsibility

people can pull themselves up and achieve economic success

In the United States we call it the American dream

A similar narrative exists all over the world

But the truth is that the challenges of making this happen

have less to do with what we do

and more to do with the wealth position in which we are born

So I'm going to make the case that the United States government

actually that any government

should create a trust account for every newborn

of up to  dollars

calibrated to the wealth of the family in which they are born

I'm talking about an endowment

Personal seed capital a publicly established baby trust

what my colleague William Darity at Duke University and I

have referred to as baby bonds

a term that was coined by the late historian from Columbia University

Manning Marable

The reason why we should create these trusts is simple

Wealth is the paramount indicator of economic security and wellbeing

It provides financial agency economic security to take risk

and shield against loss

Without capital inequality is locked in

We use words like choice freedom to describe the benefits of the market

but it is literally wealth that gives us choice freedom and optionality

Wealthier families are better positioned to finance an elite independent school

and college education

access capital to start a business

finance expensive medical procedures

reside in neighborhoods with higher amenities

exert political influence through campaign finance

purchase better legal counsel

if confronted with an expensive criminal justice system

leave a bequest

andor withstand financial hardship resulting from any number of emergencies

Basically when it comes to economic security

wealth is both the beginning and the end

I will frame this conversation in the context of the United States

but this discussion applies virtually to any country

facing increasing inequality

In the US the top  percent of households

hold about  percent of the nation's wealth

while the bottom  percent owns only about one percent

But when it comes to wealth

race is an even stronger predictor than class itself

Blacks and Latinos collectively make up  percent

of the United States population

but collectively own about seven percent of the nation's wealth

The  survey of consumer finance

indicates that the typical black family has about  dollars in wealth

and that's inclusive of home equity

while the typical white family has about 

That is indicative of an absolute racial wealth gap

where the typical black household has about  cents for every dollar

held by the typical white family

But regardless of race

the market alone has been inadequate to address these inequalities

Even in times of economic expansion inequality grows

Over the last  years

wealth disparity has increased dramatically

and essentially all the economic gains from America's increase in productivity

have gone to the elite or the upper middle class

Yet much of the framing around economic disparity

focuses on the poor choices

of black Latino and poor borrowers

This framing is wrong

The directional emphasis is wrong

It is more likely that meager economic circumstance

not poor decision making or deficient knowledge

constrains choice itself and leaves people with no options

but to turn to predatory finance

In essence education is not the magic antidote

for the enormous inherited disparities

that result from laws policies and economic arrangement

This does not diminish the value of education

Indeed I'm a university professor

There are clear intrinsic values to education

along with a public responsibility

to expose everyone to a highquality education

from grade school all the way through college

But education is not the panacea

In fact blacks who live in families where the head graduated from college

typically have less wealth

than white families where the head dropped out of high school

Perhaps we overstate the functional role of education

at the detriment of understanding the functional role of wealth

Basically it is wealth that begets more wealth

That's why we advocate for baby trust

An economic birthright to capital for everyone

These accounts would be held in public trust

to be used as a foundation to an economically secure life

The concept of economic rights is not new nor is it radical

In  President Franklin Roosevelt

introduced the idea of an economic Bill of Rights

Roosevelt called for physical security

economic security social security and moral security

Unfortunately since the Nixon administration

the political sentiment regarding social mobility

has radically shifted away from government mandates to economic security

to a neoliberal approach

in which the market is presumed to be the solution for all our problems

economic or otherwise

As a result the onus of social mobility has shifted on to the individual

The pervasive narrative is that even if your lot in life is subpar

with perseverance and hard work and the virtues of the free market

you can turn your proverbial rags into riches

Of course the flip side is that the virtues of the market

will likewise sanction those that are not astute

those that lack motivation or those that are simply lazy

In other words the deserving poor will receive their just rewards

What is glaringly missing from this narrative

is the role of power and capital

and how that power and capital

can be used to alter the rules and structure of transactions and markets

in the first place

Power and capital become selfreinforcing

And without government intervention

they generate an iterative cycle of both stratification and inequality

The capital finance provided by baby trust

is intended to deliver a more egalitarian and an authentic pathway

to economic security

independent of the family financial position

in which individuals are born

The program would complement the economic rights to oldage pensions

and provide a more comprehensive social security program

designed to provide capital finance from cradle all the way through grave

We envision endowing American newborns with an average account of  dollars

that gradually rises upwards to  dollars

for babies born into the poorest families

Babies born into the wealthiest families

would be included as well in the social contract

but they would receive a more nominal account of about  dollars

The accounts would be federally managed

and they would grow at a guaranteed annual interest rate

of about two percent per year in order to curtail inflation cost

and be used when the child reaches adulthood

for some assetenhancing activity

like financing a debtfree university education

a down payment to purchase a home

or some seed capital to start a business

With approximately four million babies born each year in the US

if the average endowment of a baby trust is set at  dollars

the program would crudely cost about  billion dollars a year

This would constitute

only about two percent of current federal expenditures

and be far less than the plus billion dollars

that's already being spent by the federal government

on asset promotion through tax credits and subsidies

At issue is not the amount of that allocation

but to whom it's distributed

Currently the top one percent of households

those earning above  million dollars

receive only about one third of this entire allocation

while the bottom  percent receive only five percent

If the federal assetpromoting budget

were allocated in a more progressive manner

federal policies could be transformative for all Americans

This is a work in progress

There are obviously many details to be worked out

but it is a policy proposal grounded in the functional roles

and the inherited advantages of wealth

that moves us away from the reinforcing status quo

behavioral explanations for inequality

towards more structural solutions

Our existing tax policy that privileges existing wealth

rather than establishing new wealth is a choice

The extent of our dramatic inequality is at least as much a problem of politics

as it is a problem of economics

It is time to get beyond the false narratives

that attribute inequality to individual personal deficits

while largely ignoring the advantages of wealth

Instead public provisions of a baby trust

could go a long way towards eliminating

the transmission of economic advantage or disadvantage across generations

and establishing a more moral and decent economy

that facilitates assets economic security

and social mobility for all its citizens

Regardless of the race

and the family positions in which they are born

Thank you very much

Chris Anderson Darrick

I mean there's so much to like in this idea

There's one piece of branding around it that I worry about

which is just that right now trustfund kids have a really bad rap

You know they're the sort of eyeballrolling poster children

for how money kind of takes away motivation

So these trusts are different

So how do you show people in this proposal that it's not going to do that

Darrick Hamilton If you know you have limited resources

or you're going to face discrimination

there's a narrative that well

the economic returns to investing in myself

are lower than that of someone else

so I might as well enjoy my leisure

Of course there's another narrative as well

so we shouldn't get caught up on that

you know somebody who's poor and going to face discrimination

they also might pursue a resumebuilding strategy

The old adage I have to be twice as good as someone else

Now when we say that we never ask at what cost

are there health costs associated with that

I haven't answered your question but coming back to you question

if you know you're going to receive a transfer at a later point in life

that only increases the incentive for you to invest in yourself

so that you can better use that trust

CA You're giving people possibilities of life
CA
they currently cannot imagine having

And therefore the motivation to do that

I could talk with you for hours about this

I'm really glad you're working on this

Thank you

I want to tell you a story about stories

And I want to tell you this story because I think we need to remember

that sometimes the stories we tell each other

are more than just tales or entertainment or narratives

They're also vehicles

for sowing inspiration and ideas across our societies

and across time

The story I'm about to tell you

is about how one of the most advanced technological achievements

of the modern era

has its roots in stories

and how some of the most important transformations yet to come might also

The story begins over  years ago

when Galileo Galilei first learned of the recent Dutch invention

that took two pieces of shaped glass and put them in a long tube

and thereby extended human sight farther than ever before

When Galileo turned his new telescope to the heavens

and to the Moon in particular

he discovered something incredible

These are pages from Galileo's book Sidereus Nuncius published in 

And in them he revealed to the world what he had discovered

And what he discovered was that the Moon was not just a celestial object

wandering across the night sky

but rather it was a world

a world with high sunlit mountains

and dark mare the Latin word for seas

And once this new world and the Moon had been discovered

people immediately began to think about how to travel there

And just as importantly

they began to write stories

about how that might happen

and what those voyages might be like

One of the first people to do so was actually the Bishop of Hereford

a man named Francis Godwin

Godwin wrote a story about a Spanish explorer

Domingo Gonsales

who ended up marooned on the island of St Helena

in the middle of the Atlantic

and there in an effort to get home

developed a machine an invention

to harness the power of the local wild geese

to allow him to fly 

and eventually to embark on a voyage to the Moon

Godwin's book The Man in the Moone or a Discourse of a Voyage Thither

was only published posthumously and anonymously in 

likely on account of the number of controversial ideas that it contained

including an endorsement of the Copernican view of the universe

that put the Sun at the center of the Solar System

as well as a preNewtonian concept of gravity

that had the idea that the weight of an object

would decrease with increasing distance from Earth

And that's to say nothing of his idea of a goose machine

that could go to the Moon

Laughter

And while this idea of a voyage to the Moon by goose machine

might not seem particularly insightful or technically creative to us today

what's important is that Godwin described getting to the Moon not by a dream

or by magic as Johannes Kepler had written about

but rather through human invention

And it was this idea that we could build machines

that could travel into the heavens

that would plant its seed in minds across the generations

The idea was next taken up by his contemporary John Wilkins
John Wilkins
then just a young student at Oxford

but later one of the founders of the Royal Society

John Wilkins took the idea of space travel in Godwin's text seriously

and wrote not just another story

but a nonfiction philosophical treatise

entitled Discovery of the New World in the Moon

or a Discourse Tending to Prove

that 'tis Probable There May Be Another Habitable World in that Planet

And note by the way that word habitable

That idea in itself would have been a powerful incentive

for people thinking about how to build machines that could go there

In his books Wilkins seriously considered a number of technical methods

for spaceflight

and it remains to this day the earliest known nonfiction account

of how we might travel to the Moon

Other stories would soon follow most notably by Cyrano de Bergerac
Cyrano de Bergerac
with his Lunar Tales

By the midth century the idea of people building machines

that could travel to the heavens

was growing in complexity and technical nuance

And yet in the late th century

this intellectual progress effectively ceased

People still told stories about getting to the Moon

but they relied on the old ideas

or once again on dreams or on magic

Why

Well because the discovery of the laws of gravity by Newton

and the invention of the vacuum pump by Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle

meant that people now understood

that a condition of vacuum existed between the planets

and consequentially between the Earth and the Moon

And they had no way of overcoming this

no way of thinking about overcoming this

And so for well over a century

the idea of a voyage to the Moon made very little intellectual progress

until the rise of the Industrial Revolution

and the development of steam engines and boilers

and most importantly pressure vessels

And these gave people the tools to think about how they could build a capsule

that could resist the vacuum of space

So it was in this context in 

that the next great story of spaceflight was written

by Edgar Allan Poe

Now today we think of Poe in terms of gothic poems

and telltale hearts and ravens

But he considered himself a technical thinker

He grew up in Baltimore

the first American city with gas street lighting

and he was fascinated by the technological revolution

that he saw going on all around him

He considered his own greatest work not to be one of his gothic tales

but rather his epic prose poem Eureka

in which he expounded his own personal view

of the cosmographical nature of the universe

In his stories he would describe in fantastical technical detail

machines and contraptions

and nowhere was he more influential in this than in his short story

The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall

It's a story of an unemployed bellows maker in Rotterdam

who depressed and tired of life  this is Poe after all 

and deeply in debt

he decides to build a hermetically enclosed balloonborne carriage

that is launched into the air by dynamite

and from there floats through the vacuum of space

all the way to the lunar surface

And importantly he did not develop this story alone

for in the appendix to his tale

he explicitly acknowledged Godwin's A Man in the Moone

from over  years earlier

as an influence

calling it a singular and somewhat ingenious little book

And although this idea of a balloonborne voyage to the Moon may seem

not much more technically sophisticated than the goose machine

in fact Poe was sufficiently detailed

in the description of the construction of the device

and in terms of the orbital dynamics of the voyage

that it could be diagrammed in the very first spaceflight encyclopedia

as a mission in the s

And it was this attention to detail or to verisimilitude as he called it

that would influence the next great story

Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon written in 

And it's a story that has a remarkable legacy

and a remarkable similarity to the real voyages to the Moon

that would take place over a hundred years later

Because in the story the first voyage to the Moon takes place from Florida

with three people on board

in a trip that takes three days 

exactly the parameters that would prevail during the Apollo program itself

And in an explicit tribute to Poe's influence on him

Verne situated the group responsible for this feat in the book in Baltimore

at the Baltimore Gun Club

with its members shouting Cheers for Edgar Poe

as they began to lay out their plans for their conquest of the Moon

And just as Verne was influenced by Poe

so too would Verne's own story go on to influence and inspire

the first generation of rocket scientists

The two great pioneers of liquid fuel rocketry in Russia and in Germany

Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth
Konstantin TsiolkovskyHermann Oberth
both traced their own commitment to the field of spaceflight

to their reading From the Earth to the Moon as teenagers

and then subsequently committing themselves

to trying to make that story a reality

And Verne's story was not the only one in the th century

with a long arm of influence

On the other side of the Atlantic

HG Wells's War of the Worlds directly inspired
HG 
a young man in Massachusetts Robert Goddard

And it was after reading War of the Worlds

that Goddard wrote in his diary

one day in the late s

of resting while trimming a cherry tree on his family's farm

and having a vision of a spacecraft taking off from the valley below

and ascending into the heavens

And he decided then and there that he would commit the rest of his life

to the development of the spacecraft that he saw in his mind's eye

And he did exactly that

Throughout his career he would celebrate that day

as his anniversary day his cherry tree day

and he would regularly read and reread the works of Verne and of Wells

in order to renew his inspiration and his commitment

over the decades of labor and effort that would be required

to realize the first part of his dream

the flight of a liquid fuel rocket

which he finally achieved in 

So it was while reading From the Earth to the Moon and The War of the Worlds

that the first pioneers of astronautics were inspired to dedicate their lives

to solving the problems of spaceflight

And it was their treatises and their works in turn

that inspired the first technical communities

and the first projects of spaceflight

thus creating a direct chain of influence

that goes from Godwin to Poe to Verne

to the Apollo program

and to the presentday communities of spaceflight

So why I have told you all this

Is it just because I think it's cool

or because I'm just weirdly fascinated by stories

of th and thcentury science fiction

It is admittedly partly that

But I also think that these stories remind us

of the cultural processes driving spaceflight

and even technological innovation more broadly

As an economist working at NASA
NASA
I spend time thinking about the economic origins

of our movement out into the cosmos

And when you look before the investments of billionaire tech entrepreneurs

and before the Cold War Space Race

and even before the military investments in liquid fuel rocketry

the economic origins of spaceflight are found in stories and in ideas

It was in these stories that the first concepts for spaceflight were articulated

And it was through these stories

that the narrative of a future for humanity in space

began to propagate from mind to mind

eventually creating an intergenerational intellectual community

that would iterate on the ideas for spacecraft

until such a time as they could finally be built

This process has now been going on for over  years

and the result is a culture of spaceflight

It's a culture that involves thousands of people

over hundreds of years

Because for hundreds of years some of us have looked at the stars

and longed to go

And because for hundreds of years

some of us have dedicated our labors

to the development of the concepts and systems

required to make those voyages possible

I also wanted to tell you about Godwin Poe and Verne

because I think their stories also tell us of the importance

of the stories that we tell each other about the future more generally

Because these stories don't just transmit information or ideas

They can also nurture passions

passions that can lead us to dedicate our lives

to the realization of important projects

Which means that these stories can and do

influence social and technological forces

centuries into the future

I think we need to realize this and remember it when we tell our stories

We need to work hard to write stories

that don't just show us the possible dystopian paths we may take

for a fear that the more dystopian stories we tell each other

the more we plant seeds for possible dystopian futures

Instead we need to tell stories that plant the seeds

if not necessarily for utopias

then at least for great new projects of technological societal

and institutional transformation

And if we think of this idea that the stories we tell each other

can transform the future

is fanciful or impossible

then I think we need to remember the example of this

our voyage to the Moon

an idea from the th century

that propagated culturally for over  years

until it could finally be realized

So we need to write new stories

stories that  years in the future

people will be able to look back upon and remark

how they inspired us to new heights and to new shores

how they showed us new paths and new possibilities

and how they shaped our world for the better

Thank you

Its  in the morning

and Kristen is wheeling her prostate patient into the OR

She's a resident a surgeon in training

Its her job to learn

Today shes really hoping to do some of the nervesparing

extremely delicate dissection that can preserve erectile function

That'll be up to the attending surgeon though but he's not there yet

She and the team put the patient under

and she leads the initial eightinch incision in the lower abdomen

Once shes got that clamped back she tells the nurse to call the attending

He arrives gowns up

And from there on in their four hands are mostly in that patient 

with him guiding but Kristin leading the way

When the prostates out and yes he let Kristen do a little nerve sparing

he rips off his scrubs

He starts to do paperwork

Kristen closes the patient by 

with a junior resident looking over her shoulder

And she lets him do the final line of sutures

Kristen feels great

Patients going to be fine

and no doubt shes a better surgeon than she was at 

Now this is extreme work

But Kristins learning to do her job the way that most of us do

watching an expert for a bit

getting involved in easy safe parts of the work

and progressing to riskier and harder tasks

as they guide and decide shes ready

My whole life Ive been fascinated by this kind of learning

It feels elemental part of what makes us human

It has different names apprenticeship coaching mentorship on the job training

In surgery its called see one do one teach one

But the process is the same

and its been the main path to skill around the globe for thousands of years

Right now were handling AI in a way that blocks that path

Were sacrificing learning in our quest for productivity

I found this first in surgery while I was at MIT

but now Ive got evidence its happening all over

in very different industries and with very different kinds of AI

If we do nothing millions of us are going to hit a brick wall

as we try to learn to deal with AI

Lets go back to surgery to see how

Fast forward six months

Its am again and Kristen is wheeling another prostate patient in

but this time to the robotic OR

The attending leads attaching

a fourarmed thousandpound robot to the patient

They both rip off their scrubs

head to control consoles  or  feet away

and Kristen just watches

The robot allows the attending to do the whole procedure himself

so he basically does

He knows she needs practice

He wants to give her control

But he also knows shed be slower and make more mistakes

and his patient comes first

So Kristin has no hope of getting anywhere near those nerves during this rotation

Shell be lucky if she operates more than  minutes during a fourhour procedure

And she knows that when she slips up

hell tap a touch screen and shell be watching again

feeling like a kid in the corner with a dunce cap

Like all the studies of robots and work Ive done in the last eight years

I started this one with a big open question

How do we learn to work with intelligent machines

To find out I spent two and a half years observing dozens of residents and surgeons

doing traditional and robotic surgery interviewing them

and in general hanging out with the residents as they tried to learn

I covered  of the top US teaching hospitals

and the story was the same

Most residents were in Kristen's shoes

They got to see one plenty

but the do one was barely available

So they couldnt struggle and they werent learning

This was important news for surgeons but I needed to know how widespread it was

Where else was using AI blocking learning on the job

To find out Ive connected with a small but growing group of young researchers

whove done bootsontheground studies of work involving AI

in very diverse settings like startups policing

investment banking and online education

Like me they spent at least a year and many hundreds of hours observing

interviewing and often working sidebyside with the people they studied

We shared data and I looked for patterns

No matter the industry the work the AI the story was the same

Organizations were trying harder and harder to get results from AI

and they were peeling learners away from expert work as they did it

Startup managers were outsourcing their customer contact

Cops had to learn to deal with crime forecasts without experts support

Junior bankers were getting cut out of complex analysis

and professors had to build online courses without help

And the effect of all of this was the same as in surgery

Learning on the job was getting much harder

This cant last

McKinsey estimates that between half a billion and a billion of us

are going to have to adapt to AI in our daily work by 

And were assuming that onthejob learning

will be there for us as we try

Accentures latest workers survey showed that most workers learned key skills
Accenture
on the job not in formal training

So while we talk a lot about its potential future impact

the aspect of AI that may matter most right now

is that were handling it in a way that blocks learning on the job

just when we need it most

Now across all our sites a small minority found a way to learn

They did it by breaking and bending rules

Approved methods werent working so they bent and broke rules

to get handson practice with experts

In my setting residents got involved in robotic surgery in medical school

at the expense of their generalist education

And they spent hundreds of extra hours with simulators and recordings of surgery

when you were supposed to learn in the OR

And maybe most importantly they found ways to struggle

in live procedures with limited expert supervision

I call all this shadow learning because it bends the rules

and learners do it out of the limelight

And everyone turns a blind eye because it gets results

Remember these are the star pupils of the bunch

Now obviously this is not OK and its not sustainable

No one should have to risk getting fired

to learn the skills they need to do their job

But we do need to learn from these people

They took serious risks to learn

They understood they needed to protect struggle and challenge in their work

so that they could push themselves to tackle hard problems

right near the edge of their capacity

They also made sure there was an expert nearby

to offer pointers and to backstop against catastrophe

Lets build this combination of struggle and expert support

into each AI implementation
AI
Heres one clear example I could get of this on the ground

Before robots

if you were a bomb disposal technician you dealt with an IED by walking up to it

A junior officer was hundreds of feet away

so could only watch and help if you decided it was safe

and invited them downrange

Now you sit sidebyside in a bombproof truck

You both watched the video feed

They control a distant robot and you guide the work out loud

Trainees learn better than they did before robots

We can scale this to surgery startups policing

investment banking online education and beyond

The good news is weve got new tools to do it

The internet and the cloud mean we dont always need one expert for every trainee

for them to be physically near each other or even to be in the same organization

And we can build AI to help

to coach learners as they struggle to coach experts as they coach

and to connect those two groups in smart ways

There are people at work on systems like this

but theyve been mostly focused on formal training

And the deeper crisis is in onthejob learning

We must do better

Todays problems demand we do better

to create work that takes full advantage of AIs amazing capabilities

while enhancing our skills as we do it

Thats the kind of future I dreamed of as a kid

And the time to create it is now

Thank you

Applause

What I'm about to share with you are findings from a study

of the brains of more than  children and adolescents

Now these were children who were recruited

from diverse homes around the United States

and this picture is an average of all of their brains

The front of this average brain is on your left

and the back of this average brain is on your right

Now one of the things we were very interested in

was the surface area of the cerebral cortex

or the thin wrinkly layer on the outer surface of the brain

that does most of the cognitive heavy lifting

And that's because past work by other scientists has suggested

that in many cases

a larger cortical surface area

is often associated with higher intelligence

Now in this study we found one factor

that was associated with the cortical surface area

across nearly the entire surface of the brain

That factor was family income

Now here every point you see in color is a point where higher family income

was associated with a larger cortical surface area in that spot

And there were some regions shown here in yellow

where that association was particularly pronounced

And those are regions that we know support a certain set of cognitive skills

language skills like vocabulary and reading

as well as the ability to avoid distraction

and exert selfcontrol

And that's important

because those are the very skills

that children living in poverty are most likely to struggle with

In fact a child living with poverty

is likely to perform worse on tests of language and impulse control

before they even turn two

Now there are a few points I'd like to highlight about this study

Number one

this link between family income and children's brain structure

was strongest at the lowest income levels

So that means that dollar for dollar

relatively small differences in family income

were associated with proportionately greater differences in brain structure

among the most disadvantaged families

And intuitively that makes sense right

An extra  dollars for a family earning say  dollars a year

would certainly be nice but probably not gamechanging

whereas an extra  dollars

for a family only earning  dollars a year

would likely make a remarkable difference in their daytoday lives

Now the second point I'd like to highlight

is that this link between family income and children's brain structure

didn't depend on the children's age

it didn't depend on their sex

and it didn't depend on their race or ethnicity

And the final point 

and this one's key 

there was tremendous variability from one child to the next

by which I mean there were plenty of children from higherincome homes

with smaller brain surfaces

and plenty of children from lowerincome homes

with larger brain surfaces

Here's an analogy

We all know that in childhood

boys tend to be taller than girls

but go into any elementary school classroom

and you'll find some girls who are taller than some boys

So while growing up in poverty is certainly a risk factor

for a smaller brain surface

in no way can I know an individual child's family income

and know with any accuracy

what that particular child's brain would look like

I want you to imagine for a moment two children

One is a young child born into poverty in America

the other is also an American child

but one who was born into more fortunate circumstances

Now at birth we find absolutely no differences

in how their brains work

But by the time those two kids are ready to start kindergarten

we know that the child living in poverty

is likely to have cognitive scores that are on average  percent lower

than those of the other child

Later on that child living in poverty

will be five times more likely to drop out of high school

and if she does graduate high school

she'll be less likely to earn a college degree

By the time those two kids are  years old

if the first child spent her entire childhood living in poverty

she is up to  times more likely to be poor herself

But it doesn't have to be that way

As a neuroscientist one of things I find most exciting about the human brain

is that our experiences change our brains

Now this concept known as neuroplasticity

means that these differences in children's brain structure

don't doom a child to a life of low achievement

The brain is not destiny

And if a child's brain can be changed

then anything is possible

As a society we spend billions of dollars each year educating our children

So what can we tell schools teachers and parents

who want to help support kids from disadvantaged backgrounds

to do their best in school and in life

Well emerging science suggests

that growing up in poverty is associated with a host of different experiences

and that these experiences in turn may work together

to help shape brain development and ultimately help kids learn

And so if this is right

it begs the question

Where along this pathway can we step in and provide help

So let's consider first intervening at the level of learning itself 

most commonly through schoolbased initiatives

Now should we be encouraging teachers to focus on the kinds of skills

that disadvantaged kids are most likely to struggle with

Of course

The importance of highquality education based in scientific evidence

really can't be overstated

And there are a number of examples of excellent interventions

targeting things like literacy or selfregulation

that do in fact improve kids' cognitive development and their test scores

But as any intervention scientist doing this work would tell you

this work is challenging

It's hard to implement highquality evidencebased education

And it can be laborintensive

it's sometimes costly

And in many cases these disparities in child development emerge early 

well before the start of formal schooling 

sometimes when kids are just toddlers

And so I would argue

school is very important

but if we're focusing all of our policy efforts

on formal schooling

we're probably starting too late

So what about taking a step back

and focusing on trying to change children's experiences

What particular experiences are associated with growing up in poverty

and might be able to be targeted to promote brain development

and learning outcomes for kids

Of course there are many right

Nutrition access to health care

exposure to secondhand smoke or lead

experience of stress or discrimination

to name a few

In my laboratory

we're particularly focused on a few types of experiences

that we believe may be able to be targeted

to promote children's brain development

and ultimately improve their learning outcomes

As one example

take something I'll call the home language environment

by which I mean we know that the number of words kids hear

and the number of conversations they're engaged in every day

can vary tremendously

By some estimates

kids from more advantaged backgrounds

hear an average of  million more spoken words

in the first few years of life

compared to kids from less advantaged backgrounds

Now in our work we're finding

that kids who experience more backandforth

responsive conversational turns

tend to have a larger brain surface in parts of the brain

that we know are responsible for language and reading skills

And in fact the number of conversations they hear

seems to matter a little bit more than the sheer number of words they hear

So one tantalizing possibility

is that we should be teaching parents not just to talk a lot

but to actually have more conversations with their children

In this way it's possible that we'll promote brain development

and perhaps their kids' language and reading skills

And in fact a number of scientists are testing

that exciting possibility right now

But of course we all know

that growing up in poverty is associated with lots of different experiences

beyond just how many conversations kids are having

So how do we choose what else to focus on

The list can be overwhelming

There are a number of highquality interventions

that do try to change children's experience

many of which are quite effective

But again just like schoolbased initiatives

this is hard work

It can be challenging

it can be laborintensive

sometimes costly 

and on occasion

it can be somewhat patronizing for scientists to swoop in

and tell a family what they need to change in order for their child to succeed

So I want to share an idea with you

What if we tried to help young children in poverty

by simply giving their families more money

I'm privileged to be working with a team of economists

social policy experts and neuroscientists

in leading Baby's First Years

the firstever randomized study

to test whether poverty reduction causes changes in children's brain development

Now the ambition of the study is large

but the premise is actually quite simple

In May of 

we began recruiting  mothers living below the federal poverty line

shortly after they gave birth in a number of American hospitals

Upon enrolling in our study

all mothers receive an unconditional monthly cash gift

for the first  months of their children's lives

and they're free to use this money however they like

But importantly mothers are being randomized

so some mothers are randomized to receive a nominal monthly cash gift

and others are randomized to receive several hundred dollars each month

an amount that we believe is large enough

to make a difference in their daytoday lives

in most cases increasing their monthly income by  to  percent

So in this way

we're hoping to finally move past questions

of how poverty is correlated with child development

and actually be able to test whether reducing poverty causes changes

in children's cognitive emotional and brain development

in the first three years of life 

the very time when we believe

the developing brain may be most malleable to experience

Now we won't have definitive results from this study for several years

and if nothing else

 newborns and their moms will have a bit more cash each month

that they tell us they very much need

But what if it turns out that a costeffective way

to help young children in poverty

is to simply give their moms more money

If our hypotheses are borne out

it's our hope that results from this work will inform debates about social services

that have the potential to effect millions of families with young children

Because while income may not be the only or even the most important factor

in determining children's brain development

it may be one that

from a policy perspective

can be easily addressed

Put simply

if we can show that reducing poverty changes how children's brains develop

and that leads to meaningful policy changes

then a young child born into poverty today

may have a much better shot at a brighter future

Thank you

Big boys don't cry

Suck it up

Shut up and rub some dirt on it

Stop crying before I give you something to cry about

These are just a few of the phrases

that contribute to a disease in our society

and more specifically in our men

It's a disease that has come to be known as toxic masculinity

It's one I suffered a chronic case of

so much so that I spent  years of a life sentence in prison

for kidnapping robbery and attempted murder

Yet I'm here to tell you today that there's a solution for this epidemic

I know for a fact the solution works because I was a part of human trials

The solution is a mixture of elements

It begins with the willingness to look at your belief system

and how out of alignment it is

and how your actions negatively impact not just yourself

but the people around you

The next ingredient is the willingness to be vulnerable with people

who would not just support you but hold you accountable

But before I tell you about this

I need to let you know that in order to share this

I have to bare my soul in full

And as I stand here

with so many eyes fixed on me

I feel raw and naked

When this feeling is present

I'm confident that the next phase of healing is on the horizon

and that allows me to share my story in full

For all appearances' sake I was born into the ideal family dynamic

mother father sister brother

Bertha Eldra Jr Taydama and Eldra III
BerthaEldra JrTaydamaEldra III
That's me

My father was a Vietnam veteran who earned a Purple Heart

and made it home to find love marry and begin his own brood

So how did I wind up serving life in the California prison system

Keeping secrets

believing the mantra that big boys don't cry

not knowing how to display any emotion confidently other than anger

participating in athletics

and learning that the greater the performance on the field

the less the need to worry about the rules off it

It's hard to pin down any one specific ingredient

of the many symptoms that ailed me

Growing up as a young black male in Sacramento California in the s

there were two groups I identified as having respect

athletes and gangsters

I excelled in sports

that is until a friend and I chose to take his mom's car for a joyride and wreck it

With my parents having to split the cost of a totaled vehicle

I was relegated to a summer of household chores and no sports

No sports meant no respect

No respect equaled no power

Power was vital to feed my illness

It was at that point the decision to transition from athlete to gangster

was made and done so easily

Early life experiences had set the stage for me to be wellsuited

to objectify others

act in a socially detached manner

and above all else seek to be viewed as in a position of power

A sense of power

Sighs

equaled strength in my environment

but more importantly it did so in my mind

My mind dictated my choices

My subsequent choices put me on the fast track to prison life

And even once in prison I continued my history

of running over the rights of others

even knowing that that was the place that I would die

Once again I wound up in solitary confinement

for stabbing another prisoner nearly  times

I'd gotten to a place where I didn't care how I lived or if I died

But then things changed

One of the best things that happened in my life to that point

was being sent to New Folsom Prison

Once there I was approached to join a group called Inside Circle
Inside Circle
Initially I was hesitant to join a group referred to around the yard

as hugathug

Laughter

Initially yeah that was a little much

but eventually I overcame my hesitancy

As it turned out the circle was the vision of a man named Patrick Nolan

who was also serving life

and who had grown sick and tired of being sick and tired

of watching us kill one another

over skin color

rag color

being from Northern or Southern California

or just plain breathing in the wrong direction on a windy day

Circle time is men sitting with men

and cutting through the bullshit

challenging structural ways of thinking

I think the way that I think

and I act the way that I act

because I hadn't questioned that

Like who said I should see a woman walking down the street

turn around and check out her backside

Where did that come from

If I don't question that I'll just go along with the crowd

The lockerroom talk

In circle we sit and we question these things

Why do I think the way that I think

Why do I act the way that I act

Because when I get down to it I'm not thinking

I'm not being an individual

I'm not taking responsibility for who I am

and what it is I put into this world

It was in a circle session that my life took a turn

I remember being asked who I was

and I didn't have an answer

at least not one that felt honest

in a room full of men who were seeking truth

It would have been easy to say

I'm a Blood

or My name is Vegas

or any number of facades I had manufactured to hide behind

It was in that moment and in that venue that the jig was up

I realized that as sharp as I believed I was

I didn't even know who I was

or why I acted the way that I acted

I couldn't stand in a room full of men who were seeking to serve and support

and present an authentic me

It was in that moment that I graduated to a place within

that was ready for transformation

For decades

I kept being the victim of molestation at the hands of a babysitter a secret

I submitted to this under the threat of my younger sister being harmed

I was seven she was three

I believed it was my responsibility to keep her safe

It was in that instant

that the seeds were sown for a long career of hurting others

be it physical mental or emotional

I developed in that instant

at seven years old

the belief that going forward in life

if a situation presented itself where someone was going to get hurt

I would be the one doing the hurting

I also formulated the belief that loving put me in harm's way

I also learned that caring about another person made me weak

So not caring that must equal strength

The greatest way to mask a shaky sense of self

is to hide behind a false air of respect

Sitting in circle resembles sitting in a fire

It is a crucible that can and does break

It broke my old sense of self

diseased value system

and way of looking at others

My old stale modes of thinking were invited into the open

to see if this is who I wanted to be in life

I was accompanied by skilled facilitators

on a journey into the depths of myself

to find those wounded parts that not only festered

but seeped out to create unsafe space for others

At times it resembled an exorcism

and in essence it was

There was an extraction of old diseased ways of thinking

being and reacting

and an infusion of purpose

Sitting in those circles saved my life

I stand here today as a testament to the fact of the power of the work

I was paroled in June 

following my third hearing before a panel of former lawenforcement officials

who were tasked with determining my current threat level to society

I stand here today for the first time since I was  years old

not under any form of state supervision

I'm married to a tremendous woman named Holly

and together we are raising two sons

who I encourage to experience emotions in a safe way

I let them hold me when I cry

They get to witness me not have all the answers

My desire is for them to understand

that being a man is not some machismo caricature

and that characteristics usually defined as weaknesses

are parts of the whole healthy man

So today I continue to work not just on myself

but in support of young males in my community

The challenge is to eradicate this cycle

of emotional illiteracy and groupthink

that allows our males to continue to victimize others as well as themselves

As a result of this

they develop new ways of how they want to show up in the world

and how they expect this world to show up on their behalf

Thank you

Applause

Yes it's dark

I'm wondering how long we can all stand it

without picking up our phone and turning the flashlights on

Seconds

Minutes

A whole hour

Don't worry I'm not going to give you my whole speech in the dark

But it's something I'm used to

For more than  years I and two million people back home

have been living in darkness

locked between two borders

that are nearly impossible to leave literally

in an area that spans  miles long and about five miles wide

I am Palestinian and I am from Gaza

I grew up there and I still live there

In Gaza we have a whole lot of nothing

And I aim to create something from that nothing

When a community is cut off from the world

all that we need to do is  what

To think outside the box

Way outside the box

That thinking led me to two projects

to address two serious issues in my community

The need for building materials and the need for electricity and energy

Two essential ingredients of life

Both are in lack of supply in Gaza

First I'm not here 

just to talk about the occupation we have back home

The siege the wars the bombs the protests

or the death toll

I am here because I wanted to show that we can live through it all

I am here because I wanted to make a change

I am here to tell you

that I am a statistic that cannot be ignored

In the  war thousands of houses were destroyed

Those houses were made from sunbaked stones and blocks

Those houses stood for decades and decades

Those houses were for my family friends neighbors

everyone I know

At that time I asked myself a question

What can I do for people

How can I help them

I knew we weren't able to get cement aggregate and sand

to rebuild what the war destroyed

But also maybe we can use something from inside the community

something we already had

I started to put things together

First paper as a filler instead of the aggregate we import

But that did not work out

What about using glass powder to replace part of the cement

But that failed too

I guessed making building blocks out of mud would be a great idea

But unfortunately it didn't work out

During the process of burning the mud blocks

we had a huge amount of ashes

And I was like Why don't we use those ashes

The idea flashed in my mind

Let's use it and combine it with the rubble of the demolished houses

and make building blocks out of it

After more than  failed experiments

and over six months of research

I actually made it

Applause

I created a building block

out of the ashes and rubble of the demolished houses

It's here it came all the way with me

Well it came before me

So it's lighter

it's cheaper and it's stronger

Applause

This building block 

of course you ask yourself How did this girl do it

It's not that hard and it's not that easy

First we collected rubble from all around the Gaza Strip

Then we combined it with the ashes that came from the landfills

When the recipe is done it's time for baking

So we mold the blocks as you can see in the photo

and we cure it using water steam

I call the material Green Cake

and people now can use it not only to rebuild old houses

but also to build new complete structures

Green Cake so far has created jobs for more than  people

And we were able to rebuild around  apartments

each one of them the size of a household almost for eight people

We also trained fresh graduates female and male

which is not very common in the community

And we got several awards locally and globally

This block is not just only a building block

It changed the stereotype about women in Gaza

that stated this type of work is meant for men

Education is the strongest weapon we have

to fight for our freedom decent life and future

My background helped me to do this block

I went to the Islamic University of Gaza and I studied civil engineering

where there was a onetosix femaletomale ratio

Everyone told me I would end up without a job

I went for a major that's meant for men

But their lack of encouragement did not deter me it inspired me
 
Applause

After this long journey with the block and after two years

what Gaza does need is not just building blocks

We also need electricity we need the energy

I developed a new company called SunBox
SunBox
SunBox is a smart solar kit that we source from China
SunBox
and we engineer it to fit the market need

It powers not only light but also laptops phones

internet connection a fan or a TV

We teach local vendors and technicians

to sell install and provide customer services for people

We got the project off the ground

by providing  families with solar energy

One of the solar units we installed in a refugee camp

The next day I came to check what happened with the solar

and I found a whole neighborhood watching a football match

using our device

I was like Wow that's going to create a huge impact in the community

That encouraged us to go to the second round

of bringing  units

But each unit costs around  dollars

And a Palestinian family can't afford the  dollars

So we had to think again outside the box

How can we make this happen

If a whole neighborhood can watch a football match using one device

it means two three and four families can share one device

and enjoy the electricity

What we did is we created a new business model

called sharing is caring

Laughter

The sharing is caring business model

says two families share one unit three families share one unit

and they split the cost so they can afford paying for it

Well the idea caught on

I didn't expect that but it just happened

In less than two weeks

we were able to provide over  people with electricity

Applause

And the question here How did the idea catch on

We went to community centers 

those are places you know for whom

Only for men

So it was so weird for a woman to go there

And I told them We have a great idea

We will give you electricity

you give us people who need this electricity

Now families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip

I received a phone call from the team this morning saying

Majd please we are under pressure we work  hours a day

we will not be able to work like this

Families are calling us every second They want solar energy

Muna from one of the families we installed the solar unit for

she told me You know Majd

I've never imagined I will control something in my life

Now I can control my source of energy

I feel so special

What you take for granted is a privilege for others

People like Muna

She doesn't want to fight

She doesn't want to stay in a bad life

She's only looking for a better life

Our vision or I would say everyone's vision in Gaza 

which I am very privileged to represent the people back home 

is to have a good life a future

We need to build the infrastructure of hope

We want to tell them it's possible to happen

it's possible to be treated as a human being

I don't have to cross four borders to come here

I can just go to the airport

see the people outside

see what the world looks like

Thank you so much

Applause

It's story time

Settle back and I'll begin

Once upon a time a mother duck sat patiently on her nest of eggs

waiting for them to hatch

And then one day she felt something move beneath her

Crack crack

Filled with happiness she watched as her eggs hatched one by one

I don't know about you but when I was little

story time was always one of my favorite parts of the day

And I loved reading to my two sons when they were small too

It's that special time

when a parent and child can be totally absorbed together

in mystical kingdoms fantastical beasties

or scruffy little ducks that turn out to be swans

Well that's how it is for some children

but for other children

there isn't a parent around to read to them

I'd like to tell you about Sophie

Sophie's five years old and lives with her parents

One day there's a bang at the door

Sophie hears lots of shouting her mum's crying
 
She sees the police dragging her father away

Sophie's afraid She starts crying too

Weeks go by

Sophie doesn't know what's happened to her dad

When she asks her mum her mum gets upset

So she stops asking

Sophie waits

She really misses her dad

Every day she hurries home from school in case he's come back

On many nights she cries herself to sleep

Children at school start to tease her

They call her names

Somebody's mum has heard that Sophie's dad is in prison

Sophie pretends to be ill so she doesn't have to go to school

And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind

with her schoolwork

After what seems a long long time to Sophie

a letter arrives

It's from her dad

The writing is very messy

The letter makes her mum cry but she reads a little out to Sophie

He says that he's OK and that he's missing them

It's a short letter

Sophie says she'd like to go and see her dad wherever he is

But her mum says it's too far away and they can't afford the journey

Then one day the phone rings

Sophie come speak to daddy

Dad sounds different far away

He says he can't talk for very long

and anyway it's very noisy wherever he is

And Sophie doesn't know what to say to him

Well as stories go that's not a very nice one

In the United Kingdom  children

experience the shame and isolation of a parent in prison

Two hundred thousand

That's more than the number of children each year

who are affected by their parents divorcing

And it can affect the children of prisoners very deeply

There can be problems at school

and they're three times more likely to suffer from mental health issues

In so many ways

children are the unintended victims of their parents' crimes

In so many ways

children are the overlooked victims of their parents' crimes

Until last November I was a serving prisoner

imprisoned for fraud

I was dishonest and I paid the penalty

Before that I'd been a practicing solicitor for  years

I'd had a happy and stable upbringing

a good education

a happy marriage which I'm pleased to say continues

I have two adult sons

When they were growing up I did my best to be around for them

as much as I could

And I took a careful interest in what they did

I read to my boys every night

and ironically our favorite story was Burglar Bill
Burglar Bill
Laughter

But when I got to prison it soon became apparent

that my background was very different to that of most of the prisoners

Few of the men that I met had had a decent education

Indeed many associated education with humiliation and failure

I can tell you firsthand that prison is dehumanizing

Prisoners harden up they shut down they close in 

just to survive

And this can be devastating for families

In fact maintaining contact with your family from prison

can be very difficult indeed

And if a child does get to see their parent in prison

they have to go through the same patdown searches as the adults

They walk through the same detector frames

they're sniffed by the same sniffer dogs

and all because some children have been the unwitting carriers

of drugs and mobile phones

And when they get through to see their parent

they may be tired from a long journey

shy tonguetied even upset

And it isn't easy for the parents who may not be getting along

For many reasons not just these

over half of prisoners lose contact with their children and families

How can we help prisoners to stay in contact with their families

When I was a prisoner at Channings Wood Prison
Channings Wood
I began working for a charity called Storybook Dads

Storybook Dads began in 

when Sharon Berry a civilian worker in a prison realized just how much

many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children

And so armed with a few storybooks

she began to help prisoners to read and record stories

to send home to their children

It wasn't a new idea Few ideas like this are new

They're great ideas

But it was an instant success

You may wonder How does the recording of the stories work in prison

Is it difficult for prisoners

Can it be challenging

Well the process of choosing reading and recording a story

can be very challenging for prisoners

Prison is tough

and prisoners can't afford to show any signs of weakness or vulnerability

But this this recording process

this can be uncomfortable upsetting sometimes all just a bit too much

And prisoners often cry

They cry because they regret missing out on their children's lives

They cry because they're ashamed that they've let their families down

They cry because they don't know how to go about reading to their children

But because when they come to us we offer a private space onetoone

prisoners don't need to be tough anymore

and they can use their vulnerability as a strength

when contacting with their children

I remember one prisoner who came to record

He was a big hard man with a reputation for being tough

He came along as implacable as ever

But when the door of the recording room closed behind him

that facade began to crumble

From his pocket he took a screwedup piece of paper

and quietly began to read the words

which he'd written as a message for his two little ones

His hands were shaking

And then in a surprisingly quiet voice

he began to sing their favorite lullaby

You see there wasn't much that he could do from behind bars

to show his children that he missed and loved them

But he could do this

Once the recording is made

it's sent to the Storybook Dads production unit

at Channings Wood Prison in Devon
Channings Wood
And that's where I worked

I was trained along with other prisoners

to edit and produce recordings sent in

from prisons all over the United Kingdom

Using audio and video software

the recordings have the mistakes taken out

and sound effects and music added in

And the experience and skill which the prison editors gain

helps them in their future employment

Once the recording is finalized

it's transferred to a CD or a DVD and sent out to the families
CDDVD
so that the children can watch them whenever they feel the need

And they listen to these recordings and watch them a lot 

at bedtime in the car 

Some even take them to school to show their friends

These recordings

they show the children that they're loved and missed

And they show the prisoner

that they can do something for their child as a parent

Do you remember Sophie

Well one day just before Christmas a parcel arrived

and this is what was in it

Let's listen to a little of it together

Video Santa On Comet On Cupid On Donner and Blitzen
  
Charlie That's his reindeer isn't it

Santa It is his reindeer yeah

Up up higher and higher they flew

across land across oceans they sped

Through the magical northern lights they passed 

I'd love to see the northern lights wouldn't you

Charlie I figure they'd probably look a bit like that snowman's belly

Santa They probably would yeah

That's a cool snowman isn't it

Charlie It's very cool indeed I love it

Santa They visited all the children in the world

and left presents for each and every one

In the blink of an eye they were back in Frogsbottom Field

Charlie Laughs

Santa You think that's well funny

Charlie I want to live in Frogsbottom Field

Santa Where do you live in Frogsbottom Tree

Charlie I don't I live in this tree

I've made it all Christmasylook

Santa It's nice that

You've done a good job good job

Charlie Thank you very much

Laughter

Alan Crickmore Sophie and her mum listened to that three times

and they haven't laughed so much in a long time

They can see that he's all right they can see that he loves them

and the next time he rings Sophie's got plenty to talk about

What does Charlie the Chimp eat

Will daddy do another story very soon

Since it began in  Storybook Dads has grown and grown

It now operates as Storybook Dads and Storybook Mums

in more than  prisons in the United Kingdom

Ninetyeight percent of the prisoners who take part

say that it's improved their relationship with their child

And since 

over  DVDs and CDs have been sent out
DVDCD
to the children of prisoners

For Sophie's family and for thousands of families like them

Storybook Dads has been a lifeline

Some prisoners say that it's the first time

that they've begun to build a relationship with their child

And some poor readers have been so inspired

by what they've been able to achieve

that they've gone to education classes to improve their own reading skills

Let's go back to the story of The Ugly Duckling

But this time I'd like to play you a recording made by a prisoner

because it encapsulates the power of what we do

The prisoner was an Irish Traveller who couldn't read

And he wanted to send a story home to his daughter for her birthday

With the help of a mentor and some clever editing

something magical happened

This is an extract from the raw recording

where the prisoner is reading the story by repeating it phrase at a time

Audio Mentor He had nowhere to hide

Owen He had nowhere to hide

Mentor So one day he ran away

Owen Then one day he ran away

Mentor He ran until he came to the great marsh

Owen He run until he come to the great marsh

Mentor Where the wild ducks lived

Owen Where the wild ducks lived

AC And this is a recording  an excerpt of the recording
AC
with the mentor's voice taken out and sound effects and music added in

Audio Owen He had nowhere to hide

Then one day he run away

He run until he come to the great marsh where the wild ducks lived

and he laid in the rushes for two weeks

Music Ducks quack

Some wild ducks and geese come to look at him

You're very ugly they said and they laughed at him

Ducks quack

The ugly duckling ran away from the great marsh

Duck quacks

AC And this is how he finished the story
AC
Audio Owen He wasn't an ugly duckling at all

During the winter he had grown into a beautiful white swan

The other swans looked at him and thought how beautiful he was

Come with us they said

And he did

Bird sounds

Well Tiara I hope you have enjoyed this story

as much as I enjoyed reading this story to you

I cannot wait to be with you again and hold you in my arms

All my love your daddy Owen

Lots of love I miss you with all my heart

Goodbye for now my love Bye bye

Music

Music ends

AC When he listened to that recording in his cell

before it was sent out to his daughter

he cried

And that's a pretty common reaction from prisoners

as they realize for the first time

they've been able to do something for their child

which they never thought they could

They've connected in the most fundamental way

through the medium of storytelling

And as for Sophie

she wants The Gruffalo next time

Laughter

Applause

I am guilty of stacking my dishes in the sink

and leaving them there for hours

I factchecked this with my boyfriend

He says it's less like hours and more like days

but that's not the point

The point is sometimes I don't finish the job

until the stack has gotten high enough that it's peaking over the lip of the sink

and my inner clean freak loses it

This charming habit developed when I was in college

and I had tons of excuses

I'm running to class

What's one more dirty dish in the sink

Or my favorite I think I can save time and water

if I do them all together later

Laughter

But it's not like I needed those excuses because nobody was calling me on it

I wish they had

I look back now

and realize that every time I didn't put a dish in the dishwasher

and finish what I started

it became more second nature to me

and I grew less likely to question why I was doing it

Today I'm a something certified dirtydish leaver

and breaking this habit is hard

So when I'm not at home avoiding the sink

I work with large complex organizations on leadership transformation

in times of change

My job is to work with the most senior leaders

to examine how they lead today

and establish habits better suited for the future

But what interests me more than senior leaders these days

is what's going on with the junior ones

We call them middle managers

but it's a term I wish we could change

because what they are is our pipeline of future talent for the Csuite
C
and they are starting to leave their dishes in the sink

While organizations are hiring people like me

to redevelop their senior leaders for the future

outdated leadership habits are forming right before our eyes

among the middle managers who will one day take their place

We need middle managers and senior leaders to work together

because this is a big problem

Organizations are evolving rapidly

and they're counting on their future leaders

to lead with more speed flexibility trust and cooperation than they do today

I believe there is a window of time in the formative middlemanager years

when we can lay the groundwork for that kind of leadership

but we're missing it

Why

Because our future leaders are learning from senior role models

who just aren't ready to role model yet

much less change the systems that made them so successful

We need middle managers and senior leaders to work together

to define a new way of leading

and develop each other to rise to the occasion

One of my favorite senior clients 

we'll call her Jane 

is a poster child for what's oldfashioned in leadership today

She rose to her Clevel position
C
based on exceptional individual performance

Come hell or high water Jane got the job done

and today she leads like it

She is tough to please

she doesn't have a lot of time for things that's aren't missioncritical

and she really doesn't trust anyone's judgment more than her own

Needless to say Jane's in behavior boot camp

Those deeply ingrained habits

are deeply inconsistent with where her organization is heading

The commandandcontrol behavior that she was once rewarded for

just isn't going to work

in a fastermoving flatter more digitally interconnected organization

What got her here won't get her there

But I want to talk about John

a supertalented upandcoming manager who works for Jane

because her habits are rubbing off on him

Recently he and I were strategizing

about a decision we needed to put in front of the CEO Jane's boss

and the rest of Jane's peers

He said to me Liz you're not going to like this

but the way decisions get made around here

is with a bunch of meetings before the meeting

I counted

That was going to mean eight oneonones exec by exec

to make sure each one of them was individually on board enough

that things would go smoothly in the actual meeting

He promised It's not how we'll do things in the future

but it's how we have to do them today

John wasn't wrong on either count

Meetings before the meeting are a necessary evil

in his company today

and I didn't like it at all

Sure it was going to be inefficient and annoying

but what bothered me most was his confidence

that it's not how they'll do things in the future

How could he be sure

Who was going to change it and when if it wasn't him and now

What would the trigger be

And when it happened

would he even know how to have effective meetings without premeetings

He was confidently implying that when he's the boss

he'll change the rules and do things differently

but all I could see were dishes stacking in the sink

and a guy with a lot of good excuses

Worse a guy who might be out of a job one day

because he learned too late how to lead

in the organizations of tomorrow

These stories really get to me

when it's the fasttrack highpotential managers like John

because they're probably the most capable of making waves

and redefining how leaders lead from the inside

But what we find is that they're often doing the best job at not rocking the boat

and challenging the system

because they're trying to impress

and make life easier on the senior leaders who will promote them

As someone who also likes to get promoted

I can hardly blame him

It's a catch

But they're also so selfassured

that they'll be able to change their behavior

once they've earned the authority to do things differently

and that is a trap

Because if I've learned anything from working with Jane

it's that when that day comes

John will wonder how he could possibly do anything differently

in his highstakes highpressure executive job

without risking his own success and the organization's

and he'll wish it didn't feel so safe and so easy

to keep doing things the way they've always been done

So the leadership development expert in me asks

How can we better intervene in the formative years

of our soontobe senior leaders

How can we use the fact that John and his peers want to take charge

of their professional destinies

and get them ready to lead the organizations of the future

rather than let them succumb to the catch

that will perfectly prepare them to lead the organizations of the past

We'll have to start by coming to terms with a very real paradox

which is this

the best form of learning happens on the job 

not in a classroom not via emodules

And the two things we rely on to shape onthejob learning

are role models and work environments

And as we just talked about

our role models are in behavior boot camp right now

and our work environments are undergoing unprecedented disruption

We are systematically changing just about everything

about how organizations work

but by and large still measuring and rewarding behavior

based on old metrics

because changing those systems takes time

So if we can't fully count on role models or the system right now

it's on John to not miss this critical development window

Yes he'll need Jane's help to do it

but the responsibility is his because the risks are actually his

Either he inherits an organization that is failing

because of stubbornly oldfashioned leadership

or he himself fails to build the capabilities to lead one

that transformed while he was playing it safe

So now the question is where does John start

If I were John I'd ask to start flying the plane

For my th birthday my grandpa a former Navy pilot

gave me the gift of being able to fly a very small plane

Once we were safely airborne

the pilot turned over the controls folded his hands

and he let me fly

It was totally terrifying

It was exhilarating but it was also onthejob learning with a safety net

And because it was real

I really learned how to do it myself

Likewise in the workplace every meeting to be led

every decision to be made

can be a practice flight

for someone who could really use the learning experience

and the chance to figure out how to do it their own way

So instead of caving John needs to knock on Jane's door

propose a creative strategy

for having the meeting without the eight premeetings

show her he's thought through the tradeoffs

and ask for her support to do it differently

This isn't going to be easy for Jane

Not only does she need to trust John

she needs to accept that with a little bit of room to try his hand at leading

John will inevitably start leading in some ways

that are far more John than Jane

And this won't be an indictment of her

Rather it will be individualism

It will be progress

And it might even be a chance for Jane to learn a thing or two

to take her own leadership game to the next level

I work with another senior client who summed up this dilemma beautifully

when we were talking about why he and his peers

haven't empowered the folks below them with more decision rights

He said

We haven't done it because we just don't trust

that they're going to make the right decisions

But then again how could they

We've just never given them decisions to practice with

So I'm not advocating that Jane hands over the controls

and folds her hands indefinitely

but what I am saying

is that if she doesn't engineer learning and practice

right into John's day today

he'll never be able to do what she does

much less do it any differently than she does it

Finally since we're going to be pushing both of them outside their comfort zones

we need some outside coaches

to make sure this isn't a case of the blind leading the blind

But what if instead of using coaches

to coach each one of them to individually be more effective

we started coaching the interactions between them

If I could wave my magic wand

I would have coaches sitting in the occasional team meeting

of Jane and her direct reports

debriefing solely on how well they cooperated that day

I would put a coach in the periodic feedback session between Jane and John

and just like a couples' therapist coaches on communication

they would offer advice and observations

on how that conversation can go better in the future

Was Jane simply reinforcing what Jane would have done

Or was Jane really helping John

think through what to do for the organization

That is seriously hard mentorship to provide

and even the best leaders need help doing it

which is why we need more coaches coaching more leaders

more in real time

versus any one leader behind closed doors

Around  years ago Warren Buffet gave a school lecture

in which he said The chains of habit are too light to be felt

until they're too heavy to be broken

I couldn't agree more

and I see it happening with our future leaders in training

Can we and they be doing more to build their leadership capabilities

while they're still open eager

and not too far gone down a path of bad habits we totally saw coming

I wish my college roommates and I called each other out back then

for the dishes

It would have been so much easier to nip that habit in the bud

than it is to change it today

But I still believe in a future for myself full of gleaming sinks

and busy dishwashers

and so we're working on it

every day together moment to moment

one dirty dish at a time

Thank you

Applause

It was the spring of 

when I had the aha moment
aha
I was at my first roundtable

and for those of you who don't know

the roundtable was a very commonly used phrase on Wall Street

to describe the yearend evaluative process

for analysts associates vice presidents all the way up to managing directors

That was the process where they were discussed behind closed doors

around a table ie the round table
 
and everyone was put into a category 

the top bucket the middle bucket the lower bucket 

and then that was translated into a bonus range

that would be assigned to each professional

This was my first time there and as I observed

I saw that there was one person that was responsible

for recording the outcome of a conversation

There were other people in the room that had the responsibility

of presenting the cases of all the candidates

And there were other invited guests who were supposed to comment

as a candidate's position was presented

It was interesting to me that those other people

were folks who were more senior than the folks that were being discussed

and they theoretically had had some interaction with those candidates

Now I was really excited to be at this roundtable for the first time

because I knew that my own process would go through this same way

and that my bonus would be decided in the same way

so I wanted to know how it worked

but more importantly

I wanted to understand how this concept of a meritocracy

that every company that I talked to walking out of business school

was selling

Every time I talked to a company

they would say Our culture our process is a meritocracy

The way you get ahead in this organization is that you're smart

you put your head down and you work really hard

and you'll go right to the top

So here was my opportunity to see exactly how that worked

So as the process began

I heard the recorder call the first person's name

Joe Smith

The person responsible for presenting Joe's case did just that

Three quarters of the way through someone interrupted and said

This is a great candidate outstanding

has great analytical and quantitative skills

This is a superstar

The recorder then said

Sounds like Joe should go in the top bucket

Second person Mary Smith

Halfway through that presentation someone said Solid candidate

Nothing really special but a good pair of hands

The recorder said

Sounds like Mary should go in the middle bucket

And then someone said Arnold Smith

Before the person could present Arnold's case

somebody said Disaster Disaster This kid doesn't have a clue

Can't do a model

And before the case was presented

the recorder said

Sounds like Arnold should go in the bottom bucket

It was at that moment that I clutched my pearls 

Laughter

and said Who is going to speak for me

Who is going to speak for me

It was that moment that I realized that this idea of a meritocracy

that every organizations sells is really just a myth

You cannot have a  percent meritocratic environment

when there is a human element involved in the evaluative equation

because by definition

that makes it subjective

I knew at that moment that somebody would have to be behind closed doors

arguing on my behalf

presenting content in such a way

that other decision makers around that table

would answer in my best favor

That was a really interesting lesson

and then I said to myself Well who is that person

What do you call this person

And as I thought about the popular business terms at the time

I said wow this person can't be a mentor

because a mentor's job is to give you tailored advice

tailored specifically to you and to your career aspirations

They're the ones who give you the good the bad and the ugly

in a noholdsbarred way

OK Person can't be a champion or an advocate

because you don't necessarily have to spend any currency

to be someone's champion

You don't necessarily get invited to the room

behind closed doors if you're an advocate

It was almost two years later

when I realized what this person should be called

I was speaking at the University of Michigan

to the MBA candidates
MBA
talking about the lessons that I had learned

after my three short years on Wall Street

and then it came to me

I said Oh this person that is carrying your interest

or as I like to say carrying your paper into the room

this person who is spending

their valuable political and social capital on you

this person who is going to pound the table on your behalf

this is a sponsor

This is a sponsor

And then I said to myself

Well how do you get a sponsor

And frankly why do you need one

Well you need a sponsor frankly

because as you can see

there's not one evaluative process that I can think of

whether it's in academia health care financial services

not one that does not have a human element

So that means it has that measure of subjectivity

There is a measure of subjectivity in who is presenting your case

There is a measure of subjectivity

in what they say

and how they interpret any objective data that you might have

There is a measure of subjectivity in how they say what they're going to say

to influence the outcome

So therefore you need to make sure that that person who is speaking

that sponsor

has your best interests at heart

and has the power to get it whatever it is for you

to get it done behind closed doors

Now I'm asked all the time

How do you get one

Well frankly nirvana is when someone sees you in an environment

and decides I'm going to make it happen for you

I'm going to make sure that you are successful

But for many of us in this room we know it doesn't really happen that way

So let me introduce this concept of currency

and talk to you about how it impacts your ability to get a sponsor

There are two types of currency in any environment

performance currency and relationship currency

And performance currency is the currency that is generated

by your delivering that which was asked of you

and a little bit extra

Every time you deliver upon an assignment above people's expectations

you generate performance currency

It works exactly like the stock market

Any time a company says to the street

that they will deliver  cents a share

and that company delivers  cents a share

that stock goes up and so will yours

Performance currency is valuable for three reasons

Number one it will get you noticed

It will create a reputation for you

Number two it will also get you paid and promoted

very early on in your career

and very early on in any environment

And number three it may attract a sponsor

Why Because strong performance currency
 
raises your level of visibility in the environment as I said earlier

such that a sponsor may be attracted to you

Why Because everybody loves a star
 
But if you find yourself in a situation

where you don't have a sponsor

here's the good news

Remember that you can exercise your power and ask for one

But here's where the other currency is now most important

That is the relationship currency

and relationship currency is the currency that is generated

by the investments that you make in the people in your environment

the investments that you make in the people in your environment

You cannot ask someone to use their hardearned

personal influential currency on your behalf

if you've never had any interaction with them

It is not going to happen

So it is important that you invest the time to connect to engage

and to get to know the people that are in your environment

and more importantly to give them the opportunity to know you

Because once they know you

there's a higher probability that when you approach them

to ask them to be your sponsor

they will in fact answer in the affirmative

Now if you're with me and you agree that you have to have a sponsor

let's talk about how you identify a sponsor

Well if you're looking for a sponsor

they need to have three primary characteristics

Number one they need to have a seat at the decisionmaking table

they need to have exposure to your work

in order to have credibility behind closed doors

and they need to have some juice

or let me say it differently they'd better have some power

It's really important that they have those three things

And then once you have identified the person

how do you ask for one

The script goes like this

Jim I'm really interested in getting promoted this year

I've had an amazing year

and I cannot show this organization anything else to prove my worthiness

or my readiness for this promotion

but I am aware that somebody has to be behind closed doors

arguing on my behalf and pounding the table

You know me you know my work and you are aware of the client feedback

and I hope that you will feel comfortable arguing on my behalf

If Jim knows you

and you have any kind of a relationship

there's a very high probability that he will answer yes

and if he says yes

he will endeavor to get it done for you

But there's also a shot that Jim might say no

and if he says no in my opinion

there's only three reasons that he would tell you no

The first is he doesn't think that he has enough exposure to your work

to have real credibility behind closed doors

to be impactful and effective on your behalf

The second reason he may tell you no

is that you think he has the juice to get it done

but he knows that he does not have the power to do it

and he is not going to admit that in that conversation with you

Laughter

And the third reason that he would tell you no

he doesn't like you

He doesn't like you

Laughter

And that's something that could happen

But even that will be valuable information for you

that will help to inform your next conversation with a sponsor

that might make it a little bit more impactful

I cannot tell you how important it is to have a sponsor

It is the critical relationship in your career

A mentor frankly is a nice to have

but you can survive a long time in your career without a mentor

but you are not going to ascend in any organization without a sponsor

It is so critical that you should ask yourself regularly

Who's carrying my paper into the room

Who is carrying my paper into the room

And if you can't answer who is carrying your paper into the room

then I will tell you to divert some of your hardworking energies

into investing in a sponsor relationship

because it will be critical to your success

And as I close let me give a word

to the wouldbe sponsors that are in the room

If you have been invited into the room

know that you have a seat at that table

and if you have a seat at the table

you have a responsibility to speak

Don't waste your power worrying about what people are going to say

and whether or not they think you might be supporting someone

just because they look like you

If somebody is worthy of your currency

spend it

One thing I have learned after several decades on Wall Street

is the way to grow your power is to give it away

and your voice is at the heart

Applause

And your voice is at the heart of your power

Use it

Thank you very much

Applause

I want to start out with quoting Helen Keller

that great woman that we all admire

And she had a statement that is very profound

and this statement is

that science has been able to find cures for many evils

but never the greatest evil of all in human beings

and that evil is apathy

So we know that apathy really costs us a lot

especially in our democracy

And when we think of why people do not get involved

why they do not become activists

it's often that people are so worn down with their own familial responsibilities

and women especially

You know women they have so many inhibitions

Many of them have suffered so much trauma in their lives

so many aggressions in their lives

And so it's very hard for them to realize that they have leadership capacities

That they can get out there and they could change the world

Another thing that many women 

we think that we have to do everything

That we are the only ones responsible for our families

and it is so hard for us to delegate

and just get others to help us do the duties that we are responsible for

We feel embarrassed or we feel guilty

But we know that we have to make this happen

because if not we will never have time to be able to volunteer

to help on these many causes that are now facing us

One of the areas that women can give up a little bit of time

and that is in shopping OK

Laughter

And especially when we go out there

shopping for things that we don't even need

Laughter

You know you never saw a hearse with a UHaul behind it
UHaul
Laughter

We have to live simply so that others can simply live

And when we think of the kind of inheritance

that we want to leave to our children or our grandchildren

think of leaving them a legacy of justice

This is a legacy that they can not only imitate

but they can be proud of for the rest of their lives

If we leave them a lot of material goods all they're going to do is fight

and they're going to hate each other

Just remember that when we think about what we're doing

The other thing that we have to do to liberate our women eventually

so that we can do the kind of volunteer work that we need to do

to change this world

is we have to have a different kind of an education for our young women

Unfortunately in our societies around the world

women are taught to be victims

Women are not taught that they are going to have to defend themselves

that they're going to have to support themselves

and they have to protect themselves

Because you know when we actually look at the animal kingdom

and we see who are the most ferocious the male or the female

We know it's the female right

So something went wrong with us at the top of that animal kingdom as women

Laughter

So I want to give you an example of how I found my voice

And I was very fortunate in that when I was  years old

I met a gentleman named Fred Ross Sr

who organized a chapter of a group called the Community Service Organization

in my hometown of Stockton California

This was a grassroots organization and I was recruited to be a volunteer

So one day while we were sitting in the office

a farm worker comes in

And he's paralyzed he can hardly walk he has a crutch

And he needs help

He needs someone to help him go down to the welfare office

and make an application

So I volunteered to do that

But when I got to the welfare office

they would not let me make an application for this gentleman

So I didn't know what to do I was at a loss

So I went back to the office and I told Mr Ross

They won't let me make an application

And he said to me very sternly

You go right back down to that welfare office

and you demand to see a supervisor

And you demand that they let him make an application

And I thought Wow I can do that

Laughter

So I thought about it

and I kind of overcame my anxieties and my fears

I went down to the welfare office and I demanded to see the supervisor

Sure enough he came out

and they had to let Mr Ruiz make an application for welfare

And he got his disability for himself and his family

But that taught me a lesson

That taught me that I had a voice

Well Mr Ross also taught many of us many other things including Cesar Chavez

and many other volunteers

And he taught us not only that we can make demands of people

especially our public officials

And this is something we should always keep in mind

every public official  guess what  they work for us

Because we pay their salaries with out taxes

And they are actually our servants

Some of them turn out to be leaders but not all of them

Laughter

Once in a while we get a leader out of there

The other thing that Mr Ross taught us is that voting is extremely important

And not just voting

but going out there and getting other people to vote

Going door to door

Phone banking talking to voters

because many voters have a lot of doubts and they don't know how to vote

And unfortunately

we know that in many countries people are not allowed to vote

because we have voter suppression in other countries

like we do here in the United States of America

But the thing is if we can get out there as individuals

and talk to people so we can remove their apathy

and make sure that they can vote

So I want to give you an example of a woman in our foundation

the Dolores Huerta Foundation

and just to show you that sometimes people have power

but they don't know it

But once they find it they do miraculous things

So Leticia Prado is an immigrant from Mexico
Leticia Prado
only has a sixthgrade education

and speaks very limited English

But she was very concerned

because the children at the middle school in their town called Weedpatch 
Weedpatch
this is in California Central Valley 

they couldn't go out and play in the schoolyard

because the air quality is so bad

in the southern part of Kern County California

in our United States of America

So she and her husband went out there and they passed a bond issue

to build a brand new stateoftheart gymnasium

for the kids at their middle school

That was a big success

Then she heard a rumor

that the principal was going to end the breakfast program

for the farm worker children

because the principal thought it was just too much paperwork

So Leticia got herself elected to the school board

And they kept the breakfast program and she got rid of the principal

Laughter

Applause

So there were other rumors

about some corruption in the local water district

So Leticia got herself elected to the water district

Then she looked into all of the finances of the water district

and found there was  dollars missing from their bank account

So Leticia called in the grand jury and several arrests have been made

And this is just an example of a woman who never went to high school

never went to college

but she found her power

And in addition she has recruited other people in the community

to also run for public office

and guess what  they've all gotten themselves elected

So I take that Leticia really embodies

something that Coretta Scott King said

And I want to share this with you Coretta Scott King said

We will never have peace in the world until women take power

Applause

Now I have amended that statement to say

that we will never have peace in the world until feminists take power

Laughter

Because we know there is a difference right

Not only that but if we want to define what is a feminist 

a person who stands up for reproductive rights

for immigrants' rights for the environment

for LGBT rights and also for labor unions and working people
LGBT
Applause

Which also means that men can also be feminists

Applause

So when we think of feminization

we should also think of how can we feminize the policies

and not only of our major countries

the wealthy countries like the United States

but all over the world

our domestic and foreign policy

And one of the things that we can do to stop wars and to have peace

is to make sure that the wealthiest countries in the world

also help the developing countries

Now we did this in the past

After World War II

when Japan and Germany were devastated after the war

United States of America gave many tax dollars to those two countries

so that they can rebuild their economies and rebuild their corporations

And we can do that again

And if we can think about how we can help these other countries

And I want to give an example

of issues that we are facing in the United States of America

for instance

We know that right now

we have a lot of refugees from Central America

that are at the border of the United States

Why do people leave their homes

their beautiful homes that we go to as tourists

Because they don't have opportunities there

And then we think Hm bananas

How many jillions of bananas do we consume in the United States every single day

And throughout the world

Now do the people in Central America

get the profits from the bananas that we consume

No they don't

The profits go to corporations from the United States of America

And we think that this is wrong

Now if the people in Central America were to be able to get some of that money

that we pay for bananas

then they wouldn't have to leave their homes

They wouldn't have to come as asylum seekers

to the borders of the United States of America

And then maybe many children would not have to be separated from their parents

Now we know that there are countries in the world

that actually have free education and have free health care

for all of the people in their country

And that country is Cuba

Cuba has health care for every one of their citizens

and they have a free college education for every one of their citizens

They're  million citizens

Now we think if a poor country like Cuba

can have these kind of resources and we know that they're a poor country

then why can't some of the other wealthier countries

like the United States of America

do the same

I think that we can make that happen

Applause

But we know it's not going to happen

until we the people of the United States of America

and people throughout the world

start making sure that they get public officials elected to their governments

that really care about the constituents they care about people

they will commit to make sure that the resources that they have

are going to be used for their citizens and not to be used for war

So how do we make this happen

We have to get rid of the apathy

we have to get more people involved

We know that if we can't have a democracy in the United States

we can't have democracies throughout the world

unless people participate

So it is imperative that all of us get out there and we say

Get rid of the apathy get off of the sidewalk

come and join the march for peace and justice

let's make Coretta Scott's vision a reality

to have peace in the world

We recently had midterm elections in the United States of America

And what did we see

We saw that so many more women

young people people of color LGBT folks

were all elected to public office

And we know this happened  why

Because so many women were on the march

We had the Women's March in the United States

They had the Women's Marches all over the world

And so we now see that we have this potential

We have this potential to get rid of the apathy

And if we get everyone involved get everyone committed

then I think we can make Coretta Scott's vision come true

So I want to just remind everybody

throughout the world one of the things is

we have power

poor people have power

every citizen has power

But in order to achieve the peace that we all yearn for

then we've all got to get involved

So what do we say

Can we do it

We say Yes we can

And in Spanish we say S se puede
Sise puede
Thank you very much

I want to share with you

a moment in my life

when the hurt and wounds of racism

were both deadly and paralyzing for me

And I think what I've learned

can be a source of healing for all of us

When I was  years old

I was a college student at Tuskegee University

and I was a worker in the Southern freedom movement

which we call the Civil Rights Movement

During this time

I met another young yearold

white seminary and college student

named Jonathan Daniels from Cambridge Massachusetts

He and I

were both part of a generation of idealistic young people

whose life has been ignited

by the freedom fire

that ordinary black people were spreading around the nation

and throughout the South

We had come to Lowndes County

to work in the movement

And it was a nonviolent movement

to redeem the souls of America

We believe that everyone

both black and white

people in the South

could find a redemptive pathway

out of the stranglehold of racism

that had gripped them for more than  years

And on a hot summer day in August

Jonathan and I joined a demonstration

of local young black people

who were protesting the exploitation

[of] black sharecroppers
[]
by rich land holders who cheated them out of their money

We decided to demonstrate alongside them

And on the morning that we showed up for the demonstration

we were met with a mob of howling white men

with baseball bats shotguns

and any weapon that you could imagine

And they were threatening to kill us

And the sheriff seeing the danger that we faced

arrested us and put us on a garbage truck

and took us to the local jail

where we were put in cells

with the most inhumane conditions you can imagine

And we were threatened by the jailers

with drinking water that came from toilets

We were finally released on the sixth day

without any knowledge without any forewarning

Just out of the clear blue sky

we were made to leave

And we knew that this was a dangerous sign

because Goodman Schwerner and Chaney had also been forced to leave jail

and were murdered because no one knew what had happened to them

And so despite our fervent resistance

the sheriff made us leave the jail

and of course nobody was waiting for us

It was hot

one of those Southern days

where you could literally feel the pavement 

the vapor seeping out of the pavement

And the group of about  of us

selected Jonathan Daniels

Father Morrisroe who had recently come to the county
Morrisroe
Joyce Bailey a local yearold girl

and I to go and get the drinks

When we got to the door

a white man was standing in the doorway with a shotgun

and he said Bitch I'll blow your brains out

And before I could even react

before I could even process what was going on

Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse

and I fell back thinking that I was dead

And in that instant when I looked up

Jonathan Daniels was standing in the line of fire

and he took the blast

and he saved my life

I was so traumatized

and paralyzed by that event

where Tom Coleman deliberately

with malicious intent

killed my beloved friend and colleague

Jonathan Myrick Daniels

On that day

which was one of the most important days in my life

I saw both love and hate

coming from two very different white men

that represented the best and the worst of white America

So deep was my hurt

at seeing Tom Coleman murder Jonathan before my eyes

that I became a silent person

and I did not speak

for six months

I finally learned to touch that hurt in me

as I became older

and began to talk about the Southern freedom movement

and began to connect my stories

with the stories of my other colleagues and freedom fighters

who like me had faced deadly trauma of racism

and who had lost friends along the way

and who themselves have been beaten and thrown in jail

It is  years later

Many people were beaten and thrown in jail

Others were murdered like Jonathan Daniels

And yet we are still as a nation

mired down

in the quicksand of racism

And everywhere I go around the nation

I see and hear the hurt

And I ask people everywhere

Tell me where does it hurt

Do you see and feel the hurt

that I see and feel

I feel and see the hurt in black and brown people

who every day feel the vicious volley of racism

and every day have their civil and human rights stripped away

And the people who do this use stereotypes and myths

to justify doing it

Everywhere I go

I see and hear women

who speak out against 

who speak out against men who invade our bodies

These same men who then turn around 

the same men who promote racism

and then turn around and steal our labor and pay us unequal wages

I hear and feel the hurt of white men

at the betrayal by the same powerful white men

who tell them that their skin color

is their ticket to a good life and power

only to discover

as the circle of whiteness narrows

that their tickets have expired

and no longer carry firstclass status

Now that we've touched the hurt

we must ask ourselves

Where does it hurt

and what is the source of the hurt

I propose that we must look

deeply into the culture of whiteness

That is a river that drowns out all of our identities

and drowns us in false uniformity to protect the status quo

Notice everybody I said culture of whiteness

and not white people

Because in my estimation

the problem is not white people

Instead it is the culture of whiteness

And by culture of whiteness

I mean a systemic and organized set of beliefs

values canonized knowledge and even religion

to maintain a hierarchical overandagainst power structure

based on skin color against people of color

It is a culture

where white people are seen as necessary and friendly insiders

while people of color especially black people

are seen as dangerous

and threatening outsiders

who pose a clear and present danger

to the safety and the efficacy

of the culture of whiteness

Listen to me and see if you can imagine

the culture of whiteness as a dehumanizing process

that melts away

all of our multiple and interlocking identities

such as race class gender and sexualities

so that 

so that unity is maintained for power

I believe because I know

and believe that the culture of whiteness

is a social construct

Each of us from birth to death

are socialized in this culture

And it marks people of color also

And it makes people of color like white people

vote against our interests

Some of you might ask 

and my students always tell me I give hard assignments 

some of you might ask and rightfully so

How do we fix this

It seems so allpowerful and overwhelming

I believe that we must fix it

because we cannot humanize our future

if we continue to be complicit

with the culture of whiteness

Each of us must connect with our authentic selves

with our authentic ethnic selves

And we must connect with the other aspects of our identities

And we must move out of the constructs

of whiteness brownness and blackness

to become who we are at our fullest

How do we do this

I believe that we do this through our collective narratives

And our collective narratives must contain our individual stories

the arts

spiritual reflections

literature

and yes even drumming

Laughter

It must be a collective telling

because individual stories just create a paradigm

where we are pitting one story against another story

These different models that I have talked about tonight

I think are essential to providing us a pathway

out of the quagmire of racism

And I want to talk about another very important model

And that is redemption

I believe that movements for racial justice

must be redemptive rather than punitive

And yes I believe

that we must provide the possibility of redemption for everyone

And we must be willing

despite some of the vitriolic language

that might come from those very people who oppress us

I think that we must listen to them

and try to figure out where do they hurt

We must do this I believe

because our redemption is tied into their redemption

And we will not be free

until we've all been redeemed from unredemptive anger

The challenge is not easy

And in a technological society it grows even more complicated

because often we use technologies

to perpetuate the very values of racism that we indulge in every day

We use technology to bully

to perpetuate hate speech

and to degrade each other's humanities

And so I believe that if we're going to humanize the future

we must design ways to use technology

not to degrade us but to elevate us

so that we can live into the fullest of our capacities

And I believe that technology

must provide us larger vistas

so that we might engage with each other

and move beyond the segregated spaces that we live in every day of our lives

I believe

that we can achieve this if we set our minds

and hopes on the prize

The question before us tonight

is very serious

It is Do you want to be healed

Do you want to be healed

Do you want to become whole and live into all of your identities

Or do you want to continue to cannibalize your multiple identities

and privilege one identity over the other

Do you want to join a long line

of generations of people

who believed in the promise of America

and had the faith to upbuild democracy

Do you want to live into the fullest of your potential

I certainly do

And I believe you do too

Let me just say quite seriously

I believe in you

And despite everything

I still believe in America

I hope that this offering that I've given to you tonight

that I've shared with you tonight

will provide redemptive pathways

so that you might claim the fullest of your identity

and become a major participant

in humanizing not only the future for yourselves

but also for our democracy

Thank you

Applause

I'm here to tell you

how change is happening at a local level in Pakistan

because women are finding their place in the political process

I want to take you all on a journey to the place I was raised

northwest Pakistan called Dir

Dir was founded in the th century
DIR
It was a princely state until its merger with Pakistan in 

Our prince Nawab Shah Jahan reserved the right to wear white
Nawab Shah Jahan
the color of honor but only for himself

He didn't believe in educating his people

And at the time of my birth in 

only five percent of boys and one percent of girls

received any schooling at all

I was one among that one percent

Growing up I was very close to my father

He is a pharmacy doctor and he sent me to school

Every day I would go to his clinic when my lessons finished

He's a wonderful man and a wellrespected community leader

He was leading a welfare organization

and I would go with him to the social and political gatherings

to listen and talk to the local men about our social and economic problems

However when I was 

my father asked me to stop coming with him to the public gatherings

Now I was a young woman and my place was in the home

I was very upset

But most of my family members they were happy with this decision

It was very difficult for me

to sit back in the home and not be involved

It took two years

that finally my family agreed that my father could reconnect me

with women and girls

so they could share their problems and together we could resolve them

So with his blessings

I started to reconnect with women and girls

so we could resolve their problems together

When women show up

they bring their realities and views with them

And yet I have found all too often

women underestimate their own strength

their potential and their selfrespect

However while connecting with these women and girls

it became very clear to me

that if there was to be any hope to create a better life

for these women and girls and their families

we must stand up for our own rights 

and not wait for someone else to come and help us

So I took a huge leap of faith

and founded my own organization in '

to create our very own platform for women empowerment

I engaged many women and girls to work with me

It was hard

Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married

because their husbands wouldn't let them work

One colleague of mine was given away by her family

to make amends for a crime her brother had committed

I couldn't help her

And I felt so helpless at that time

But it made me more determined to continue my struggle

I saw many practices like these

where these women suffered silently bearing this brutality

But when I see a woman

struggling to change her situation instead of giving up

it motivates me

So I ran for a public office

as an independent candidate in Lower Dir

in the local elections in 

Despite all the challenges and hurdles I faced throughout this process I won

Applause

And I served in the public office for six years

But unfortunately

we women elected women

we were not allowed to sit in the council together with all the members

and to take part in the proceedings

We had to sit in a separate ladiesonly room

not even aware what was happening in the council

Men told me

that You women elected women members

should buy sewing machines for women

When I knew what they needed the most was access to clean drinking water

So I did everything I could do

to prioritize the real challenges these women faced

I set up five hand pumps in the two dried up wells in my locality

Well we got them working again

Before long we made water accessible for over  families

We proved that anything the men could do

so could we women

I built alliances with other elected women members

and last year

we women were allowed to sit together with all the members in the council

Applause

And to take part in the legislation and planning and budgeting

in all the decisions

I saw there is strength in numbers

You know yourselves

Lack of representation means no one is fighting for you

Pakistan is 

We're  miles away from where I'm here with you today

But I hope what I'm about to tell you will resonate with you

though we have this big distance in miles and in our cultures

When women show up

they bring the realities and hopes of half a population with them

In  we saw the rise of the Taliban

in Swat Dir and nearby districts

It was horrifying

The Taliban killed innocent people

Almost every day

people collected the dead bodies of their loved ones from the streets

Most of the social and political leaders

struggling and working for the betterment of their communities

were threatened and targeted

Even I had to leave

leaving my children behind with my inlaws

I closed my office in Dir and relocated to Peshawar

the capital of my province

I was in trauma kept thinking what to do next

And most of the family members and friends

were suggesting Shad stop working

The threat is very serious

But I persisted

In  we experienced a historic influx of internally displaced persons

from Swat Dir and other nearby districts

I started visiting the camps almost every day

until the internally displaced persons

started to go back to their place of origin

I established four motherchild health care units

especially to take care of over  women and children

nearby the camps

But you know during all these visits

I observed that there was very little attention towards women's needs

And I was looking for what is the reason behind it

And I found it was because of the underrepresentation of women

in both social and political platforms in our society as a whole

And that was the time when I realized

that I need to narrow down my focus

on building and strengthening women's political leadership

to increase their political representation

so they would have their own voice in their future

So we started training around  potential women and youth

for the upcoming local elections in 

And you know what

Fifty percent of them won

Applause

And they are now sitting in the councils

taking part actively in the legislation planning and budgeting

Most of them are now investing their funds

on women's health education skill development and safe drinking water

All these elected women now

share discuss and resolve their problems together

Let me tell you about two of the women I have been working with

Saira Shams

You can see this young lady age 

she ran for a public office in  in Lower Dir and she won

She completed two of the community infrastructure schemes

You know women community infrastructure schemes 

Some people think this is men's job

But no this is women's job too we can do it

And she also fixed two of the roads leading towards girls schools

knowing that without access to these schools

they are useless to the girls of Dir

And another young woman is Asma Gul
Asma Gul
She is a very active member of the young leaders forum we established

She was unable to run for the public office

so she has become the first female journalist of our region

She speaks and writes for women's and girls' issues and their rights

Saira and Asma they are the living examples

of the importance of inclusion and representation

Let me tell you this too

In the  general elections in Pakistan

and the local elections in 

there were less than  women voters in Dir

But you know what

I'm proud to tell you that this year during the general elections

there were  women voters in Dir
 
Applause

So our struggle is far from over

But this shift is historic

And a sign that women are standing up showing up and making it absolutely clear

that we all must invest in building women's leadership

In Pakistan and here in the United States

and everywhere in the world

this means women in politics women in business

and women in positions of power making important decisions

It took me  years to get here

But I don't want any girl or any woman

to take  years of her life to make herself heard

I have had some dark days

But I have spent every waking moment of my life

working for the right of every woman to live her full potential

Imagine with me a world

where thousands of us stand up

and they support other young women together

creating opportunities and choices that benefit all

And that my friends can change the world

Thank you

Applause

Pollinator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world

Of the  species of pollinators

honeybees are the most wellunderstood

partly because of our long history with them dating back  years ago

to our cave drawings in what is now modernday Spain

And yet we know that this indicator species is dying off

Last year alone we lost  percent of all beehives in the United States

That number is even higher in areas with harsh winters

like here in Massachusetts

where we lost  percent of beehives

in one year alone

Can you imagine if we lost half of our people last year

And if those were the foodproducing people

It's untenable

And I predict that in  years

we will lose our bees

If not for the work of beekeepers replacing these dead beehives

we would be without foods that we rely upon

fruits vegetables

crunchy almonds and nuts

tart apples

sour lemons

Even the food that our cattle rely upon to eat hay and alfalfa  gone

causing global hunger

economic collapse

a total moral crisis across earth

Now I first started keeping bees here in Cape Cod

right after I finished my doctorate in honeybee immunology

Laughter

Applause

Imagine getting such a degree in a good economy 

and it was 

the Great Recession

And I was onto something

I knew that I could find out how to improve bee health

And so the community on Cape Cod here in Provincetown

was ripe for citizen science

people looking for ways to get involved and to help

And so we met with people in coffee shops

A wonderful woman named Natalie got eight beehives at her home in Truro

and she introduced us to her friend Valerie

who let us set up  beehives at an abandoned tennis court on her property

And so we started testing vaccines for bees

We were starting to look at probiotics

We called it bee yogurt 

ways to make bees healthier

And our citizen science project started to take off

Meanwhile back in my apartment here

I was a bit nervous about my landlord

I figured I should tell him what we were doing

Laughter

I was terrified I really thought I was going to get an eviction notice
 
which really was the last thing we needed right

I must have caught him on a good day though

because when I told him what we were doing

and how we started our nonprofit urban beekeeping laboratory

he said That's great Let's get a beehive in the back alley
 
I was shocked

I was completely surprised

I mean instead of getting an eviction notice

we got another data point

And in the back alley of this image

what you see here this hidden beehive 

that beehive produced more honey that first year

than we have ever experienced in any beehive we had managed

It shifted our research perspective forever

It changed our research question away from How do we save the dead and dying bees

to Where are bees doing best

And we started to be able to put maps together

looking at all of these citizen science beehives

from people who had beehives at home decks

gardens business rooftops

We started to engage the public

and the more people who got these little data points

the more accurate our maps became

And so when you're sitting here thinking How can I get involved

you might think about a story of my friend Fred

who's a commercial real estate developer

He was thinking the same thing

He was at a meeting

thinking about what he could do for tenant relations

and sustainability at scale

And while he was having a tea break

he put honey into his tea and noticed on the honey jar

a message about corporate sustainability from the host company of that meeting

And it sparked an idea

He came back to his office

An email a phone call later and  boom 
 
we went national together

We put dozens of beehives on the rooftops of their skyscrapers

across nine cities nationwide

Nine years later 

Applause

Nine years later we have raised over a million dollars for bee research

We have a thousand beehives as little data points across the country

 states and counting

where we have created paying jobs for local beekeepers  of them

to manage beehives in their own communities

to connect with people everyday people

who are now data points together making a difference

So in order to explain what's actually been saving bees

where they're thriving

I need to first tell you what's been killing them

The top three killers of bees

are agricultural chemicals such as pesticides herbicides fungicides

diseases of bees of which there are many

and habitat loss

So what we did is we looked on our maps

and we identified areas where bees were thriving

This was mostly in cities we found

Data are now showing that urban beehives produce more honey

than rural beehives and suburban beehives

Urban beehives have a longer life span than rural and suburban beehives

and bees in the city are more biodiverse

there are more bee species in urban areas

Laughter

Right

Why is this

That was our question

So we started with these three killers of bees

and we flipped it

Which of these is different in the cities

So the first one pesticides

We partnered up with the Harvard School of Public Health

We shared our data with them

We collected samples from our citizen science beehives

at people's homes and business rooftops

We looked at pesticide levels

We thought there would be less pesticides in areas where bees are doing better

That's not the case

So what we found here in our study is  the orange bars are Boston

and we thought those bars would be the lowest

there would be the lowest levels of pesticides

And in fact there are the most pesticides in cities

So the pesticide hypothesis for what's saving bees 

less pesticides in cities 

is not it

And this is very typical of my life as a scientist

Anytime I've had a hypothesis

not only is it not supported but the opposite is true

Laughter

Which is still an interesting finding right

We moved on

The disease hypothesis

We looked at diseases all over our beehives

And what we found in a similar study to this one with North Carolina State is

there's no difference between disease in bees

in urban suburban and rural areas

Diseases are everywhere bees are sick and dying
 
In fact there were more diseases of bees in cities

This was from Raleigh North Carolina

So again my hypothesis was not supported The opposite was true

We're moving on

Laughter

The habitat hypothesis

This said that areas where bees are thriving have a better habitat 

more flowers right

But we didn't know how to test this

So I had a really interesting meeting

An idea sparked with my friend and colleague Anne Madden

fellow TED speaker
TED
We thought about genomics kind of like AncestryDNA or andMe
cancestrydnaandMe
Have you done these

You spit in a tube and you find out I'm German

Laughter

Well we developed this for honey

So we have a sample of honey and we look at all the plant DNA
DNA
and we find out I'm sumac

Laughter

And that's what we found here in Provincetown

So for the first time ever I'm able to report to you

what type of honey is from right here in our own community

HoneyDNA a genomics test
HoneyDNA
Spring honey in Provincetown is from privet

What's privet Hedges
 
What's the message

Don't trim your hedges to save the bees

Laughter

I know we're getting crunchy and it's controversial

so before you throw your tomatoes

we'll move to the summer honey which is water lily honey

If you have honey from Provincetown right here in the summer

you're eating water lily juice

in the fall sumac honey

We're learning about our food for the first time ever

And now we're able to report if you need to do any city planning

What are good things to plant

What do we know the bees are going to that's good for your garden

For the first time ever for any community we now know this answer

What's more interesting for us is deeper in the data

So if you're from the Caribbean and you want to explore your heritage

Bahamian honey is from the laurel family

cinnamon and avocado flavors

But what's more interesting is  different plant species

in one teaspoon of honey

That's the measure we want the big data

Indian honey that is oak

Every sample we've tested from India is oak

and that's  different flavors in one taste of Indian honey

Provincetown honey goes from  plants in the spring

to over  plants in the summer

These are the numbers that we need to test the habitat hypothesis

In another citizen science approach

you find out about your food and we get some interesting data

We're finding out now that in rural areas

there are  plants on average in a sample of honey

That's a measure for rural

Suburban areas what might you think

Do they have less or more plants in suburban areas with lawns

that look nice for people but they're terrible for pollinators

Suburbs have very low plant diversity

so if you have a beautiful lawn

good for you but you can do more

You can have a patch of your lawn that's a wildflower meadow

to diversify your habitat

to improve pollinator health

Anybody can do this

Urban areas have the most habitat best habitat

as you can see here over  different plants

We have for the first time ever support for the habitat hypothesis

We also now know how we can work with cities

The City of Boston has eight times better habitat

than its nearby suburbs

And so when we work with governments we can scale this

You might think on my tombstone it'll say

Here lies Noah Plant a flower Right
 
I mean  it's exhausting after all of this

But when we scale together

when we go to governments and city planners 

like in Boston the honey is mostly linden trees

and we say If a dead tree needs to be replaced consider linden

When we take this information to governments we can do amazing things

This is a rooftop from Fred's company

We can plant those things on top of rooftops worldwide

to start restoring habitat and securing food systems

We've worked with the World Bank

and the presidential delegation from the country of Haiti

We've worked with wonderful graduate students at Yale University and Ethiopia

In these countries we can add value to their honey

by identifying what it is

but informing the people of what to plant

to restore their habitat and secure their food systems

But what I think is even more important is when we think about natural disasters

For the first time

we now know how we can have a baseline measure of any habitat

before it might be destroyed

Think about your hometown

What risks does the environment pose to it

This is how we're going to save Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria

We now have a baseline measure of honey

honey DNA from before and after the storm
DNA
We started in Humacao

This is right where Hurricane Maria made landfall

And we know what plants to replace and in what quantity and where

by triangulating honey DNA samples
DNA
You might even think about right here

the beautiful land that connected us that primed us

all the citizen science to begin with

the erosion the winter storms

that are getting more violent every year

What are we going to do about this

our precious land

Well looking at honey DNA
DNA
we can see what plants are good for pollinators that have deep roots

that can secure the land

and together everybody can participate

And the solution fits in a teaspoon

If your hometown might get swept away or destroyed by a natural disaster

we now have a blueprint suspended in time

for how to restore that on Earth

or perhaps even in a greenhouse on Mars

I know it sounds crazy but think about this

a new Provincetown

a new hometown

a place that might be familiar that's also good for pollinators

for a stable food system

when we're thinking about the future

Now together we know what's saving bees 

by planting diverse habitat

Now together we know how bees are going to save us 

by being barometers for environmental health

by being blueprints sources of information

little data factories suspended in time

Thank you

Applause

For the past  years I have been a firefighter

in Huntington West Virginia

As firefighters my team and I are tasked with saving lives

and property

from such disasters as car wrecks house fires

and also lifethreatening medical emergencies

I am a woman leading a department in a maledominated profession

And  years ago

I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree

That was because it became clear

that the next big threat facing not only my city

but other cities around the country

was not the oneanddone disaster

where you can ride in like the cavalry as a firefighter

put out the fire and leave feeling like you have made a difference

and everything is OK

The next big disaster in my city was and is the long debilitating

and lethal disaster known as opioid addiction

We now call this a health epidemic

and we have replaced the name addiction with substance use disorder

To give you some perspective

of how significant this epidemic has become

in  in my county of  people

we saw  overdoses

[and]  deaths from overdose
[]
This is the job of my firefighters as well as other agencies

to respond to that

Coughs

Excuse me

So watching this epidemic unfold for several years

I developed some insight

For this disaster we need to redefine our job as a first responder

We need to be more than just the cavalry

We need to do more than just save a life

We need to find ways to rebuild that life

And it's going to take a lot of people to do that

And that is exactly what we are trying to do

in Huntington West Virginia

Now let me give you some insight as to what we do

First this is what happens when somebody overdoses

Imagine you are somebody who is suffering from the brain disorder of addiction

You are fragile

You're embarrassed you're ashamed

And you overdose

Maybe a friend or a family member calls 

And then all of a sudden

you are awakened by five or six total strangers in uniform

And they're rubbing your sternum

and they're saying Wake up wake up

You overdosed you could've died

Now would you not be defensive and angry

Because I know I would be

And on top of that

those strangers gave you a dose of naloxone

which has sent you into withdrawals

or what is better known as dope sickness

Dope sickness makes you feel absolutely horrible

Some say it's like the flu times ten

Nausea vomiting diarrhea body aches

So not only did we as strangers wake you up

but we also made you feel really sick

So in turn you the patient are not going to be very kind to us

And you're going to refuse further medical treatment

OK well then that's going to frustrate the heck out of us

and we're going to be mad

because you're ungrateful that we just saved your life

This is not a good dynamic here

What we are dealing with is a brain disorder

that changes your thinking

It convinces you that you don't have a problem

So this might have been not only the first time you've overdosed

it might have been the third fourth or fifth time

that we personally have revived you

This is not a good situation

Second

first responders do not receive much education

on what substance use disorder is

Neither does the medical community

We're not trained how to deal with those suffering from substance use disorder

I am trained to put out many different types of fires

I am trained to save a life in the moment

But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction

between first responders the health care community

social services

and the wider community that is necessary to save a life longterm

Thirdly

and this hits home

As a first responder I consider myself the cavalry

We're knights in shining armor

We want to swoop in do our job and leave feeling satisfied

that we've made a difference in somebody's life

But that just doesn't happen

when we're dealing with somebody with substance use disorder

We leave feeling frustrated and useless

We deal with the same people over and over again

with no positive outcome

And you know what

At some point I realized that it is up to us as first responders

and as a community

to solve this problem

to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering

So what I did is I started observing more on overdoses

I started talking and listening to my patients

I wanted to know what led them to where they are

What exactly are they experiencing

What makes their situation worse

What makes their situation better

I began experimenting with my words

and paying attention to my own actions

and how it affected those of my patients

The education that I have received

and continue to receive on a street level in Huntington

has been both eyeopening and lifechanging for me

So in Huntington West Virginia we have come together as a community

and we are changing the way that we treat

those that suffer from this horrible disease

We have started many programs and it's making a difference

I'll tell you about just a few of those

Last year we started a Quick Response Team

QRT for short
qRT
The team consists of a paramedic

a police officer

somebody in the recovery community and somebody in the faith community

As a team they go out and visit people who have overdosed

within  hours of that resuscitation

They talk

They listen

They build a rapport with that patient

and they offer them treatment options

Right now about  percent or up to  percent

of those that the Quick Response Team have reached out to

have accepted some form of help

And the wonderful thing about this

is the first responders who are involved in this team

they actually feel like they can make a difference

Positive change where there wasn't any

This year 

Applause

This year we opened a freestanding specialty clinic called PROACT
PROACT
for those suffering from substance use disorder

It's a onestop shop if you will

A patient comes in

they're immediately assessed by somebody who's an addiction specialist

They work with them to provide treatment options

based on their own needs individual needs

This does several things for us

It gives first responders a place to either take or refer our patients

who are no longer in a lifethreatening situation

that have refused to go to the hospital

And it also clears up

the overwhelmed emergency rooms in hospitals that we have

The third thing that I want to tell you about

is very dear to me and very important to my team

We recently started a first responders selfcare program

More and more 

first responders are experiencing compassion fatigue and PTSD
PTSD
It is not uncommon for the average firefighter in Huntington

to deal with or see up to five young deaths per month

These are their friends these are their classmates

So this muchneeded program will not only recognize their hard work

it's going to give them a voice

It's going to provide them with training

that will help deal with the stress that they are under

And it will give them more mentalhealth options

that they desperately need

We now have yoga classes in fire stations

Laughter

Applause

We've also provided onduty massages which is fabulous

Laughter

And we have some offduty programs that we've started

like cooking classes for first responders and their significant other

and pottery classes

So a couple of months ago

I walked out on the apparatus floor where I had some firefighters

And half of them had had a massage

and the other half were getting ready to have a massage

And I saw  firefighters who were bantering

in a very positive relaxed manner

And I hadn't seen that in years

And that relaxed state is trickling down to the community to the citizens

So a couple of weeks ago I had a neighbor overdose

Twentytwo years old

So of course I hurried down to help my firefighters and my neighbor

And what I witnessed was my firefighters being supportive

Talking in a nonjudgmental way

I watched as one of my firefighters

showed the father and another family member

how to provide rescue breaths should this happen again

And left him with a bag valve mask

Positive change

Positive change

Did I happen to mention

the two things that firefighters dislike the most

The way things are and change

Laughter

You know I recognize that there have been drug epidemics before

And I've seen what crack can do to a community
crack
A lot of our critics think

that this new compassionate response that we're doing in Huntington

is because of race

That because the overdoses are happening so much to the white community

And I understand that criticism

because we as a country messed up

And we treated black people poorly during the crack epidemic

We can't forget that

And we must do better

But right now what I know is people are dying

And we in Huntington deal with people suffering from substance use disorder

of every color and every background on the streets every day

The job of a first responder prevent unnecessary deaths

Period

So 

Obviously I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse

And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier

One of the barriers that we have

dealing with the opioid epidemic is stigma

So 

We in Huntington West Virginia are showing the rest of the country

that change can happen

That there is hope dealing with this epidemic

Our current overdoses are down  percent

Applause

Currently our overdose deaths are down  percent

Applause

This epidemic is far from over

But each and every one of us has a part to play in this epidemic

Just by listening and being kind to somebody

you have the ability to make a difference in their lives

Thank you and God bless

Applause

A few weeks ago

somebody tweeted during the midterm elections in the United States

that Election Day should be made a holiday

And I retweeted saying

Well you're welcome to come to my country and vote

You'll get the whole week off to allow the military to count it

I come from Togo by the way

It is a beautiful country located in West Africa

There are some cool interesting facts about my country

Togo has been ruled by the same family for  years

making us the oldest autocracy in Africa

That's a record

We have a secondcoolest record

we have been ranked three times as the unhappiest country on earth

You are all invited

Laughter

So just to let you know

it's not very cool to live under an autocracy

But the interesting thing is that I have met throughout the course of my activism

so many people from different countries

and when I tell them about Togo their reaction is always

How can you guys allow the same people to terrorize you for  years

You know like you Togolese you must be very patient

That's their diplomatic way of saying stupid

Laughter

And when you live in a free country

there's this tendency of assuming that those who are oppressed

tolerate their oppression or are comfortable with it

and democracy is projected as a progressive form of governance

in such a way that those people who don't live under democratic countries

are seen as people who are not intellectually or maybe morally

as advanced as others

But it's not the case

The reason why people have that perception

has to do with the way stories are covered about dictatorships

In the course of my activism

I have had to interview with so many news outlets out there

and usually it would always start with What got you started

What inspired you

And I reply I wasn't inspired I was triggered

And it goes on Well what triggered you
 
And I go on about how my father was arrested when I was  and tortured

all the history  I don't want to get into details now
 
because you'll start sleeping

But the thing is at the end of the day what interests them the most is

How was he tortured

For how many days How many people died
 
They are interested in the abuse in the killing

because they believe that will gain attention and sympathy

But in reality it serves the purpose of the dictator

It helps them advertise their cruelty

In  I cofounded a movement I call Faure Must Go
Fure must go
because Faure is the first name of our president

Togo is a Frenchspeaking country by the way

but I chose English because I had my issues with France as well

But then 

Laughter

But then when I started Faure Must Go

I made a video and I came on camera

and I said Well Faure Gnassingb I give you  days to resign as president

because if you don't

we the youth in Togo will organize and we will bring you down

because you have killed over  of our countrymen

to seize power when your father died

We have not chosen you

You are an imposter and we will remove you

But I was the only known face of the movement

Why Because I was the only stupid one
 
Laughter

And the backlashes followed

My family started receiving threats

My siblings called me one morning

They said You know what

When they come here to kill you we don't want to die with you

so move out

So yes I moved out

And I'm so angry at them so I haven't talked to them in five years

Anyway moving forward 

For the past nine years I have been working with countries

to raise awareness of Togo

to help the people of Togo overcome their fear

so they too can come and say they want change

I have received a lot of persecution

that I cannot disclose

a lot of threats a lot of abuse

psychologically

But I don't like talking about them

because I know that my job as an activist is to mobilize

is to organize

is to help every single Togolese citizen understand that as citizens

we hold the power

we are the boss and we decide

And the punishment that the dictators are using to intimidate them

must not prevent us from getting what we want

That is why I said it is very important to cover the stories of activists

in the way that it helps mobilize people

not in the way that it helps deter their action

and force even more their subjugation to the oppressive system

During these years that I've been an activist

there are days that I felt like quitting because I couldn't take it

Well then what kept me going

The one thing that kept me going

I remember the story of my grandfather

and how he used to walk  miles from his village to the city

just to protest for independence

Then I remember the sacrifice of my father

who was tortured so many times

for daring to protest against the regime

Back in the 's they would write pamphlets

to raise awareness on the dictatorship

and because they couldn't afford to make copies

they would reproduce the same pamphlet  times each

and distribute them

It got to a point where the military knew their handwriting

so as soon as they stumbled upon one they'd go and get them

But I look at that and I'm like you know today you have a blog

I don't have to copy the same thing  times

I blog and thousands of people read it

By the way in Togo they like calling me the WhatsApp girl
WhatsApp
because I am always on WhatsApp attacking the government
WhatsApp
Laughter

So it's much easier

When I'm angry at the government I just make an angry note

and I send it out and thousands of people share it

I'm rarely this composed I'm always angry by the way

Laughter

Applause

So I was talking about the necessity to showcase our stories

because when I think about the sacrifices that were made for us

it helped me keep going

One of the very first actions of our Faure Must Go movement

was to come up with a petition asking citizens to sign

so that we can demand new elections as the constitution allows

People were scared to put their names

because they said they don't want to get in trouble

Even in the diaspora people were scared

They were like We have family at home

But there was this woman who was in her s

When she heard about it she took the petition

and she went home

and by herself she collected over  [signatures]

That inspired me so much and I was like

if a yearold that has nothing more to gain in this regime

can do this for us the young ones

then why should I quit

It is the stories of resistance the stories of defiance

the stories of resilience

that inspire people to get involved

not the stories of abuse and killings and hurt

because as humans it's only natural for us to be scared

I would like to share with you a few characteristics of dictatorships

so that you can assess your own country

and see if you are also at risk of joining us

Laughter and cheers

Applause

Number one thing to look at concentration of power

Is the power in your country concentrated in the hands of a few an elite

It can be a political elite ideological elite

And you have a strongman

because we always have one guy who is presented as the messiah

who will save us from the world

The second point is propaganda

Dictators feed on propaganda

They like giving the impression that they are the saviors

and without them the country will fall apart

And they are always fighting some foreign forces you know

The Christians the Jewish the Muslims

the voodoo priests are coming for you

The Communists when they get here we'll all be broke

These kinds of things

And our president in particular he fights pirates

Laughter

I am very serious

Last year he bought a boat that's  million dollars to fight pirates

and  percent of our people are starving

So they are always protecting us from some foreign forces

And this leads to point three militarization

Dictators survive by instigating fear

and they use the military to suppress dissident voices

even though they try to give the impression

that the military is to protect the nation

And they suppress institutions and destroy them

so that they don't have to be held accountable

So do you have a heavily militarized country

And this leads to point four what I call human cruelty

You know when we talk about animals

we say animal cruelty when animals are abused

because there's no charter acknowledged by the UN

saying animal rights charter

Point one all animals are created equal So you don't have that

So whenever animals are abused we say animal cruelty

But when it comes to humans we say human rights abuses

because we assume that all humans have rights

But some of us are actually still fighting for our right to have rights

So in that condition I don't talk about human rights abuse or violation

When you live in a country and you have an issue with the president

and the worst thing that can happen is he bans you from the presidency

you are lucky

When you come to my country and have an issue with the president

you just run disappear you vanish from the universe
 
because they can still find you in Turkey

So people like myself we don't get to live in Togo anymore

And people like myself

we don't get to live in the same place for more than a month

because we don't want to be traced

The way they abuse people

the type of cruelty that happens in all impunity under dictatorships

are beyond human imagination

The stories of some of the activists that were killed

their bodies dumped in the sea

that were tortured

to the point where they lost their hearing or their sight 

those stories still haunt me

And sometimes as an activist

I am less concerned about dying than how it will happen

Sometimes I just sit down and I imagine all scenarios

What are they going to do Are they going to cut my ears first
 
Or are they going to cut my tongue because I'm always insulting them

It sounds cruel but it is the reality

We live in a very cruel world

Dictators are cruel monsters

and I am not saying it to be nice

So yes that is the final characteristic

The list goes on

but that's the final thing that I want to share about autocracies

so that you look at your country and see if there are risks there

It is important that you acknowledge the gains of freedom that you have today

because some people had to give their lives for you to have it

So don't take this for granted

But then at the same time you also need to know

that no country is actually destined to be oppressed

while at the same time

no country or no people are immune to oppression and dictatorship

Thank you

Applause

So let me with start with Roy Amara

Roy's argument is that most new technologies tend to be overestimated

in their impact to begin with

and then they get underestimated in the long term

because we get used to them

These really are days of miracle and wonder

You remember that wonderful song by Paul Simon

There were two lines in it

So what was it that was considered miraculous back then

Slowing down things  slow motion 

and the longdistance call

Because of course you used to get interrupted by operators

who'd tell you Long distance calling Do you want to hang up

And now we think nothing of calling all over the world

Well something similar may be happening

with reading and programming life

But before I unpack that

let's just talk about telescopes

Telescopes were overestimated originally in their impact

This is one of Galileo's early models

People thought it was just going to ruin all religion

Laughter

So we're not paying that much attention to telescopes

But of course telescopes launched  years ago as you just heard

could take this Volkswagen fly it to the moon

and you could see the lights on that Volkswagen light up on the moon

And that's the kind of resolution power that allowed you to see

little specks of dust floating around distant suns

Imagine for a second that this was a sun a billion light years away

and you had a little speck of dust that came in front of it

That's what detecting an exoplanet is like

And the cool thing is the telescopes that are now being launched

would allow you to see a single candle lit on the moon

And if you separated it by one plate

you could see two candles separately at that distance

And that's the kind of resolution that you need

to begin to image that little speck of dust

as it comes around the sun

and see if it has a bluegreen signature

And if it does have a bluegreen signature

it means that life is common in the universe

The first time you ever see a bluegreen signature on a distant planet

it means there's photosynthesis there

there's water there

and the chances that you saw the only other planet with photosynthesis

are about zero

And that's a calendarchanging event

There's a before and after we were alone in the universe

forget about the discovery of whatever continent

So as you're thinking about this

we're now beginning to be able to image most of the universe

And that is a time of miracle and wonder

And we kind of take that for granted

Something similar is happening in life

So we're hearing about life in these little bits and pieces

We hear about CRISPR and we hear about this technology
CRISPR
and we hear about this technology

But the bottom line on life is that life turns out to be code

And life as code is a really important concept because it means

just in the same way as you can write a sentence

in English or in French or Chinese

just in the same way as you can copy a sentence

just in the same way as you can edit a sentence

just in the same way as you can print a sentence

you're beginning to be able to do that with life

It means that we're beginning to learn how to read this language

And this of course is the language that is used by this orange

So how does this orange execute code

It doesn't do it in ones and zeroes like a computer does

It sits on a tree and one day it does

plop

And that means execute

AATCAAG make me a little root
AATCAAG
TCGACC make me a little stem
TCGACC
GAC make me some leaves AGC make me some flowers
GAC AGC
And then GCAA make me some more oranges
GCAA
If I edit a sentence in English on a word processor

then what happens is you can go from this word to that word

If I edit something in this orange

and put in GCAAC using CRISPR or something else that you've heard of
GCAACCRISPR
then this orange becomes a lemon

or it becomes a grapefruit

or it becomes a tangerine

And if I edit one in a thousand letters

you become the person sitting next to you today

Be more careful where you sit

Laughter

What's happening on this stuff is it was really expensive to begin with

It was like longdistance calls

But the cost of this is dropping  percent faster than Moore's law

The first  full genome was announced yesterday by Veritas
Veritas
And so as you're looking at these systems

it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter and then it does

So let me just give you the map view of this stuff

This is a big discovery

There's  chromosomes

Cool

Let's now start using a telescope version but instead of using a telescope

let's use a microscope to zoom in

on the inferior of those chromosomes

which is the Y chromosome
Y
It's a third the size of the X It's recessive and mutant
X
But hey

just a male

And as you're looking at this stuff

here's kind of a country view

at a  base pair resolution level

and then you zoom in to  and then you zoom in to 

and you can begin to identify more and more genes as you zoom in

Then you zoom in to the state level

and you can begin to tell who's got leukemia

how did they get leukemia what kind of leukemia do they have

what shifted from what place to what place

And then you zoom in to the Google street view level
Google
So this is what happens if you have colorectal cancer

for a very specific patient on the letterbyletter resolution

So what we're doing in this stuff is we're gathering information

and just generating enormous amounts of information

This is one of the largest databases on the planet

and it's growing faster than we can build computers to store it

You can create some incredible maps with this stuff

You want to understand the plague and why one plague is bubonic

and the other one is a different kind of plague

and the other one is a different kind of plague

Well here's a map of the plague

Some are absolutely deadly to humans

some are not

And note by the way as you go to the bottom of this

how does it compare to tuberculosis

So this is the difference between tuberculosis and various kinds of plagues

and you can play detective with this stuff

because you can take a very specific kind of cholera

that affected Haiti

and you can look at which country it came from

which region it came from

and probably which soldier took that from that African country to Haiti

Zoom out

It's not just zooming in

This is one of the coolest maps ever done by human beings

What they've done is taken all the genetic information they have

about all the species

and they've put a tree of life on a single page

that you can zoom in and out of

So this is what came first how did it diversify how did it branch

how large is that genome

on a single page

It's kind of the universe of life on Earth

and it's being constantly updated and completed

And so as you're looking at this stuff

the really important change is the old biology used to be reactive

You used to have a lot of biologists that had microscopes

and they had magnifying glasses and they were out observing animals

The new biology is proactive

You don't just observe stuff you make stuff

And that's a really big change

because it allows us to do things like this

And I know you're really excited by this picture

Laughter

It only took us four years and  million dollars

to be able to take this picture

Laughter

And what we did

is we took the full gene code out of a cell 

not a gene not two genes the full gene code out of a cell 

built a completely new gene code

inserted it into the cell

figured out a way to have the cell execute that code

and built a completely new species

So this is the world's first synthetic life form

And so what do you do with this stuff

Well this stuff is going to change the world

Let me give you three shortterm trends

in terms of how it's going to change the world

The first is we're going to see a new industrial revolution

And I actually mean that literally

So in the same way as Switzerland and Germany and Britain

changed the world with machines like the one you see in this lobby

created power 

in the same way CERN is changing the world
CERN
using new instruments and our concept of the universe 

programmable life forms are also going to change the world

because once you can program cells

in the same way as you program your computer chip

then you can make almost anything

So your computer chip can produce photographs

can produce music can produce film

can produce love letters can produce spreadsheets

It's just ones and zeroes flying through there

If you can flow ATCGs through cells
ATCG
then this software makes its own hardware

which means it scales very quickly

No matter what happens

if you leave your cell phone by your bedside

you will not have a billion cell phones in the morning

But if you do that with living organisms

you can make this stuff at a very large scale

One of the things you can do is you can start producing

close to carbonneutral fuels

on a commercial scale by 

which we're doing with Exxon

But you can also substitute for agricultural lands

Instead of having  hectares to make oils or to make proteins

you can make it in these vats

at  or  times the productivity per hectare

Or you can store information or you can make all the world's vaccines

in those three vats

Or you can store most of the information that's held at CERN in those three vats
CERN
DNA is a really powerful information storage device
DNA
Second turn

you're beginning to see the rise of theoretical biology

So medical school departments are one of the most conservative places on earth

The way they teach anatomy is similar to the way they taught anatomy

 years ago

Welcome student Here's your cadaver

One of the things medical schools are not good at is creating new departments

which is why this is so unusual

Isaac Kohane has now created a department based on informatics data knowledge
Isaac Kohane
at Harvard Medical School

And in a sense what's beginning to happen is

biology is beginning to get enough data

that it can begin to follow the steps of physics

which used to be observational physics

and experimental physicists

and then started creating theoretical biology

Well that's what you're beginning to see

because you have so many medical records

because you have so much data about people

you've got their genomes you've got their viromes

you've got their microbiomes

And as this information stacks

you can begin to make predictions

The third thing that's happening is this is coming to the consumer

So you too can get your genes sequenced

And this is beginning to create companies like andMe
andMe
and companies like andMe are going to be giving you
andMe
more and more and more data

not just about your relatives

but about you and your body

and it's going to compare stuff

and it's going to compare stuff across time

and these are going to become very large databases

But it's also beginning to affect a series of other businesses

in unexpected ways

Normally when you advertise something you really don't want the consumer

to take your advertisement into the bathroom to pee on

Unless of course if you're IKEA

Because when you rip this out of a magazine and you pee on it

it'll turn blue if you're pregnant

Laughter

And they'll give you a discount on your crib

Laughter

Right So when I say consumer empowerment
 
and this is spreading beyond biotech

I actually really mean that

We're now beginning to produce at Synthetic Genomics

desktop printers

that allow you to design a cell

print a cell

execute the program on the cell

We can now print vaccines

real time as an airplane takes off

before it lands

We're shipping  of these machines this year

This is not theoretical biology This is printing biology

Let me talk about two longterm trends

that are coming at you over a longer time period

The first one is we're starting to redesign species

And you've heard about that right

We're redesigning trees We're redesigning flowers

We're redesigning yogurt

cheese whatever else you want

And that of course brings up the interesting question

How and when should we redesign humans

And a lot of us think Oh no we never want to redesign humans

Unless of course if your child has a Huntington's gene

and is condemned to death

Or unless if you're passing on a cystic fibrosis gene

in which case you don't just want to redesign yourself

you want to redesign your children and their children

And these are complicated debates and they're going to happen in real time

I'll give you one current example

One of the debates going on at the National Academies today

is you have the power to put a gene drive into mosquitoes

so that you will kill all the malariacarrying mosquitoes

Now some people say

That's going to affect the environment in an extreme way don't do it

Other people say

This is one of the things that's killing millions of people yearly

Who are you to tell me that I can't save the kids in my country

And why is this debate so complicated

Because as soon as you let this loose in Brazil

or in Southern Florida 

mosquitoes don't respect walls

You're making a decision for the world

when you put a gene drive into the air

This wonderful man won a Nobel Prize

and after winning the Nobel Prize

he's been worrying about

how did life get started on this planet

and how likely is it that it's in other places

So what he's been doing is going around to this graduate students

and saying to his graduate students

Build me life but don't use any modern chemicals or instruments

Build me stuff that was here three billion years ago

You can't use lasers You can't use this You can't use that

He gave me a vial of what he's built about three weeks ago

What has he built

He's built basically what looked like soap bubbles that are made out of lipids

He's built a precursor of RNA
RNA
He's had the precursor of the RNA be absorbed by the cell
RNA
and then he's had the cells divide

We may not be that far 

call it a decade maybe two decades 

from generating life from scratch

out of protocommunities

Second longterm trend

we've been living and are living through the digital age 

we're starting to live through the age of the genome

and biology and CRISPR and synthetic biology 
CRISPR
and all of that is going to merge into the age of the brain

So we're getting to the point where we can rebuild most of our body parts

in the same way as if you break a bone or burn your skin it regrows

We're beginning to learn how to regrow our tracheas

or how to regrow our bladders

Both of those have been implanted in humans

Tony Atala is working on  different organs

But the core is going to be this

because this is you and the rest is just packaging

Nobody's going to live beyond    years

unless if we fix this

And that's the most interesting challenge

That's the next frontier along with

How common is life in the universe

Where did we come from

and questions like that

Let me end this with an apocryphal quote from Einstein

[You can live as if everything is a miracle
[
or you can live as if nothing is a miracle]

It's your choice

You can focus on the bad you can focus on the scary

and certainly there's a lot of scary out there

But use  percent of your brain to focus on that or maybe  percent

or maybe  percent

But just remember

we really are living in an age of miracle and wonder

We're lucky to be alive today We're lucky to see this stuff

We're lucky to be able to interact with folks like the folks

who are building all the stuff in this room

So thank you to all of you for all you do

Applause

Last summer I was hiking through the Austrian mountains

And there on top I saw this beautiful stone remote hut

and it had solar panels on it

And every time I see solar panels I get very enthusiastic

It's this technology that takes sunlight which is free and available

and turns that into electricity

So this hut in the middle of nowhere on a beautiful location

was selfsufficient

But why do solar panels always have to be so ugly

Laughter

My name is Marjan Van Aubel and I'm a solar designer
Marjan Van Aubel
I work in the triangle of design sustainability and technology

I strive for extreme efficiency

meaning that I develop materials that expand in size

or work with solar cells that use the properties of colors

to generate electricity

My work is in museums all over the world such as MoMA
MoMA
And I mean it all went quite well

but it always felt that something was missing

And it was until I read the book called the Solar Revolution

where it says that within one hour we receive enough sunlight

to provide the world with enough electricity

for an entire year

One hour

And since then I realized I just want to focus on solar

Scientists all over the world

have been focusing on making solar panels more efficient and cheaper

So the price of solar has dropped enormously

And this is because China started producing them on a large scale

And also their efficiency has increased a lot

They now even have an efficiency of  percent

But if you think about the image of solar cells

it's kind of stayed the same for the last  years

It's still this technology just stacked onto something

And solar cells need to be much better integrated into our environment

Climate change is the biggest problem of our time

And we can't rely on the others  the government the engineers 

to make positive changes

We all can contribute towards change

Like I said I'm a designer

and I would like to change things through design

Let me give you some examples of my work

I'm collaborating with Swarovski the crystal company

And if you cut crystals in a certain way

you are able to bend and direct the light onto a certain place

So I use these crystals to focus the light onto a solar panel

making them more efficient but using aesthetics

So you take the solar crystal with you in the light

there's a battery in the solar cell

you put it in a docking station

and you are able to power these chandeliers

So you're literally bringing the light indoors

I got completely hooked on solar when I came across this technology

called dyesensitized solar cells

colored solar cells

and they are based on photosynthesis in plants

Where the green chlorophyl converts light into sugar for plants

these cells convert light into electricity

The best thing is they even work indoors

So different colors have different efficiency

depending on their place on the color spectrum

So for example red is more efficient than blue

So if I hear this as a designer

a colored surface a glass colored surface

color that's mostly just used for esthetics

now gets an extra function and is able to harvest electricity

I think where can we apply this then

This is Current Table

where the whole tabletop consists of these colored solar cells

There are batteries in the legs

where you can charge your phone through USB ports
USB
And in my work it's always very important

the balance between efficiency and aesthetics

So that's why the table is orange

because it is a very stable color for indoors

And this is always the most asked question I get

OK great but how many phones can I charge from this then

And before I go to this complicated answer of like

Well where is the table does it have enough light

is it next to a window

The table now has sensors that read the light intensity of the room

So through an app we developed

you can literally follow how much light it's getting

and how full the battery is

I'm actually proud because yesterday we installed a table

at Stichting Doen's offices in Amsterdam
Stichting Doen
and right at this moment

our Queen Maxima is charging a phone from this table

It's cool

Applause

So the more surface you have the more energy you can harvest

These are Current Windows
Windows
where we replaced all windows in a gallery in London in Soho
Soho
with this modern version of stained glass

So people from the street could come and charge their phones

through the window ledges

So I'm giving extra functions to objects

A window doesn't have to be just a window anymore

It can also function as a little power station

So here I am talking about how much I love solar

but I don't have solar panels on my roof

I live in the center of Amsterdam

I don't own the house and it's a monument

so it's not possible and not allowed

So how can you make solar cells more accessible and for everyone

and not only for the people that can afford a sustainable lifestyle

We now have the opportunity

to integrate solar on the place where we directly need it

And there are so many amazing technologies out there

If I look around now I see every surface as an opportunity

For example I was driving in the train through the Westland

the area in the Netherlands with all the greenhouses

There I saw all this glass and thought

what if we integrate those with transparent solar glass

What if we integrate traditional farming

that requires a lot of energy

together with hightech and combine those

With this idea in mind I created Power Plant

I had a team of architects and engineers

but let me first explain how it works

We use transparent solar glass

to power its indoor climate

We use hydroponics that pumps around nutrified water

saving  percent of water usage

By stacking up in layers you are able to grow more yield per square meter

Extra light besides sunlight coming from these colored LED lights
LED
also enhances plant growth

As more and more people will live in big cities

by placing Power Plants on the rooftops

you don't have to fly it in from the other side of the world

you are able to grow it on the location itself

Well the big dream is to build these in offgrid places 

where there's no access to water electricity 

as an independent ecosystem

For this year's Design Biennial

I created the first fourmeter high model of the power plant

so you could come in and experience how plants grow

So it's a double harvest of sunlight

so both for the solar cells and for the plants

It's like a future botanical garden

where we celebrate all these modern technologies

And the biggest compliment I got was But where are the solar panels

And that's when I think design really works

when it becomes invisible and you don't notice it

I believe in solar democracy

solar energy for everyone everywhere

My aim is to make all surfaces productive

I want to build houses where all the windows curtains walls

even floors are harvesting electricity

Think about this on a big scale

in cities there are so many surfaces

The sun is still available for everyone

And by integrating solar on the place where we need it

we now have the opportunity to make solar cells accessible for everyone

I want to bring solar close to the people with you

but beautiful and well designed

Thank you

So what does it mean to be a woman

We all have XX chromosomes right
XX
Actually that's not true

Some women are mosaics

They have a mix of chromosome types with X with XY or with XXX
XXYXXX
If it's not just about our chromosomes

then what is being a woman about

Being feminine

Getting married

Having kids

You don't have to look far to find fantastic exceptions

to these rules

but we all share something that makes us women

Maybe that something is in our brains

You might have heard theories from last century

about how men are better at math than women

because they have bigger brains

These theories have been debunked

The average man has a brain about three times smaller

than the average elephant

but that doesn't mean

the average man is three times dumber than an elephant 

or does it

Laughter

There's a new wave of female neuroscientists

that are finding important differences between female and male brains

in neuron connectivity

in brain structure in brain activity

They're finding that the brain is like a patchwork mosaic 

a mixture

Women have mostly female patches and a few male patches

With all this new data what does it mean to be a woman

This is something that I've been thinking about almost my entire life

When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be transgender

they always ask

How do you know you're a woman

As a scientist I'm searching for a biological basis of gender

I want to understand what makes me me

New discoveries at the front edge of science

are shedding light on the biomarkers that define gender

My colleagues and I in genetics neuroscience physiology and psychology

we're trying to figure out exactly how gender works

These vastly different fields share a common connection 

epigenetics

In epigenetics we're studying how DNA activity
DNA
can actually radically and permanently change

even though the sequence stays the same

DNA is the long stringlike molecule that winds up inside our cells
DNA
There's so much DNA
DNA
that it actually gets tangled into these knotlike things 

we'll just call them knots

So external factors change how those DNA knots are formed
DNA
You can think of it like this

inside our cells there's different contraptions building things

connecting circuits

doing all the things they need to make life happen

Here's one that's sort of reading the DNA and making RNA
DNARNA
And then this one is carrying a huge sac of neurotransmitters

from one end of the brain cell

to the other

Don't they get hazard pay for this kind of work

Laughter

This one is an entire molecular factory 

some say it's the secret to life

It's call the ribosome

I've been studying this since 

One of the stunning things about our cells

is that the components inside them are actually biodegradable

They dissolve

and then they're rebuilt each day

kind of like a traveling carnival

where the rides are taken down and then rebuilt every single day

A big difference between our cells and the traveling carnival

is that in the carnival

there are skilled craftsmen that rebuild the rides each day

In our cells there are no such skilled craftsmen

only dumb builder machines

that build whatever's written in the plans

no matter what those plans say

Those plans are the DNA
DNA
The instructions for every nook and cranny inside our cells

If everything in say our brain cells

dissolves almost every day

then how can the brain remember anything past one day

That's where DNA comes in
DNA
DNA is one of the those things that does not dissolve
DNA
But for DNA to remember that something happened
DNA
it has to change somehow

We know the change can't be in the sequence

if it changed sequence all the time

then we might be growing like a new ear or a new eyeball every single day

Laughter

So instead it changes shape

and that's where those DNA knots come in
DNA
You can think of them like DNA memory
DNA
When something big in our life happens

like a traumatic childhood event

stress hormones flood our brain

The stress hormones don't affect the sequence of DNA
DNA
but they do change the shape

They affect that part of DNA
DNA
with the instructions for molecular machines that reduce stress

That piece of DNA gets wound up into a knot
DNA
and now the dumb builder machines can't read the plans they need

to build the machines that reduce stress

That's a mouthful but it's what's happening on the microscale

On the macroscale you practically lose the ability to deal with stress

and that's bad

And that's how DNA can remember what happens in the past
DNA
This is what I think was happening to me

when I first started my gender transition

I knew I was a woman on the inside

and I wore women's clothes on the outside

but everyone saw me as a man in a dress

I felt like no matter how many things I try

no one would ever really see me as a woman

In science your credibility is everything

and people were snickering in the hallways

giving me stares

looks of disgust 

afraid to be near me

I remember my first big talk after transition

It was in Italy

I'd given prestigious talks before

but this one I was terrified

I looked out into the audience

and the whispers started 

the stares

the smirks the chuckles

To this day I still have social anxiety around my experience eight years ago

I lost hope

Don't worry I've had therapy so I'm OK 

I'm OK now

Laughter

Cheers

Applause

But I felt enough is enough

I'm a scientist

I have a doctorate in astrophysics

I've published in the top journals

in waveparticle interactions space physics

nucleic acid biochemistry

I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things so 

Laughter

I went online 

Applause

So I went online and I found fascinating research papers

I learned that these DNA knot things are not always bad
DNA
Actually the knotting and unknotting 

it's like a complicated computer language

It programs our bodies with exquisite precision

So when we get pregnant

our fertilized eggs grow into newborn babies

This process requires thousands of DNA decisions to happen
DNA
Should an embryo cell become a blood cell

A heart cell A brain cell
 
And the decisions happen at different times during pregnancy

Some in the first trimester some in the second trimester

and some in the third trimester

To truly understand DNA decisionmaking
DNA
we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic detail

Even the most powerful microscopes can't see this

What if we tried to simulate these on a computer

For that we'd need a million computers to do that

That's exactly what we have at Los Alamos Labs 

a million computers connected in a giant warehouse

So here we're showing the DNA making up an entire gene
DNA
folded into very specific shapes of knots

For the first time

my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA 
DNA
the largest biomolecular simulation performed to date

For the first time we're beginning to understand the unsolved problem

of how hormones trigger the formation of these knots

DNA knot formation can be seen beautifully in calico cats
DNA
The decision between orange and black

happens early on in the womb

so that orangeandblack patchy pattern

it's an exact readout of what happened

when that cat was just a tiny little kitten embryo

inside her mom's womb

And the patchy pattern actually happens in our brains and in cancer

It's directly related to intellectual disability and breast cancer

These DNA decisions also happen in other parts of the body
DNA
It turns out that the precursor genitals transform into either female or male

during the first trimester of pregnancy

The precursor brains on the other hand

transform into female or male during the second trimester of pregnancy

So the current working model

is that a unique mix in my mom's womb

caused the precursor genitals to transform one way

but the precursor brain to transform the other way

Most of epigenetic research

has really focused on stress anxiety depression 

kind of a downer

kind of bad things

Laughter

But nowadays 

the latest stuff 

people are looking at relaxation

Can that have a positive effect on your DNA
DNA
Right now we're missing key data from mice models

We know that mice relax

but could they meditate like the Dalai Lama

Achieve enlightenment

Could they move stones with their mind like Jedi Master Yoda

Yoda voice Hm a Jedi mouse must feel the force flow hm

Laughter

Applause

I wonder if the support I've had since that talk back in Italy

has tried to unwind my DNA
DNA
Having a great circle of friends supportive parents

and being in a loving relationship

has actually given me strength and hope to help others

At work I wear a rainbow bracelet

Sometimes it raises eyebrows but it also raises awareness

There's so many transgender people 

especially women of color 

that are just one demeaning comment away from taking their own lives

Forty percent of us attempt suicide

If you're listening and you feel like you have no other option

try to call a friend

go online or try to get in a support group

If you're a woman who's not transgender but you know pain of isolation

of sexual assault 

reach out

So what does it mean to be a woman

The latest research is showing

that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb

possibly giving us females this innate sense of being a woman

On the other hand

maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women

We come in so many different shapes and sizes

that asking what it means to be a woman may not be the right question

It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat

Maybe becoming a woman means accepting ourselves

for who we really are

and acknowledging the same in each other

I see you

And you've just seen me

Applause and cheers

AG And another

Kid  Mr Peabody and Sherman

AG My kids have seen a lot of cartoons

Kids A lot

Laughter

Kid  On the TV and in the movie theater

AG My wife and I love animated films too

When we were growing up

there was only one name in animated movies 

Music

Disney

For about six decades they were pretty much the only game in town

By the mids Disney films had started to follow a formula

They would take an old story add a few musical numbers and  voil 
 
Pocahontas Hercules Mulan

But then something new happened in animation

Audio clip Toy Story To infinity and beyond

AG Pixar reinvented how you make an animated movie

Instead of drawing characters you code them on a computer

which makes them come alive in D instead of being flat and twodimensional

I'm sure you remember Pixar's first computeranimated movie

Toy Story

Clip Toy Story There's a snake in my boot

AG It was a smash

Not just because the tech was cool but also because the story was fresh

Brad Bird It was just so vivid and funny and the characters were original

AG This is Brad Bird

He's a writer animator and director

BB They weren't doing the  songs
BB
and all that stuff that was getting very standard in animation at the time

AG Pixar's first three films got multiple Oscar nominations

They grossed over a billion dollars

The studio was a perfectly calibrated hit machine

And that's when they made a strange decision

they hired Brad

He was coming off a big project that tanked

BB Don't make me go back there man Don't make me go back
BB 
AG And it wasn't his first failure

BB I got fired from Disney

and I was actually fired from two of the first three jobs I held

AG But Pixar saw promise in Brad

He came to the studio with a bold vision for a new film

And he didn't recruit the star teams who had created their earlier hits

Instead he deliberately assembled a band of Pixar's biggest misfits

BB Black sheep
BB
John Walker Disgruntled

Nicole Paradis Grindle I say pirate

AG Doesn't exactly sound like a dream team
AG
But somehow the movie they made together grossed over  million dollars

won two Oscars

and was Pixar's biggest hit yet

It was  incredible

Multiple voices Incredible Incredible Incredible

AG The critics loved it almost as much as my kids did

In this show

I'm inviting myself inside the minds of some truly unusual people

Today shakeups and the value of the outsiders inside your workplace

Thanks to Bonobos for sponsoring this episode
Bonobos
What's the best time to shake things up

In most workplaces it happens when you're struggling

When the chips are down you're desperate

and you have nothing to lose by taking some risks

But by then it's often too late

You don't have the resources to run bold experiments

The evidence suggests that the best time to shake things up

is actually when you're doing well

That's when you have the time energy and freedom to innovate

But sadly research shows that success often makes us complacent

Experts call it the fat cat syndrome

Think about a time when you've been at the top of your game

Did you really want to embrace something radically different

Of course not

You probably became overconfident in your recipe

and resistant to try new things

Take Blockbuster Video
Blockbuster Video
At one point they were apparently opening a new store every  hours

So they didn't see any reason to buy a little mailorder company

called Netflix
Netflix
Oops

One day the CEO of a successful company gave me that line I hate

But that's the way we've always done it

My answer

Blockbuster BlackBerry Polaroid Toys 'R' Us
'R'Us
Do you want me to keep going

So how do you shake things up before it's too late

For that we're going to the movies

Music

In  Warner Brothers released the first animated movie

directed by Brad Bird

Iron Giant

John Walker I remember being so excited about it

AG This is Brad's producer John Walker

It was the first big project for both Brad and John

On opening day John went to see it in a big theater in Times Square

JW And there were three people in there
JW
And I went What the heck is going on

So I spent the rest of the day just hanging around in front of the marquee

and whenever anybody would come by and look at the poster

I'd go It's a really good movie I'll buy your tickets

Laughs

I probably bought like  people tickets to see it

because there was no one in the theaters it was empty

Empty

It was just sad

AG Ouch

JW So I thought that's it that's the end of me
JW
I'll have The Iron Giant on my resume and nothing more

AG The film failed commercially

But it was wildly original

And the leaders at Pixar saw potential there

So Brad Bird and John Walker got the call from two of the studio's cofounders

Ed Catmull and Steve Jobs
Ed CatmullSteve Jobs
JW They go you know
JW
We'll bring this bacteria in from the outside

and see if it grows in the petri dish you know

BB They were actively choosing a guy to come up
BB
who had just made a big flop

AG Pixar was founded on a disruptive vision

Their leaders fervently believed it was never too early

to throw your own recipe out the window

Steve Jobs wanted to keep raising the bar
Steve Jobs
bigger hits longer run times

So he picked a couple of outsiders to drive a shakeup

BB They were feeling like We're in danger of falling into certain habits
BB
because we have the same group that are doing things

And we're very proud of this group and this group is very talented

But we want to shake things up

And they felt like whatever I was going to do

it was going to be different

JW And so they said OK well here Can you guys do it
JW
Can you do it in half the time half the money

AG They gave the answer you'd probably give

if Steve Jobs had asked you that question

JW Well sure we can
JW
Laughter

You know You just say you can right
 
And then you try to go figure out how to do it

AG So Pixar hired John Walker and Brad Bird

Brad had been working on a new story for an animated film

It would be called The Incredibles

And it was different than anything Pixar had ever done

BB Everything that the film was

was all the things that CG animation was then terrible at
CG
It was full of humans which

they were the weakest thing in CG animation
CG
if you look at humans circa that time

AG Pixar films had only had humans as minor characters

And they didn't look very convincing

To date Pixar's movies were mostly filled with toys

monsters and talking bugs

Now Brad was pitching a movie

that would require animating a whole family of not just humans

humans with superpowers

BB It was full of water and fire and wind
BB
and all this stuff that CG animation was no good at doing
CG
Hair

AG It turns out hair was a real problem

Prior to The Incredibles no one had even bothered to code long hair

because it was just impossible in CG animation
CG
BB It's almost like everybody used a ton of hair spray before they got filmed

because the hair doesn't move much

And you know we were doing a film where it was part of Violet's character

AG Violet is a member of the Incredibles family 

a shy moody teenager

Clip The Incredibles Violet Normal What do you know about normal
 
What does anyone in this family know about normal

AG She was supposed to spend a huge part of the film

covering her face with her long black hair

JW We'd seen these beautiful tests
JW
AG Producer John Walker

JW And it was like
JW
wow she's shaking her head and the hair is flowing

and it's gorgeous and it's going to be beautiful

AG But the tests were oversimplified
AG
The hair moved right but kind of looked like strips of rubber

When it was time to do the full computer animation

Violet's hair looked awful

So John asked what it would take to get it right

And he was shocked at the answer

JW We can't actually do the movie like that
JW
That would take  years and  million dollars

I was like Then why did you show us that

I'm trying to get myself ready

to go tell Brad that we're going to cut Violet's hair

BB You can't do it
BB
That's the character She's got to have the hair

As the film goes on she feels enough growing selfassurance

that she pulls the hair out of her face

Her hair had a story arc

Laughter

AG To do hair and water and all these other new images correctly

Pixar execs guessed that the film could cost half a billion dollars

and take a decade to make

Brad needed some original thinking

So this unconventional director went looking for a team

of unconventional recruits 

the outsiders among Pixar's insiders

The black sheep

BB They are not always the um
BB
smilingest easiest people to work with

Sometimes theyre a little grumpy

AG Brad have you ever been a black sheep yourself

BB Yeah Yeah
BB
Yes Yeah

My family was kind of like the family in The Incredibles

We had these dinners where everybody vented

and said what they thought

That's the attitude that I kind of grew up in

And I found very quickly the world doesn't work that way

AG Brad searched Pixar's ranks

for people who were frustrated with the status quo

people who had risky ideas that had been dismissed or overlooked

You might have one of those people on your team

Or maybe you're the black sheep

BB There's a big impetus especially with success
BB
to repeat whatever has worked before

You know If it ain't broke don't fix it
 
But I was looking for a bunch of people

that were kind of dissatisfied with the way things were

AG Turns out Brad was onto something

Research shows that the kind of frustration he harnessed

can fuel creativity

In other words the curmudgeons on your team

could be great untapped resources

I'm sure you've seen companies hire external consultants or executives

to shake things up

But there's evidence that you don't have to turn to outside hires

You can go to the black sheep already working within the company

Consider one study

that was done at a company that makes oil drilling equipment

Supervisors evaluated how often employees brought new and innovative ideas

to the table

The employees who were rated the most creative

were the ones who felt dissatisfied with their jobs

Their frustration with problems motivated them to develop fresh solutions

But dissatisfaction didn't always lead to creativity

It only helped when people felt committed to the company

and had access to the feedback and support they needed

When you ignore them disgruntled people channel their frustration

in unproductive or even counterproductive directions

If you're aware they're out there though and you really listen to them

they can become your allies

Lisa Bodell They always say

Innovation is the pirate ship that sails into the yacht club

Nobody likes it but they appreciate it later

AG This is Lisa Bodell

She spent part of her career in advertising and startups

LB I came there to do really great motivating and inspiring things

and I was spending my day just managing processes and procedures and crap

AG Lisa got fed up with the dozens of meaningless tasks

that define so many work environments

So she started a company called FutureThink

to help organizations shake up the status quo

Clip LB  and ideally walk away with things
LB
that will help you simplify your work and your life

to get you moving forward

And what I thought we could do is go through about  I don't know

 PowerPoint slides
PowerPoint
Does that work for you all Laughter
 
No

AG Her big breakthrough came

when she was giving a talk to a few dozen executives

at a manufacturing company

LB I realized quickly that these people didn't give a crap

about what I was talking about

And so I called a break

and I said Listen I'm going to shake things up

AG She looked at all these bored executives

and told them to kill their own company

LB I challenged each of those groups
LB
to identify who their number one competitor was

And then I said Pretend you're that competition

Pretend you have that hat on

I want you to put yourself out of business

I mean  the room lit on fire

They were so excited because I gave them permission

to talk about the things that were literally verboten
verboten
It was a mindset shift as well as a business strategy shift

AG When I heard about the exercise

I was expecting a roomful of complaints and cynicism

Then I watched it happen

And I have never seen a more energized group of leaders in my life

LB Really what it does is give people a framework and permission

to start attacking things that aren't working

And that's what's energizing to people

They don't know the difference Adam

between being in a groove and being in a rut

And most people when you talk about complacency are in a rut

And until you talk to them about

What do you wish you could change Why are you frustrated
 
they get pumped up

AG One thing that's always fascinated me about this exercise
AG
is how different it would be if you ran it as save the company

And I was interested in hearing

what led you to the boldness of killing the company

rather than saving the company

LB Save means safe and preserve

You know I think of a life preserver
 
How can we keep what we have safe

versus How can we get rid of what we have and do things better

It's permission to admit that things might not be right

so you can look at what's not working and make space for things that are

AG If you were asked to kill your company

where would you start

You might begin the way Lisa does

gather some people together to give their frustration a voice

Put them on offense not defense

by asking them to attack the problems they see

And then invite them to run with their best ideas

Lisa's approach has worked in all kinds of environments
Lisa
banks tech companies city governments schools

And Brad Bird did his own version of it at Pixar

BB Pixar kind of invented a lot of the stuff

that now everyone takes for granted

I mean they were the best in the world at it

Those methods weren't going to work for our film

AG Brad challenged the black sheep to try different solutions

to their toughest animation problems

like Violet's hair

BB They don't want to do something the way that it's always been done
BB
For every  people that say This is how you do it

there's usually one person going

Uh you don't have to do it that way There's another way that you could do it

AG But there was one problem that neither Brad nor John Walker had anticipated

JW They were in different rooms they were doing different things

AG The technical people had been unleashed to build all these new tools
AG
But the creative people didn't really understand how to use them

JW Something would go wrong
JW
an email would come from one side going

Hey your simulator is broken

over to the people that were building the simulator

And the simulator guys would write back

No no no no  it's operator error

And they would go back and forth like that

And we'd go Oh gosh This is not working

AG Brad and John started listening to the people on the front lines

And they suddenly realized there was a simple solution

to their complex problem

put the technical people together with the animators in the same rooms

JW As soon as that started to happen it was like magic
JW
because somebody would show them the problem and say

Look what happens  I do this and the hair flies around the room

And the guy building the simulator goes

Well you've got to hit F and put this little bit of the code in there
F
Didn't you know that

And they go No we didn't know that

Beautiful thing when you go after black sheep you say

Hey I'll give your crazy idea a try

That's kind of where they want to go

AG So wait Brad 

does that mean you're just trying to surround yourself constantly

with angry people

BB No I mean I don't want just disgruntled people
BB
There's plenty of those

and they don't do a damn thing for anybody

I want people who are disgruntled

because they have a better way of doing things

and they are having trouble finding an avenue 

racing cars that are just spinning their wheels in a garage

rather than racing

You open that garage and man those people will take you somewhere

Theme music

AG So you've got your team of dissatisfied people
AG
You're ready for them to shake things up

Now how do you get them all innovating in the same direction

More on that after the break

Theme music

OK this is going to be a different kind of ad

I've played a personal role in selecting the sponsors for this podcast

because they all have interesting cultures of their own

Today we're going inside the workplace at Bonobos
Bonobos
A few years ago Sam Gonzalez was on an allstaff call at Bonobos
Sam GonzalezBonobos
when the top boss said something that took his breath away

Sam Gonzalez She had said

one of the things in that conference call was that we were going to embrace

in our marketing campaigns we were going to start to think about gender identity

AG For Sam a guide in one of Bonobos's shops
Bonobos
the idea that a men's clothing brand was going to focus on gender identity

wasn't just exciting

it was personal

SG I'd worked at Bonobos for a little over a year
Bonobos
before I figured out that I am trans and I want to transition

And that will include for me

letting everyone that I work with know and everyone who comes into my life know

that this is a part of who I am

AG Sam had prepared for the worst

SG What does it mean to transition at work
SG
Because I had only heard horror stories

But then once I did I was proved  percent wrong

People were super open

they were incredibly caring and respectful

AG And then just a few months later

Sam found himself on this allhands phone call

Micky Onvural then the copresident and now Bonobos CEO

said the company was going to start a public conversation

about gender identity

As soon as the call finished Sam sent her an email

SG I said I don't know if you know this but I am trans

and I have transitioned at Bonobos and I've been here for a while
Bonobos
And you have no idea

what this type of representation means to someone like me

Micky Onvural When I first got Sam's email

I was to be honest completely overwhelmed

I think I probably shed a tear or two

I'm Micky Onvural I am the CEO of Bonobos

For me it was very touching that someone felt comfortable enough

to be able to tell me that personal story

AG Think about how rare that is

for a junior employee to feel comfortable emailing someone that high up

I almost never see it

even though I spend a lot of time encouraging senior leaders to be open

At Bonobos Micky wasn't just receptive to new ideas from below

she actively encouraged them

SG  and I had talked a little bit about in my email
SG
that I had met Chris Mosier

and I think that he would be a fantastic person for us to highlight

MO The first thing I did I forwarded it on to our production team

and I said Sam's just had this amazing idea

of us bringing Chris Mosier in and shooting him in our clothes

Let's do it

AG Chris Mosier was part of the American men's duathlon team in 
Chris MosierAmerican Men's Duathlon Team
That made him the first openly transgender athlete to compete for Team USA

SG Chris was one of the first people that I saw

that made me feel like being trans is a thing

and you can do it and you can transition and you can be happy

AG So Sam made a pitch for Bonobos to feature Chris in a commercial

Chris Mosier For a men's clothing company to say

trans men are men and can be a part of our campaign

to me personally was a big deal

AG That's Chris

A few months later Bonobos launched a commercial that featured him
Bonobos
CM It was sort of what I was searching for when I was younger
CM
Like if I would have seen out trans men being a part of men's campaigns

being a part of men's fashion magazines or commercials on TV

that are talking about men and masculinity

I think that my trajectory would have been drastically different as a person

AG So Sam as you reflect on this whole experience

of first transitioning at work and then bringing on Chris as a spokesperson

how does that make you feel

SG There's not really a word to describe it
SG
I think awesome is too small of a word

AG Awesome is too small a word

I like that

And I like the idea that big ideas can come from anywhere in a company

as long as there's support at the top

When you're gathering a group of people for a major shakeup

how do you motivate them

Your first instinct is probably to inspire them

Clip Apollo  We never lost an American in space

we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch

Failure is not an option

Clip The Golden Age Let them come with the armies of hell

They will not pass Cheers
 
Clip The Waterboy You can do it

AG If you're working with a bunch of disgruntled black sheep

you'll feel especially compelled to convey confidence

show enthusiasm

and make sure they don't get discouraged by the sheer difficulty of the task

But if you're Brad Bird and you're making The Incredibles

you do the exact opposite

Brad told his team no one thought they could pull it off

Nicole Paradis Grindle That's the kind of challenge that lights a fuse in Brad

And that's how he leads our teams

AG This is Nicole Paradis Grindle
Nicole Paradis Grindle
She's been a producer at Pixar since the mids

When Nicole joined The Incredibles team

they'd been struggling with the animation for about a year

NPG I was working with the engineers

who were trying to figure out how to do the hair and the cloth

And they were saying it was impossible Brad was asking for too much 

And they just kept saying Nope nope nope we can't do it

They were trying and the stuff they were producing looked terrible

We have these crew meetings once a week

so everyone's wandering in first thing in the morning with their coffee

piling into this big theater that we have

And he gets up in front of this room of people

and he just starts yelling and telling them

They think we can't do this

They think we're too slow they think we're not good enough

I'm telling you we're going to do this

You know And people love it  I mean it's this pep rally
 
AG What Brad did by instinct is actually backed by evidence

If you want to motivate black sheep give them a battle to fight

a particular kind of battle

BB One thing that is very effective is to find a common enemy
BB
But the enemy doesn't have to be a person

It can be a mindset

It can be a presumption

It can be a system that doesn't want to change

It can even be something like a trend in movies

that is just making movies stupider

You can make that the enemy

And you can put it up in front of people and say

You know what I don't like I don't like X
 X
And here's how I think we can not do this thing that everyone is doing

and really dazzle the audience

And people like that

because you're putting them on the pirate ship

You're not going with the wellfunded safe routes

You're kind of striking your sails in a storm

And you're OK with it

That fires people up you know

It fires me up

Samir Nurmohamed It sounds like in that moment

Brad was shaping how his team perceived those outside of their team

and basically framed those individuals as critics or naysayers

AG This is Samir Nurmohamed my colleague at Wharton

He studies what happens when we're cast in the role of underdog

SN Stories of underdogs and favorites permeate societies
Sn
David versus Goliath Horatio Alger

Ivan the Fool in Russian literature

You see these examples of underdogs going from rags to riches

or performing against others' low expectations

across the world

AG An underdog isn't a kind of person

It's a mindset that can help you approach problems

the way black sheep do

You can position people as underdogs

by telling them they're not expected to succeed

And surprisingly

the uphill battle is often the one that people are most excited to fight

In a study with job seekers who had faced discrimination in their careers

Samir randomly assigned some of them to tell a story

about how they had been underdogs against the odds

It almost doubled their chances of landing a job in the following month

SN You actually experience more efficacy and more confidence to do well

and it leads to higher performance

AG In another study

Samir had people fill out a survey about their negotiating style

Then he told them that based on their results

he had calculated the probability of their success in a negotiation

He told some participants they were the favorites

some they were evenly matched

and told others that they were the underdogs

SN The underdog actually ended up reaching the more creative solution

People who were told that they couldn't succeed

actually ended up performing better

And the reason for this

is that they essentially wanted to prove the researchers wrong

AG The favorites had nothing to prove They got complacent

The underdogs were driven to show they had been misjudged

which happens in all kinds of jobs

Even Michael Jordan motivated himself this way
Michael Jordan
SN Even in his Hall of Fame induction speech

when the world came out to celebrate with him

he was calling out his school coach who chose another player over him

and how this fueled his motivation to prove them wrong

What's remarkable is that Jordan was talking about being underestimated

after being universally recognized as not only the greatest basketball player ever

but as one of the greatest athletes of all time

Jordan was still constructing that perception of being underestimated

and using that as motivation to prove others wrong

AG But before you start cutting down all your colleagues

in the name of motivation

keep in mind that there's a wrong way to do it

SN This doesn't mean you go around the workplace

telling everyone that they can't succeed

That's not the way to instill this motivation

As a person in this position who's seen as an underdog

you have to feel like you have the capabilities to succeed

AG For the underdog approach to work
AG
the low expectations need to come from the right messenger

a natural adversary

SN When a really credible person tells you you can't succeed

in some sense you basically internalize those expectations your confidence drops

you actually believe them and you don't perform as successfully

On the other hand

when you receive low expectations from someone who's not seen as credible

you perceive them as really incompetent or not knowledgeable

about either the domain that you're performing in

or your own abilities

This is what sparks that desire to prove others wrong

AG So if you're rallying salespeople

you can emphasize that RD doesn't think they can hit their targets

And if you're trying to motivate technical or creative people

you can tell them they're being doubted by a bunch of suits

NPG That's what those black sheep probably are looking for

is an opportunity to show what they can do

AG Pixar producer Nicole Grindle saw Brad's underdog gambit pay off

The black sheep at the studio felt the naysayers had no business

judging their abilities 

or the new animation techniques they were about to invent

NPG The idea that we're proving folks wrong
NPG
I think is the prime motivator

I mean of course we want to make a great film and a great story

and that's a given

But proving that you know

proving to the man that we're better than they think we are 

that's exciting

And that's what folks in this industry live to do

is you know act in that kind of a story

Laughs

AG The last step for energizing your shakeup team
AG
is to calibrate the degree of difficulty

How challenging should the goal be

BB I think you always have the impossible task
BB
because basically to do really good work is hard

And if you're doing it right you are kind of an underdog

You should be shooting for something that's out of reach

And maybe you don't hit it

but at the end of it

if you are reaching for something that's beyond your reach

you're probably going to extend your reach from your previous work

AG In psychology we call that kind of reach

a justmanageable difficulty

It's a challenge that tests and stretches your skills

to the very edge of what you think is possible

It has to be tough

but it can't set you up for certain failure either

As Pixar producer John Walker puts it
John Walker
JW Sometimes you have to swim upstream
JW
Sometimes you have to swim upstream

But if you swim upstream too long

something is probably wrong

Music

AG OK I came away from Pixar convinced that to shake things up

it can help to recruit the people you'd least expect  frustrated people 

and listen to them

Then motivate them by making them into underdogs

against the odds or a difficult enemy

But I was curious about whether this could all work

in a place that's the total opposite of Pixar

the ultimate bureaucracy

an environment where strict orders are followed

old traditions crush new technologies

and creativity isn't just not rewarded

it's sometimes actively punished

Clip Recruit training

where a man is taught the basic skills for the sea

AG The US Navy

Clip old recruitment ad He learns to be part of the team

He learns where he might fit in

AG A few years ago a military general told me

that if I wanted to understand innovation in the armed forces

I had to talk to a junior naval officer named Ben Kohlmann

Ben Kohlmann My grandfather was a World War II aviator

and my great uncle was an Air Force pilot who was shot down over Vietnam

and spent five years in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain and Jim Stockdale

And those stories infused my upbringing

And I wanted to be leading carrier battle fleets

against whoever was attacking the United States

AG So I was surprised to hear Ben's colleagues call him a black sheep

a rabblerouser

a troublemaker

BK Troublemaker is an amusing term for me

and I think my parents would get a kick out of that

AG Do you think you are one though Or you became one in the Navy
 
BK I think I became a troublemaker
BK
in the sense of challenging established wisdom

AG Ben may have been a sailor but he didn't start out as a pirate

BK I was in a fraternity that was known for its parties

but was the guy doing risk management on the outside

making sure nothing too crazy went down

AG Ben became a naval aviator just like the pilots in Top Gun

Music from Top Gun

Their call signs were Maverick and Iceman
MaverickIceman
BK My call sign was Professor
BK
because I had this habit of reading long books

like The American History of Law

and listening to classical music

AG When Ben flew missions as a naval pilot

he had a huge amount of autonomy

BK Being a yearold who's leading two  million jets
BK
with you know  or pound bombs

this is an incredible amount of responsibility on a daily basis

You were the onscene commander

AG But when Ben came back from overseas deployment

he started getting frustrated 

frustrated that people were getting rewarded

based on seniority instead of performance

frustrated that people were getting promoted for conformity

instead of original thinking

frustrated that a fieldtested combat pilot

couldn't even have a beer on a Friday night

without seeking approval from a senior commander

BK You know there's five or six levels of approval
BK
Even if the first four people say yes

it only takes one veto to kill an idea

And so that becomes very discouraging

and you stop caring to some extent

AG So Ben wrote an essay for a military news site

He explained his frustration

and challenged the Navy to start supporting and promoting junior people

with disruptive ideas

Piping up like that is sort of not done in the military

BK And I said some pretty intemperate things
BK
if I'm reflecting on it

But it got the attention of a lot of senior officials

who were aghast that I would write something like this

AG But some leaders were open to Ben's perspective

A Navy admiral was setting up something called a rapid innovation cell

And he asked Ben to direct it

Now to give you a sense for how slowly the Navy adopts new technologies

some of their computers are still running Windows 
Windows 
Windows  Tada sound
WindowsTada 
Yet over the next year

Ben's rapid innovation cell succeeded in getting D printers
D
installed on ships

They also tested a robot fish

affectionately named Silent Nemo for stealth underwater missions

It looks like a tuna in case you were wondering

Ben fueled these advances with the same strategies we saw at Pixar

His first step was to recruit black sheep

Many of them had been disciplined for insubordination

like one guy who was fired from a nuclear submarine

for disobeying an order

BK It ended up being one of the key innovation catalysts
BK
AG How did you find them

Was that a signal that you were deliberately looking for

Let me just find a bunch of people who are pissed off

BK Yeah Laughs
BK 
If you had the guts and the willingness to put your name onto an idea

and publish it

that already set you apart from the crowd

And disruptors while they're lone wolves to some extent

they also find each other

whether it's in the cubicle next door or the building across the way

or even across the country

AG Second Ben gathered them together to really listen to their frustrations

rather than squash them

BK One of the phrases that really makes me angry
BK
is when senior leaders say

If you have a problem

don't tell it to me unless you have a solution

Oftentimes junior people have lots of problems

they don't know the solutions to

and they need guidance

This is untapped energy that's just waiting to be unleashed

AG Third Ben rallied them around a common enemy

in this case middle managers

BK We had this mismatch between senior officers
BK
who really and truly wanted the crazy ideas

with those below them who had a mandate to slow those things down

And if we didn't get their approval

then we just jumped ahead of them to their senior

who usually was in our favor

And you can use the bureaucracy against itself in this sense

because people will always fall in line

AG In Ben's view the lasting impact of his work was in demonstrating

that this kind of innovation could be fueled from the bottom up

by black sheep inside the Navy

They planted seeds for dozens of other rapid innovation cells

across the military

BK And so for me the greatest success is the mindset that it created

within a very bureaucratic organization

to take charge to empower people to run with an idea

and build a community of support around that

and do it regardless of whether or not you had official support

AG Alright as much as I love this whole recipe

I have one little problem with it

You can only use it once

If you succeed people aren't underdogs anymore

That was Brad Bird's big challenge

when it came time to make a sequel to The Incredibles

This time the team was stacked with hit makers

There was no common enemy

And they had three and a half years to make the film

It seems like it would have been harder to frame the crew as underdogs

given how remarkably successful the original movie was

BB Except that they took a year off of our schedule
BB
And suddenly we're the underdogs again

We had a hell of a mountain to climb

that in many ways was taller than our first one

NPG The studio asked us to release the film a year earlier

than what we had originally planned

A year is a lot

We tried to reestablish that underdog theme

And taking a year off the schedule sure helped

AG That's one way to turn superstars into underdogs again

But to make it work the new challenge has to be meaningful or exciting

not just an arbitrary burden

BB You know there's an attitude out there
BB
a bunch of people with their arms folded like

This better be good

You know

Which doesn't help inspire you to do anything good

You know

But what is challenging is can you take a year off the schedule

and still come out with a great movie

and come in on or under budget and you know drop the mic

AG The team had the fuel they needed

It became a justmanageable difficulty

Incredibles  grossed over a billion dollars

in its first two months alone

eclipsing the original film's total theatrical revenues

It was nominated for an Oscar

and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Family Movie

BB Yes it's cool for adults and kids
BB
AG That's what a bunch of black sheep can do

Theme music

And oh yeah 

it's now the highest grossing animated film in American history

Most importantly it got six thumbs up from my favorite experts

Clip with kids What was the first thing you said

when we came out of the theater

Kid  I want to see it again and again

AG How many times have you seen it

Kid  Uh  four

AG You've seen it four times Why
 
Kid  Because I like it

Kid  I think it was twice in the same week

Reviewer Camille Martnez
Camille Mart  nez
It was my first year as an atmospheric science professor

at Texas Tech University

We had just moved to Lubbock Texas

which had recently been named the second most conservative city

in the entire United States

A colleague asked me to guest teach his undergraduate geology class

I said Sure

But when I showed up the lecture hall was cavernous and dark

As I tracked the history of the carbon cycle

through geologic time to present day

most of the students were slumped over dozing or looking at their phones

I ended my talk with a hopeful request for any questions

And one hand shot up right away

I looked encouraging he stood up and in a loud voice he said

You're a democrat aren't you

Laughter

No I said I'm Canadian

Laughter

Applause

That was my baptism by fire

into what has now become a sad fact of life here in the United States

and increasingly across Canada as well

The fact that the number one predictor

of whether we agree that climate is changing

humans are responsible

and the impacts are increasingly serious and even dangerous

has nothing to do with how much we know about science or even how smart we are

but simply where we fall on the political spectrum

Does the thermometer give us a different answer

depending on if we're liberal or conservative

Of course not

But if that thermometer tells us that the planet is warming

that humans are responsible

and that to fix this thing

we have to wean ourselves off fossil fuels as soon as possible 

well some people would rather cut off their arm

than give the government any further excuse

to disrupt their comfortable lives and tell them what to do

But saying Yes it's a real problem but I don't want to fix it

that makes us the bad guy and nobody wants to be the bad guy

So instead we use arguments like It's just a natural cycle

It's the sun

Or my favorite

Those climate scientists are just in it for the money

Laughter

I get that at least once a week

But these are just scienceysounding smoke screens

that are designed to hide the real reason for our objections

which have nothing to do with the science

and everything to do with our ideology and our identity

So when we turn on the TV these days

it seems like pundit X is saying
X
It's cold outside Where is global warming now

And politician Y is saying
Y
For every scientist who says this thing is real

I can find one who says it isn't

So it's no surprise that sometimes we feel like everybody is saying these myths

But when we look at the data 

and the Yale Program on Climate [Change] Communication

has done public opinion polling across the country now for a number of years 

the data shows that actually  percent of people in the United States agree

that the climate is changing

And  percent also agree that it will harm plants and animals

and it will harm future generations

But then when we dig down a bit deeper the rubber starts to hit the road

Only about  percent of people think it will affect people in the United States

Only  percent of people think it will affect us personally

And then when you ask people Do you ever talk about this

twothirds of people in the entire United States say Never

And even worse when you say Do you hear the media talk about this

Over threequarters of people say no

So it's a vicious cycle

The planet warms

Heat waves get stronger

Heavy precipitation gets more frequent

Hurricanes get more intense

Scientists release yet another doomfilled report

Politicians push back even more strongly

repeating the same scienceysounding myths

What can we do to break this vicious cycle

The number one thing we can do is the exact thing that we're not doing

talk about it

But you might say I'm not a scientist

How am I supposed to talk about radiative forcing

or cloud parametrization in climate models

We don't need to be talking about more science

we've been talking about the science for over  years

Did you know that it's been  years or more since the s

when climate scientists first discovered

that digging up and burning coal and gas and oil

is producing heattrapping gases

that is wrapping an extra blanket around the planet

That's how long we've known

It's been  years since scientists first formally warned a US president

of the dangers of a changing climate

and that president was Lyndon B Johnson
B
And what's more the social science has taught us

that if people have built their identity on rejecting a certain set of facts

then arguing over those facts is a personal attack

It causes them to dig in deeper

and it digs a trench rather than building a bridge

So if we aren't supposed to talk about more science

or if we don't need to talk about more science

then what should we be talking about

The most important thing to do is

instead of starting up with your head with all the data and facts in our head

to start from the heart

to start by talking about why it matters to us

to begin with genuinely shared values

Are we both parents

Do we live in the same community

Do we enjoy the same outdoor activities hiking biking fishing even hunting

Do we care about the economy or national security

For me one of the most foundational ways I found to connect with people

is through my faith

As a Christian I believe that God created this incredible planet that we live on

and gave us responsibility over every living thing on it

And I furthermore believe that we are to care for and love

the least fortunate among us

those who are already suffering the impacts of poverty

hunger disease and more

If you don't know what the values are that someone has

have a conversation get to know them figure out what makes them tick

And then once we have

all we have to do is connect the dots between the values they already have

and why they would care about a changing climate

I truly believe after thousands of conversations that I've had

over the past decade and more

that just about every single person in the world

already has the values they need to care about a changing climate

They just haven't connected the dots

And that's what we can do through our conversation with them

The only reason why I care about a changing climate

is because of who I already am

I'm a mother so I care about the future of my child

I live in West Texas where water is already scarce

and climate change is impacting the availability of that water

I'm a Christian I care about a changing climate

because it is as the military calls it a threat multiplier

It takes those issues

like poverty and hunger and disease and lack of access to clean water

and even political crises that lead to refugee crises 

it takes all of these issues and it exacerbates them

it makes them worse

I'm not a Rotarian

But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club

I walked in and they had this giant banner that had the FourWay Test on it

Is it the truth

Absolutely

Is it fair

Heck no that's why I care most about climate change

because it is absolutely unfair

Those who have contributed the least to the problem

are bearing the brunt of the impacts

It went on to ask

Would it be beneficial to all would it build goodwill

Well to fix it certainly would

So I took my talk and I reorganized it into the FourWay Test

and then I gave it to this group of conservative businesspeople

in West Texas

Laughter

And I will never forget at the end

a local bank owner came up to me with the most bemused look on his face

And he said You know I wasn't sure about this whole global warming thing

but it passed the FourWay Test

Laughter

Applause

These values though  they have to be genuine

I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago

and after my talk a fellow scientist came up and he said

I need some help

I've been really trying hard to get my foot in the door

with our local churches

but I can't seem to get any traction

I want to talk to them about why climate change matters

So I said Well the best thing to do

is to start with the denomination that you're part of

because you share the most values with those people

What type of church do you attend

Oh I don't attend any church I'm an atheist he said

Laughter

I said Well in that case starting with a faith community

is probably not the best idea

Let's talk about what you do enjoy doing what you are involved in

And we were able to identify a community group

that he was part of that he could start with

The bottom line is we don't have to be a liberal tree hugger

to care about a changing climate

All we have to be is a human living on this planet

Because no matter where we live

climate change is already affecting us today

If we live along the coasts

in many places we're already seeing sunnyday flooding

If we live in western North America

we're seeing much greater area being burned by wildfires

If we live in many coastal locations

from the Gulf of Mexico to the South Pacific

we are seeing stronger hurricanes typhoons and cyclones

powered by a warming ocean

If we live in Texas or if we live in Syria

we're seeing climate change supersize our droughts

making them more frequent and more severe

Wherever we live we're already being affected by a changing climate

So you might say OK that's good We can talk impacts

We can scare the pants off people because this thing is serious

And it is believe me I'm a scientist I know

Laughter

But fear is not what is going to motivate us

for the longterm sustained change that we need to fix this thing

Fear is designed to help us run away from the bear

Or just run faster than the person beside us

Laughter

What we need to fix this thing is rational hope

Yes we absolutely do need to recognize what's at stake

Of course we do

But we need a vision of a better future 

a future with abundant energy

with a stable economy

with resources available to all

where our lives are not worse but better than they are today

There are solutions

And that's why the second important thing that we have to talk about

is solutions  practical viable accessible attractive solutions

Like what

Well there's no silver bullet as they say

but there's plenty of silver buckshot

Laughter

There's simple solutions that save us money

and reduce our carbon footprint at the same time

Yes light bulbs

I love my plugin car

I'd like some solar shingles

But imagine if every home came with a switch beside the front door

that when you left the house you could turn off everything except your fridge

And maybe the DVR

Laughter

Lifestyle choices eating local eating lower down the food chain

and reducing food waste which at the global scale

is one of the most important things that we can do to fix this problem

I'm a climate scientist

so the irony of traveling around to talk to people about a changing climate

is not lost on me

Laughter

The biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel

And that's why I carefully collect my invitations

I usually don't go anywhere unless I have a critical mass

of invitations in one place 

anywhere from three to four

to sometimes even as many as  or  talks in a given place 

so I can minimize the impact of my carbon footprint

as much as possible

And I've transitioned nearly threequarters of the talks I give

to video

Often people will say Well we've never done that before

But I say Well let's give it a try I think it could work

Most of all though

we need to talk about what's already happening today around the world

and what could happen in the future

Now I live in Texas

and Texas has the highest carbon emissions of any state in the United States

You might say Well what can you talk about in Texas

The answer is a lot

Did you know that in Texas there's over  jobs

in the wind energy industry

We are almost up to  percent of our electricity

from clean renewable sources most of that wind

though solar is growing quickly

The largest army base in the United States Fort Hood

is of course in Texas

And they've been powered by wind and solar energy now

because it's saving taxpayers over  million dollars

Yes

Applause

What about those who don't have the resources that we have

In subSaharan Africa there are hundreds of millions of people

who don't have access to any type of energy except kerosine

and it's very expensive

Around the entire world

the fastestgrowing type of new energy today is solar

And they have plenty of solar

So social impact investors nonprofits even corporations

are going in and using innovative new microfinancing schemes

like payasyougo solar

so that people can buy the power they need in increments

sometimes even on their cell phone

One company Azuri has distributed tens of thousands of units
Azuri
across  countries from Rwanda to Uganda

They estimate that they've powered over  million hours of electricity

and over  million hours of cell phone charging

What about the giant growing economies of China and India

Well climate impacts might seem a little further down the road

but air quality impacts are right here today

And they know that clean energy is essential to powering their future

So China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy

They're flooding coal mines

and they're putting floating solar panels on the surface

They also have a pandashaped solar farm

Applause

Laughter

Yes they're still burning coal

But they've shut down all the coal plants around Beijing

And in India they're looking to replace

a quarter of a billion incandescent light bulbs with LEDs
LED
which will save them seven billion dollars in energy costs

They're investing in green jobs

and they're looking to decarbonize their entire vehicle fleet

India may be the first country to industrialize

without relying primarily on fossil fuels

The world is changing

But it just isn't changing fast enough

Too often we picture this problem

as a giant boulder sitting at the bottom of a hill

with only a few hands on it trying to roll it up the hill

But in reality that boulder is already at the top of the hill

And it's got hundreds of millions of hands maybe even billions on it

pushing it down

It just isn't going fast enough

So how do we speed up that giant boulder so we can fix climate change in time

You guessed it

The number one way is by talking about it

The bottom line is this

climate change is affecting you and me right here right now

in the places where we live

But by working together we can fix it

Sure it's a daunting problem

Nobody knows that more than us climate scientists

But we can't give in to despair

We have to go out and actively look for the hope that we need

that will inspire us to act

And that hope begins with a conversation today

Thank you

Applause

T Morgan Dixon I would like to tell you about the most powerful woman

you've never heard of

This is Septima Clark

Remember her name Septima Clark

Dr King called her the the architect of the civil rights movement

because she created something called Citizenship Schools

And in those schools she taught ordinary women the practical skills

to go back into their communities and teach people to read

Because if they could read

they could vote

Well these women took those organizing skills

and they became some of the most legendary civil rights activists

this country has ever seen

Women like Diane Nash

You may know her

She orchestrated the entire walk from Selma to Montgomery

She was a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

and they integrated lunch counters

and they created the Freedom Rides

Or you may remember Fannie Lou Hamer

who sat on the floor of the Democratic National Convention

and talked about being beaten in jail cells

as she registered people to vote in Mississippi

And her most famous student

Rosa Parks

She said Septima Clark was the one who taught her

the peaceful act of resistance

And when she sat down

she inspired a nation to stand

These were just three of her  students

These women stood on the front lines of change

and by doing so

they taught people to read in her Citizenship School model

and empowered  new voters

And that's not it

She created a new culture of social activism

Pete Seeger said it was Septima Clark who changed the lyrics
Pete SeegerSeptima Clark
to the old gospel song

and made the anthem we all know

We Shall Overcome

Vanessa Garrison Now many of you may know us

We are the cofounders of GirlTrek
GirlTrek
the largest health organization for Black women in America

Our mission is simple

ask Black women

 percent of whom are over a healthy body weight

to walk outside of their front door every day

to establish a lifesaving habit of walking

in doing so ignite a radical movement

in which Black women reverse the devastating impacts

of chronic disease

reclaim the streets of their neighborhoods

create a new culture of health for their families

and stand on the front lines for justice

Today all across America

more than  Black women are wearing this GirlTrek blue shirt
GirlTrek
as they move through their communities 

a heroic force

We walk in the footsteps of Septima Clark

She gave us a blueprint for changemaking

One to have a bold idea

bigger than anyone is comfortable with

To two root down in the cultural traditions of your community

and lean heavily on what has come before

To three name it 

that one thing that everyone is willing to work hard for

a ridiculously simple goal that doesn't just benefit the individual

but the village around them

And to lastly

never ask permission to save your own life

It is our fundamental right as human beings

to solve our own problems

TMD So to the women all out there gathered in your living rooms
TMD
rooting for us acting crazy on social media right now 

we see you

Laughter

We see you every day We love you

You are not alone

and our bigger work starts now

VG You got us onto this stage 

your leadership

auditing blighted streets in Detroit

working with hospitals and health care systems in Harlem

praying over the streets of Sacramento Charlotte Brooklyn Flint

and every community that has seen trauma

changing traffic patterns making your streets safer

and most importantly

standing as role models

And it all started with your commitment to start walking

your agreement to organize your friends and family

and your belief in our broader mission

TMD It's important to me that everyone in this room understands
TMD
exactly how changemaking works in GirlTrek
GirlTrek
One welltrained organizer has the power to change the behavior

of  of her friends

We know that is true

because the [] women blowing up social media right now

have already inspired over  women to walk

Applause

But that is not nearly enough

And so our goal is to create critical mass

And in order to do that

we have an audacious plan to scale our intervention

A thousand organizers is not enough

GirlTrek is going to create the next Citizenship School
GirlTrek
And in doing so we will train  frontline health activists

and deploy them into the highestneed communities in America

Because when we do we will disrupt disease

we will create a new culture of health

And what we will do is create a support system

for one million Black women to walk to save their own lives

Applause

And our training is unparalleled

I just want you to imagine

It's like a revival tentlike festival

not unlike the civil rights movement teachins

And we're going to go all across the country

It is the biggest announcement this week

Vanessa and I and a team of masterful teachers

all to culminate next year

on sacred ground

in Selma Alabama

to create a new annual tradition that we are calling Summer of Selma

VG Summer of Selma will be an annual pilgrimage

that will include a walk 

 miles

the sacred route from Selma to Montgomery

It will also include rigorous training

Picture it

as women come to learn organizing and recruitment strategies

to study exercise science

to take nutrition classes

to learn storytelling

to become certified as outdoor trip leaders

and community advocates

TMD This is going to be unprecedented
TMD
It's going to be a moment in time like a cultural institution

and in fact

it's going to be the Woodstock of Black Girl Healing

Laughter

Applause

VG And the need 
VG
it's more urgent than ever

We are losing our communities' greatest resource

Black women are dying in plain sight

And not only is no one talking about it

but we refuse to acknowledge

that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice

that first propelled the civil rights movement

On December  of 

Erica Garner

the daughter of Eric Garner

a Black man who died on the streets of New York

from a police choke hold

passed away of a heart attack

Erica was just  years old

the mother of two children

She would be one of  Black women that day 

more than  in the last year 

to die from a heartrelated issue

many of their hearts broken from trauma

The impacts of stress on Black women

who send their children and spouses out the door each day

unsure if they will come home alive

who work jobs where they are paid  cents to every dollar paid to white men

who live in communities with crumbling infrastructure

with no access to fresh fruits or vegetables

with little to no walkable or green spaces 

the impact of this inequality is killing Black women

at higher and faster rates than any other group in the country

But that is about to change

It has to

TMD So let me tell you a story
TMD
About three weeks ago 

many of you may have watched 

Vanessa and I and a team of  women walked  miles

on the actual Underground Railroad

We did it in five days 

five long and beautiful days

And the world watched

Three million people watched the live stream

Some of you in here the influencers shared the story

Urban Radio blasted it across the country

VG Even the E News channel interrupted a story about the Kardashians 
VGE 
which if you asked us is just a little bit of justice 

Laughter

to report that GirlTrek had made it safely on our hundredmile journey
GirlTrek
Applause

TMD People were rooting for us
TMD
And they were rooting for us because in this time of confusion and contention

this journey allowed us all to reflect on what it meant to be American

We saw America up close and personal as we walked

We walked through historic towns

through dense forest

past former plantations

And one day

we walked into a gas station that was also a caf

and it was filled with men

They were wearing camo and had hunting supplies

And out front were all of their trucks and one had a Confederate flag

And so we left the establishment

And as we were walking along this narrow strip of road

a few of the trucks reared by us so close

and out of their tailpipe was the specter of mob violence

It was unnerving

But then it happened

Right on the border of Maryland and Delaware

we saw a man standing by his truck

The tailgate was down

He had on a brown jacket

He was standing there awkwardly

The first two girls in our group Jewel and Sandria
JewelSandria
they walked by because he looked suspicious

Laughter

But the bigger group we stopped to give him a chance

And he walked up to us and he said

Hi my name is Jake Green

I heard you on Christian radio this morning

and God told me to bring you supplies

He brought us water

he brought us granola

and he brought us tissue

And we needed tissue because we had just walked through a nor'easter

it was  degrees it was sleeting on our faces

Our sneakers and our socks were frozen and wet and frozen again

We needed that tissue more than he could have possibly understood

So on that day in that moment

Jake Green renewed my faith in God for sure

but he renewed my faith in humanity

We have a choice to make

In America we can fall further into the darkness of discord or not

And I am here to tell you

that the women of GirlTrek are walking through the streets
GirlTrek
with a light that cannot be extinguished

VG They are also walking through the streets with a mission
VG
as clear and as powerful as the women who marched in Montgomery

that disease stops here

that trauma stops here

And with your support

and in our ancestors' footsteps

these  newly trained activists will launch the largest health revolution

this country has ever seen

And they will return to their communities and model the best of human flourishing

And we 

we will all celebrate

Because like Jake Green understood

our fates are intertwined

Septima Clark once said

The air has finally gotten to a place where we can breathe it together

And yet

the haunting last words of Eric Garner were I can't breathe
Eric Garner
And his daughter Erica died at  years old

still seeking justice

So we 

we're going to keep doing Septima's work

until her words become reality

until Black women are no longer dying

until we can all breathe the air together

Thank you

Applause

Nearly  years ago

almost today

most women in the United States finally won the right to vote

Now it would take decades more for women of color to earn that right

and we've come a long way since

but I would argue not nearly far enough

I think what women want today

not just only in the United States but around the globe

is to no longer be an afterthought

We don't want to continue to try to like look at the next  years

and be granted grudgingly small legal rights and accommodations

We simply want true and full equality

I think that women are tired of retrofitting ourselves

into institutions and governments that were built by men for men

and we'd rather reshape the future on our own terms

I believe 

Applause

I believe what we need is a women's political revolution for full equality

across race across class across gender identity

across sexual orientation

and yes across political labels

because I believe what binds us together as women

is so much more profound than what keeps up apart

And so I've given some thought

about how to build this women's political revolution

and that's what I want to talk to you about today

Cheers

Applause

The good news is that one thing that hasn't changed in the last century

is women's resilience

and our commitment to build a better life not only for ourselves

but for generations to come

because I can't think of a single woman

who wants her daughter

to have fewer rights or opportunities than she's had

So we know we all stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us

and as for myself

I come from a long line of tough Texas women

Cheers

My grandparents lived outside of Waco Texas

in the country

And when my grandmother got pregnant

of course she was not going to go to the hospital to deliver

she was going to have that baby at home

But when she went into labor

she called the neighbor woman over to cook dinner for my grandfather

because 

I mean it was unthinkable that he was going to make supper for himself

Laughter

Been there

Laughter

The neighbor had no experience with killing a chicken

and that was what was planned for dinner that night

And so as the story goes

my grandmother in the birthing bed in labor

hoists herself up on one elbow and wrings that chicken's neck right

And that is how my mother came into this world

Laughter

Applause

But the amazing thing is

even though my mother's own grandmother could not vote in Texas

because under Texas law

idiots imbeciles the insane and women

were prevented the franchise 

just two generations later

my mother Ann Richards was elected the first woman governor in her own right

in the state of Texas

Applause and cheers

But you see when Mom was coming up in Texas

there weren't a lot of opportunities for women

and frankly she spent her entire life trying to change that

She used to like to say

As women if you just give us a chance we can perform

After all Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did
Ginger RogersFred Astaire
but she did it backwards and in high heels

Right

And honestly that's kind of what women have been doing for this last century

despite having very very little political power

we have made enormous progress

So today in the United States

 years after getting the right to vote

women are almost half the workforce

And in  percent of families with children

women are the major breadwinners

Economists even estimate

that if every single paid working woman took just one day off of work

it would cost the United States  billion dollars

in gross domestic product

Now largely because of Title IX which required educational equity

women are actually now half the college students in the United States

We're half the medical students we're half the law students 

Exactly

Applause

And a fact I absolutely love

One of the most recent classes of graduating NASA astronauts was 
NASA
What

For the first time  percent women

Applause and cheers

The point is that women are really changing industries

they're changing business from the inside out

But when it comes to government it's another story

and I actually think a picture is worth  words

This is a photograph from  at the White House

when congressional leaders were called over to put the final details

into the healthcare reform bill that was to go to Congress

Now one of the results of this meeting

was that they got rid of maternity benefits

which may not be that surprising

since no one at that table actually would need maternity benefits

And unfortunately that's what we've learned the hard way

in the US for women

If we're not at the table we're on the menu right

And we're simply not at enough tables

because even though women are the vast majority of voters

in the United States

we fall far behind the rest of the world in political representation

Recent research is that when they ranked all the countries

the United States is th in women's representation in office

th 

Right behind Indonesia

So is it any big surprise then

considering who's making decisions

we're the only developed country with no paid family leave

And despite all the research and improvements we've made

in medical care 

and this is really horrifying to me 

the United States now leads the developed world in maternal mortality rates

Now when it comes to equal pay we're not doing a whole lot better

Women now on average in the United States

still only make  cents to the dollar that a man makes

Though if you're an African American woman

it's  cents to the dollar

And if you're Latina it's  cents to the dollar

It's an outrage

Now women in the UK the United Kingdom

just came up with something I thought was rather ingenious

in order to illustrate the impact of the pay gap

So starting November  and going through the end of the year

they simply put an outofoffice memo on their email

to indicate all the weeks they were working without pay

Right

I think it's an idea that actually could catch on

But imagine if women actually had political power

Imagine if we were at the table making decisions

Imagine if we had our own women's political party

that instead of putting our issues to the side as distractions

made them the top priority

Well we know 

research shows that when women are in office

they actually act differently than men

They collaborate more with their colleagues

they work across party lines

and women are much more likely to support legislation

that improves access to health care education civil rights

And what we've seen in our research in the United States Congress

is that women sponsor more legislation

and they cosponsor more legislation

So all the evidence is that when women actually have the chance to serve

they make a huge difference and they get the job done

So how would it look in the United States if different people were making decisions

Well I firmly believe if half of Congress could get pregnant

we would finally quit fighting about birth control

and Planned Parenthood

Applause and cheers

That would be over

Applause

I also really believe that finally

businesses might quit treating pregnancy as a nuisance

and rather understand it as a primary medical issue

for millions of American workers

And I think if more women were in office

our government would actually prioritize keeping families together

rather than pulling them apart

Applause

But perhaps most importantly

I think all of these issues would no longer be seen as women's issues

They would just be seen as basic issues of fairness and equality

that everybody can get behind

So I think the question is

what would it take actually to build this women's political revolution

The good news is actually it's already started

Because women around the globe are demanding workplaces

they're demanding educational institutions

they're demanding governments

where sexism and sexual harassment and sexual assault are neither accepted

nor tolerated

Women around the world as we know

are raising their hands and saying Me Too

and it's a movement that's made so much more powerful

by the fact that women are standing together across industries

from domestic workers to celebrities in Hollywood

Women are marching we're sitting in

we're speaking up

Women are challenging the status quo

we're busting old taboos

and yes we are proudly making trouble

So women in Saudi Arabia are driving for the very first time

Applause and cheers

Women in Iraq are standing in solidarity with survivors of human trafficking

And women from El Salvador to Ireland are fighting for reproductive rights

And women in Myanmar are standing up for human rights

In short I think the most profound leadership in the world

isn't coming from halls of government

It's coming from women at the grassroots all across the globe

Applause

And here in the United States women are on fire

So a recent Kaiser poll reported

that since our last presidential election in 

one in five Americans have either marched or taken part in a protest

and the number one issue has been women's rights

Women are starting new organizations

they are volunteering on campaigns

and they're taking on every issue

from gunsafety reform to public education

And women are running for office in record numbers

and they are winning

So  Laughs

Applause

Women like Lucy McBath from Georgia

Applause and cheers

Lucy lost her son to gun violence

and it was because of her experience with the criminal justice system

that she realized just how broken it is

and she decided to do something about that

So she ran for office

and this January she's going to Congress

OK Or 
 
Applause

Angie Craig from Minnesota
Angie Craig
Applause and cheers

So her congressman had made such hateful comments about LGBTQ people
LGBTQ
that she decided to challenge him

And you know what She did and she won
 
and when she goes to Congress in January

she'll be the first lesbian mother serving in the House of Representatives

Applause and cheers

Or 

Applause

Or Lauren Underwood from Illinois

She's a registered nurse

and she sees every day the impact that lack of health care access has

on the community where she lives

and so she decided to run

She took on six men in her primary she beat them all

she won the general election

and when she goes to Congress in January

she's going to be the first AfricanAmerican woman ever

to serve her district in Washington DC

Applause and cheers

So women are recognizing 

this is our moment

Don't wait for permission

don't wait for your turn

As the late great Shirley Chisholm said 

Shirley Chisholm the first AfricanAmerican woman ever
Shirley Chisholm
to go to Congress

and the first woman to run for president in the Democratic party 

but Shirley Chisholm said
Shirley Chisholm
If there's no room for you at the table just pull up a folding chair

And that's what women are doing all across the country

I believe women are now the most important and powerful political force

in the world

but how do we make sure that this is not just a moment

What we need is actually a global movement for women's full equality

that is intersectional and it's intergenerational

where no one gets left behind

And so I have a few ideas about how we could do that

Number one it's not enough to resist

It's not enough to say what we're against

It's time to be loud and proud about what we are for

because being for full equality is a mainstream value

and something that we can get behind

Because actually men support equal pay for women

Millennials they support gender equality

And businesses are increasingly adopting familyfriendly policies

not just because it's the right thing to do

but because it's good for their workers

It's good for their business

Number two

We have to remember in the words of Fannie Lou Hamer
Fannie Lou Hamer
that nobody's free 'til everybody's free

So as I mentioned earlier

women of color in this country didn't even get the right to vote

until much further along than the rest of us

But since they did they are the most reliable voters

and women of color are the most reliable voters for candidates

who support women's rights

and we need to follow their lead 

Applause and cheers

Because their issues are our issues

And as white women we have to do more

because racism and sexism and homophobia

these are issues that affect all of us

Number three we've got to vote in every single election

Every election

And we've got to make it easier for folks to vote

and we've got to make sure that every single vote is counted OK

Applause and cheers

Because the barriers that exist to voting in the United States

they fall disproportionately on women 

women of color women with low incomes

women who are working and trying to raise a family

So we need to make it easier for everyone to vote

and we can start by making Election Day a federal holiday

in the United States of America

Applause and cheers

Number four don't wait for instructions

If you see a problem that needs fixing

I think you're the one to do it OK

So start a new organization run for office

Or maybe it's as simple as standing up on the job in support of yourself

or your coworkers

This is up to all of us

And number five invest in women all right

Applause

Invest in women as candidates as changemakers as leaders

Just as an example

in this last election cycle in the United States

women donated  million dollars more to candidates and campaigns

than they had just two years ago

and a record number of women won

So just think about that

Applause and cheers

So look sometimes I think that the challenges we face

they seem overwhelming

and they seem like they almost can never be solved

but I think the problems that seem the most intractable

are the ones that are most important to work on

And just because it hasn't been figured out yet doesn't mean you won't

After all if women's work were easy

someone else would have already been doing it right

Laughter

But women around the globe they're on the move

and they are taking strengths and inspiration from each other

They are doing things they never could have imagined

So if we could just take the progress we have made

in joining the workforce

in joining business

in joining the educational system

and actually channel that into building true political power

we will reshape this century

because one of us can be ignored

two of us can be dismissed

but together we're a movement

and we're unstoppable

Thank you

Applause and cheers

Thank you

Translator Ellen Maloney
Ellen Maloney
So sometimes I get angry

and it took me many years to be able to say just those words

In my work

sometimes my body thrums I'm so enraged

But no matter how justified my anger has been

throughout my life

I've always been led to understand that my anger is an exaggeration

a misrepresentation

that it will make me rude and unlikable

Mainly as a girl I learned as a girl that anger is an emotion

better left entirely unvoiced

Think about my mother for a minute

When I was  I came home from school one day

and she was standing on a long veranda outside of our kitchen

holding a giant stack of plates

Imagine how dumbfounded I was when she started to throw them like Frisbees

Laughter

into the hot humid air

When every single plate had shattered into thousands of pieces

on the hill below

she walked back in and she said to me cheerfully How was your day

Laughter

Now you can see how a child would look at an incident like this

and think that anger is silent isolating destructive even frightening

Especially though when the person who's angry is a girl or a woman

The question is why

Anger is a human emotion neither good nor bad

It is actually a signal emotion

It warns us of indignity threat insult and harm

And yet in culture after culture anger is reserved as the moral property

of boys and men

Now to be sure there are differences

So in the United States for example

an angry black man is viewed as a criminal

but an angry white man has civic virtue

Regardless of where we are however the emotion is gendered

And so we teach children to disdain anger in girls and women

and we grow up to be adults that penalize it

So what if we didn't do that

What if we didn't sever anger from femininity

Because severing anger from femininity means we sever girls and women

from the emotion that best protects us from injustice

What if instead we thought about developing emotional competence

for boys and girls

The fact is we still remarkably socialize children

in very binary and oppositional ways

Boys are held to absurd rigid norms of masculinity 

told to renounce the feminine emotionality of sadness or fear

and to embrace aggression and anger as markers of real manhood

On the other hand girls learn to be deferential

and anger is incompatible with deference

In the same way that we learned to cross our legs and tame our hair

we learned to bite our tongues and swallow our pride

What happens too often is that for all of us

indignity becomes imminent in our notions of femininity

There's a long personal and political tale to that bifurcation

In anger we go from being spoiled princesses and hormonal teens

to high maintenance women and shrill ugly nags

We have flavors though pick your flavor
 
Are you a spicy hot Latina when you're mad

Or a sad Asian girl An angry black woman Or a crazy white one
  
You can pick

But in fact the effect is that when we say what's important to us

which is what anger is conveying

people are more likely to get angry at us for being angry

Whether we're at home or in school or at work or in a political arena

anger confirms masculinity and it confounds femininity

So men are rewarded for displaying it

and women are penalized for doing the same

This puts us at an enormous disadvantage

particularly when we have to defend ourselves and our own interests

If we're faced with a threatening street harasser predatory employer

a sexist racist classmate

our brains are screaming Are you kidding me

And our mouths say I'm sorry what

Laughter

Right

And it's conflicting because the anger gets all tangled up

with the anxiety and the fear and the risk and retaliation

If you ask women what they fear the most in response to their anger

they don't say violence

They say mockery

Think about what that means

If you have multiple marginalized identities it's not just mockery

If you defend yourself if you put a stake in the ground

there can be dire consequences

Now we reproduce these patterns not in big bold and blunt ways

but in the everyday banality of life

When my daughter was in preschool every single morning

she built an elaborate castle  ribbons and blocks 

and every single morning the same boy knocked it down gleefully

His parents were there but they never intervened before the fact

They were happy to provide platitudes afterwards

Boys will be boys

It's so tempting he just couldn't help himself

I did what many girls and women learn to do

I preemptively kept the peace

and I taught my daughter to do the same thing

She used her words

She tried to gently body block him

She moved where she was building in the classroom to no effect

So I and the other adults mutually constructed a particular male entitlement

He could run rampant and control the environment

and she kept her feelings to herself and worked around his needs

We failed both of them by not giving her anger the uptake

and resolution that it deserved

Now that's a microcosm of a much bigger problem

Because culturally worldwide

we preference the performance of masculinity 

and the power and privilege that come with that performance 

over the rights and needs and words of children and women

So it will come as absolutely no surprise probably to the people in this room

that women report being angrier in more sustained ways and with more intensity

than men do

Some of that comes from the fact that we're socialized to ruminate

to keep it to ourselves and mull it over

But we also have to find socially palatable ways

to express the intensity of emotion that we have

and the awareness that it brings of our precarity

So we do several things

If men knew how often women were filled with white hot rage when we cried

they would be staggered

Laughter

We use minimizing language

We're frustrated No really it's OK

Laughter

We selfobjectify and lose the ability

to even recognize the physiological changes that indicate anger

Mainly though we get sick

Anger has now been implicated in a whole array of illnesses

that are casually dismissed as women's illnesses

Higher rates of chronic pain autoimmune disorders disordered eating

mental distress anxiety self harm depression

Anger affects our immune systems our cardiovascular systems

Some studies even indicate that it affects mortality rates

particularly in black women with cancer

I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired

Our anger brings great discomfort

and the conflict comes because it's our role to bring comfort

There is anger that's acceptable

We can be angry when we stay in our lanes and buttress the status quo

As mothers or teachers

we can be mad but we can't be angry about the tremendous costs of nurturing

We can be angry at our mothers

Let's say as teenagers  patriarchal rules and regulations 

we don't blame systems we blame them

We can be angry at other women because who doesn't love a good catfight

And we can be angry at men with lower status in an expressive hierarchy

that supports racism or xenophobia

But we have an enormous power in this

Because feelings are the purview of our authority

and people are uncomfortable with our anger

We should be making people comfortable with the discomfort they feel

when women say no unapologetically

We can take emotions and think in terms of competence and not gender

People who are able to process their anger and make meaning from it

are more creative more optimistic

they have more intimacy

they're better problem solvers

they have greater political efficacy

Now I am a woman writing about women and feelings

so very few men with power

are going to take what I'm saying seriously as a matter of politics

We think of politics and anger in terms of the contempt and disdain and fury

that are feeding a rise of machofascism in the world

But if it's that poison it's also the antidote

We have an anger of hope and we see it every single day

in the resistant anger of women and marginalized people

It's related to compassion and empathy and love

and we should recognize that anger as well

The issue is that societies that don't respect women's anger don't respect women

The real danger of our anger isn't that it will break bonds or plates

It's that it exactly shows how seriously we take ourselves

and we expect other people to take us seriously as well

When that happens chances are very good

that women will be able to smile when they want to

Thank you

I love learning foreign languages

In fact I love it so much that I like to learn a new language every two years

currently working on my eighth one

When people find that out about me they always ask me

How do you do that What's your secret
 
And to be honest for many years my answer would be

I don't know I simply love learning languages

But people were never happy with that answer

They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language

never achieving fluency

and here I come learning one language after another

They wanted to know the secret of polyglots

people who speak a lot of languages

And that made me wonder too

how do actually other polyglots do it

What do we have in common

And what is it that enables us

to learn languages so much faster than other people

I decided to meet other people like me and find that out

The best place to meet a lot of polyglots

is an event where hundreds of language lovers

meet in one place to practice their languages

There are several such polyglot events organized all around the world

and so I decided to go there

and ask polyglots about the methods that they use

And so I met Benny from Ireland

who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one

He learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook

and goes to meet native speakers

and starts having conversations with them right away

He doesn't mind making even  mistakes a day

because that's how he learns based on the feedback

And the best thing is he doesn't even need to travel a lot today

because you can easily have conversations with native speakers

from the comfort of your living room using websites

I also met Lucas from Brazil

who had a really interesting method to learn Russian

He simply added a hundred random Russian speakers on Skype as friends
Skype
and then he opened a chat window with one of them

and wrote Hi in Russian

And the person replied Hi how are you

Lucas copied this and put it into a text window with another person

and the person replied I'm fine thank you and how are you

Lucas copied this back to the first person

and in this way he had two strangers have a conversation with each other

without knowing about it

Laughter

And soon he would start typing himself

because he had so many of these conversations

that he figured out how the Russian conversation usually starts

What an ingenious method right

And then I met polyglots who always start by imitating sounds of the language

and others who always learn the  most frequent words of the language

and yet others who always start by reading about the grammar

If I asked a hundred different polyglots

I heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages

Everybody seems to have a unique way they learn a language

and yet we all come to the same result of speaking several languages fluently

And as I was listening to these polyglots telling me about their methods

it suddenly dawned on me

the one thing we all have in common

is that we simply found ways to enjoy the languagelearning process

All of these polyglots were talking about language learning

as if it was great fun

You should have seen their faces

when they were showing me their colorful grammar charts

and their carefully handmade flash cards

and their statistics about learning vocabulary using apps

or even how they love to cook based on recipes in a foreign language

All of them use different methods

but they always make sure it's something that they personally enjoy

I realized that this is actually how I learn languages myself

When I was learning Spanish I was bored with the text in the textbook

I mean who wants to read about Jose

asking about the directions to the train station Right

I wanted to read Harry Potter instead

because that was my favorite book as a child

and I have read it many times

So I got the Spanish translation of Harry Potter and started reading

and sure enough I didn't understand almost anything at the beginning

but I kept on reading because I loved the book

and by the end of the book I was able to follow it almost without any problems

And the same thing happened when I was learning German

I decided to watch Friends my favorite sitcom in German

and again at the beginning it was all just gibberish

I didn't know where one word finished and another one started

but I kept on watching every day because it's Friends

I can watch it in any language I love it so much

And after the second or third season

seriously the dialogue started to make sense

I only realized this after meeting other polyglots

We are no geniuses

and we have no shortcut to learning languages

We simply found ways how to enjoy the process

how to turn language learning from a boring school subject

into a pleasant activity which you don't mind doing every day

If you don't like writing words down on paper

you can always type them in an app

If you don't like listening to boring textbook material

find interesting content on YouTube or in podcasts for any language
YouTube
If you're a more introverted person

and you can't imagine speaking to native speakers right away

you can apply the method of selftalk

You can talk to yourself in the comfort of your room

describing your plans for the weekend how your day has been

or even take a random picture from your phone

and describe the picture to your imaginary friend

This is how polyglots learn languages

and the best news is it's available to anyone

who is willing to take the learning into their own hands

So meeting other polyglots helped me realize

that it is really crucial to find enjoyment

in the process of learning languages

but also that joy in itself is not enough

If you want to achieve fluency in a foreign language

you'll also need to apply three more principles

First of all you'll need effective methods

If you try to memorize a list of words for a test tomorrow

the words will be stored in your shortterm memory

and you'll forget them after a few days

If you however want to keep words long term

you need to revise them in the course of a few days repeatedly

using the socalled space repetition

You can use apps which are based on this system such as Anki or Memrise
AnkiMemrise
or you can write lists of word in a notebook using the Goldlist method
Goldlist
which is also very popular with many polyglots

If you're not sure which methods are effective and what is available out there

just check out polyglots' YouTube channels and websites
YouTube
and get inspiration from them

If it works for them it will most probably work for you too

The third principle to follow

is to create a system in your learning

We're all very busy and no one really has time to learn a language today

But we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead

Can you wake up  minutes earlier than you normally do

That would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary

Can you listen to a podcast on your way to work while driving

Well that would be great to get some listening experience

There are so many things we can do without even planning that extra time

such as listening to podcasts on our way to work

or doing our household chores

The important thing is to create a plan in the learning

I will practice speaking every Tuesday and Thursday

with a friend for  minutes

I will listen to a YouTube video while having breakfast
YouTube
If you create a system in your learning

you don't need to find that extra time

because it will become a part of your everyday life

And finally if you want to learn a language fluently

you need also a bit of patience

It's not possible to learn a language within two months

but it's definitely possible to make a visible improvement in two months

if you learn in small chunks every day in a way that you enjoy

And there is nothing that motivates us more

than our own success

I vividly remember the moment

when I understood the first joke in German when watching Friends

I was so happy and motivated

that I just kept on watching that day two more episodes

and as I kept watching

I had more and more of those moments of understanding these little victories

and step by step I got to a level where I could use the language

freely and fluently to express anything

This is a wonderful feeling

I can't get enough of that feeling

and that's why I learn a language every two years

So this is the whole polyglot secret

Find effective methods which you can use systematically

over the period of some time in a way which you enjoy

and this is how polyglots learn languages within months not years

Now some of you may be thinking

That's all very nice to enjoy language learning

but isn't the real secret that you polyglots

are just super talented and most of us aren't

Well there's one thing I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas

Benny had  years of Irish Gaelic and five years of German at school

He couldn't speak them at all when graduating

Up to the age of  he thought he didn't have the language gene

and he could not speak another language

Then he started to look for his way of learning languages

which was speaking to native speakers and getting feedback from them

and today Benny can easily have a conversation in  languages

Lucas tried to learn English at school for  years

He was one of the worst students in class

His friends even made fun of him

and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke

because they thought he would never learn that language or any language

And then Lucas started to experiment with methods

looking for his own way to learn

for example by having Skype chat conversations with strangers
Skype
And after just  years

Lucas is able to speak  languages fluently

Does that sound like a miracle

Well I see such miracles every single day

As a language mentor

I help people learn languages by themselves

and I see this every day

People struggle with language learning for five  even  years

and then they suddenly take their learning into their own hands

start using materials which they enjoy more effective methods

or they start tracking their learning

so that they can appreciate their own progress

and that's when suddenly

they magically find the language talent that they were missing all their lives

So if you've also tried to learn a language

and you gave up thinking it's too difficult

or you don't have the language talent

give it another try

Maybe you're also just one enjoyable method away

from learning that language fluently

Maybe you're just one method away from becoming a polyglot

Thank you

Computers used to be as big as a room

But now they fit in your pocket

on your wrist

and can even be implanted inside of your body

How cool is that

And this has been enabled by the miniaturization of transistors

which are the tiny switches in the circuits

at the heart of our computers

And it's been achieved through decades of development

and breakthroughs in science and engineering

and of billions of dollars of investment

But it's given us vast amounts of computing

huge amounts of memory

and the digital revolution that we all experience and enjoy today

But the bad news is

we're about to hit a digital roadblock

as the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down

And this is happening at exactly the same time

as our innovation in software is continuing relentlessly

with artificial intelligence and big data

And our devices regularly perform facial recognition or augment our reality

or even drive cars down our treacherous chaotic roads

It's amazing

But if we don't keep up with the appetite of our software

we could reach a point in the development of our technology

where the things that we could do with software could in fact be limited

by our hardware

We've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet

grinding slowly to a halt over time

under the everincreasing weight of software updates and new features

And it worked just fine when we bought it not so long ago

But the hungry software engineers have eaten up all the hardware capacity

over time

The semiconductor industry is very well aware of this

and is working on all sorts of creative solutions

such as going beyond transistors to quantum computing

or even working with transistors in alternative architectures

such as neural networks

to make more robust and efficient circuits

But these approaches will take quite some time

and we're really looking for a much more immediate solution to this problem

The reason why the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down

is due to the everincreasing complexity of the manufacturing process

The transistor used to be a big bulky device

until the invent of the integrated circuit

based on pure crystalline silicon wafers

And after  years of continuous development

we can now achieve transistor features dimensions

down to  nanometers

You can fit more than a billion transistors

in a single square millimeter of silicon

And to put this into perspective

a human hair is  microns across

A red blood cell which is essentially invisible

is eight microns across

and you can place  across the width of a human hair

But a transistor in comparison is much smaller

at a tiny fraction of a micron across

You could place more than  transistors

across a single red blood cell

or more than  across the width of a human hair

It really is incredible nanotechnology in your pocket right now

And besides the obvious benefit

of being able to place more smaller transistors on a chip

smaller transistors are faster switches

and smaller transistors are also more efficient switches

So this combination has given us

lower cost higher performance and higher efficiency electronics

that we all enjoy today

To manufacture these integrated circuits

the transistors are built up layer by layer

on a pure crystalline silicon wafer

And in an oversimplified sense

every tiny feature of the circuit is projected

onto the surface of the silicon wafer

and recorded in a lightsensitive material

and then etched through the lightsensitive material

to leave the pattern in the underlying layers

And this process has been dramatically improved over the years

to give the electronics performance we have today

But as the transistor features get smaller and smaller

we're really approaching the physical limitations

of this manufacturing technique

The latest systems for doing this patterning

have become so complex

that they reportedly cost more than  million dollars each

And semiconductor factories contain dozens of these machines

So people are seriously questioning Is this approach longterm viable

But we believe we can do this chip manufacturing

in a totally different and much more costeffective way

using molecular engineering and mimicking nature

down at the nanoscale dimensions of our transistors

As I said the conventional manufacturing takes every tiny feature of the circuit

and projects it onto the silicon

But if you look at the structure of an integrated circuit

the transistor arrays

many of the features are repeated millions of times

It's a highly periodic structure

So we want to take advantage of this periodicity

in our alternative manufacturing technique

We want to use selfassembling materials

to naturally form the periodic structures

that we need for our transistors

We do this with the materials

then the materials do the hard work of the fine patterning

rather than pushing the projection technology to its limits and beyond

Selfassembly is seen in nature in many different places

from lipid membranes to cell structures

so we do know it can be a robust solution

If it's good enough for nature it should be good enough for us

So we want to take this naturally occurring robust selfassembly

and use it for the manufacturing of our semiconductor technology

One type of selfassemble material 

it's called a block copolymer 

consists of two polymer chains just a few tens of nanometers in length

But these chains hate each other

They repel each other

very much like oil and water or my teenage son and daughter

Laughter

But we cruelly bond them together

creating an inbuilt frustration in the system

as they try to separate from each other

And in the bulk material there are billions of these

and the similar components try to stick together

and the opposing components try to separate from each other

at the same time

And this has a builtin frustration a tension in the system

So it moves around it squirms until a shape is formed

And the natural selfassembled shape that is formed is nanoscale

it's regular it's periodic and it's long range

which is exactly what we need for our transistor arrays

So we can use molecular engineering

to design different shapes of different sizes

and of different periodicities

So for example if we take a symmetrical molecule

where the two polymer chains are similar length

the natural selfassembled structure that is formed

is a long meandering line

very much like a fingerprint

And the width of the fingerprint lines

and the distance between them

is determined by the lengths of our polymer chains

but also the level of builtin frustration in the system

And we can even create more elaborate structures

if we use unsymmetrical molecules

where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other

And the selfassembled structure that forms in this case

is with the shorter chains forming a tight ball in the middle

and it's surrounded by the longer opposing polymer chains

forming a natural cylinder

And the size of this cylinder

and the distance between the cylinders the periodicity

is again determined by how long we make the polymer chains

and the level of builtin frustration

So in other words we're using molecular engineering

to selfassemble nanoscale structures

that can be lines or cylinders the size and periodicity of our design

We're using chemistry chemical engineering

to manufacture the nanoscale features that we need for our transistors

But the ability to selfassemble these structures

only takes us half of the way

because we still need to position these structures

where we want the transistors in the integrated circuit

But we can do this relatively easily

using wide guide structures that pin down the selfassembled structures

anchoring them in place

and forcing the rest of the selfassembled structures

to lie parallel

aligned with our guide structure

For example if we want to make a fine nanometer line

which is very difficult to manufacture with conventional projection technology

we can manufacture a nanometer guide structure

with normal projection technology

and this structure will align three of the nanometer lines in between

So the materials are doing the most difficult fine patterning

And we call this whole approach directed selfassembly

The challenge with directed selfassembly

is that the whole system needs to align almost perfectly

because any tiny defect in the structure could cause a transistor failure

And because there are billions of transistors in our circuit

we need an almost molecularly perfect system

But we're going to extraordinary measures

to achieve this

from the cleanliness of our chemistry

to the careful processing of these materials

in the semiconductor factory

to remove even the smallest nanoscopic defects

So directed selfassembly is an exciting new disruptive technology

but it is still in the development stage

But we're growing in confidence that we could in fact introduce it

to the semiconductor industry

as a revolutionary new manufacturing process

in just the next few years

And if we can do this if we're successful

we'll be able to continue

with the costeffective miniaturization of transistors

continue with the spectacular expansion of computing

and the digital revolution

And what's more this could even be the dawn of a new era

of molecular manufacturing

How cool is that

Thank you

Paula Stone Williams So I was the CEO of a large religious nonprofit

spoke at some of the largest churches in America

was on television in  different markets

but more than anything else

I just wanted to be a good parent

I told all three of my children

When the going gets tough

you have to choose the road less traveled

the narrow path

I had no idea how difficult that was going to become

I knew from the time I was three or four years of age

that I was transgender

I knew if I came out I would lose everything

But the call toward authenticity is sacred

and for the greater good

and it asks you to trust that the truth not only sets you free

it will set everyone free

I decided to stake my life on it

So I came out

Turns out if you spend most of your life

working in the conservative religious world

coming out as transgender is not all that great for your career

Laughter

Who knew

Laughter

Within seven days I lost every single one of my jobs

My family was supportive but struggling

Most of my friends and coworkers had rejected me

the rest were confused

One friend said You really messed with me

I said Yeah well get in line

They said You were my only example of an alpha male who was gentle

And I thought Oh You're right

I was an alpha male

And I was gentle

And if it was hard for him

how much more difficult was it for my own son

Jonathan Williams Estrangement was not an option
Jonathan Williams
It was Father's Day and my girls brought me craft beer

and a homemade jar of pickles which in my estimation

is the perfect Father's Day gift

Laughter

But the question remained

Do I call my own father

To call him and I continue down this spiral of denial

pretending that my dad was still 

well my dad

To not call was to acknowledge that everything had changed

It meant that I was in for years of pain and mourning and sadness

but ultimately hope for reconciliation

There's no playbook for when one's father of  plus years decides to transition

to the female gender

But my dad did teach me one thing

He said the road to redemption always comes from choosing the narrow path

And so I decided not to call that day

and a few months later Paula flew out and met me at a hotel in New York

my wife and I

I knocked on the door and this woman answered

It definitely wasn't my dad

It's good to see you she said

It didn't sound like my dad either

We went to lunch and the waiter came to take our order

He said Let's start with the ladies

but there was only one lady at the table and it was my wife

and  oh my God there are two women at the table

And my dad ordered something like lettuce

and I was like I have fries on my plate

Did my dad like fries I don't remember
 
I think he liked them

But she wasn't eating them

Here's this woman who knew everything about me

and I knew nothing about her

I don't even remember saying goodbye

PSW All I could think about that day
PSW
was that it was late September in New York

and I was wearing white jeans

Laughter

You don't wear white after Labor Day in New York

There was a knock at the door

and all I could think about was here I stand in my wrong jeans

And then I saw these big blue eyes I love so much

and they were staring back at me in disbelief

And I thought Oh this is not going to be easy

When one person in a family transitions

the entire family transitions whether they want to or not

Now for those on the fringes it was easy

The liberals said Oh wonderful

She's found her truth how delightful

And the conservatives said That's messed up I'm out of here

Laughter

But for my family neither extreme was going to work

Their anger their hurt

their love and loyalty 

all of it had to be brought on to the road of trials

JW Was it all a lie
JW
Every game of catch in the front yard the Mets season tickets 

was that with my dad or was that with her

I remember this one time

my dad took me on a bike ride through Heckscher Park

to teach me about sex

He explained the parts of the body that I now know he wished weren't hers

Had my father ever even existed

Now grief 

grief is without rules

Grief borrows your car without asking

wrecks it

and then doesn't apologize

And I was a wreck

This was heavy

I retreated into myself

I was angry

I felt betrayed

And I guess I should have known

by the fact that you encouraged me to be a Mets fan

that you were preparing me for life's really big disappointments

Laughter

That's true

And yet there were the games of catch

and there were the season tickets

and bacon egg and cheese sandwiches every Saturday

from the best bagel place on Long Island

My father lived this life he didn't want to live

but he lived it so that I could have a dad

I stopped wondering if my dad had ever existed

He had existed  willfully consciously intentionally 

each and every day of my growing up

For that I was thankful

Paula's body was hers now and her transformation was complete

but my transformation was just beginning

I had another trial another journey another choice to heed my father's advice

and continue down that narrow path

PSW So most days I believe there is a God
PSW
Tuesdays and Thursdays can be tough

and any day that you're on the New Jersey Turnpike

I mean really you know

Laughter

It's hard to believe in God when your soul is in the wrong body

Still somehow I ended up in ministry

When I lost all my jobs it was nothing personal

It's what religious tribes do

They believe an enemy is necessary for the tribe to survive

so where no enemy exists

they create one

Right now sexual minorities are the enemy

my departure was swift and sure

I was surprised when my son left his job teaching in West Philadelphia

to go into the ministry

I did not see that one coming

And now I wondered

What would he do

I didn't have to wait that long to find an answer

Six months after that first visit

he invited me back to New York

JW The designers of the Brooklyn Bridge
JW
they had their share of bad luck

John Roebling he died shortly after the bridge's construction began
John Roebling
His son Washington took over

but he suffered from decompression sickness

His wife Emily became the surrogate executive engineer

who oversaw the bridge's completion

Father and son

John and Washington

done in by their work

It was this sunny day in May

and my father and I sat in the shadow of that Brooklyn Bridge

Would our lives follow the Roeblings' 

father and son done in by our work

My father thought that her friends in church

would carry her through her transition

and they did not

They ditched her and they clung to me

I was the pastor of a new church in Brooklyn

This wonderful group of forwardthinking people

and yet we were financially tied to really conservative churches

To hold space for Paula meant jeopardizing our own church's livelihood

I sort of straddled the line between these warring worlds

So I said to my dad

Dad I still live and work in your old world

Is it possible that you might extend an olive branch for my sake

And her response was impassioned

You said to me Do you have any idea what it feels like

to finally show yourself to your true friends

and have them completely reject you

To ask you to live a lie

Do you know what that feels like

And I didn't know what that felt like

But I knew I had a decision to make

It was the decision to continue down that narrow path through nights

but for the first time

I caught a glimpse of light

I cannot ask my father to be anything other than her true self

Applause

PSW So as we sat by the river that day

Jonathan talked about his pain his suffering his grief his confusion

He brought all of himself to that conversation

and it tore at me

to be the cause of such pain

But as he talked there was something redemptive going on

full of tension but possibility

grounded in that narrow path

He said This is always going to be hard

It always will be

But Dad

I love you

My son is the best of me and more

He's bold and strong

sensitive and thoughtful

I guess you could say

he's an alpha male who's gentle

JW It was time for my daughters to meet their  Paula
JW
We went back to my apartment

and my daughters were coloring at the dining room table

and there was this awkward silence

And finally my youngest asked a single confident question

So Grandpa do you have a penis

Laughter

And after the tension abated and the laughter subsided

my girls took their grandpa back into their room

and showed her their new toys

and they christened her with a new name

They called her GrandPaula

Laughter

PSW So this past summer I had all five of my granddaughters at my home
PSW
there in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains

We went swimming in the cool waters of the river

that flows through our little town

And one day one of Jonathan's girls said to me

GrandPaula can we go tubing on the river

And I said Well you know

I'd really wait until your daddy gets here for that

That feels to me like that ought to be his call

And she said Oh but GrandPaula

he'll exactly make the same decision you would

He's a lot like you you know

Laughter

And I thought yeah he is a lot like me

both of us determined to find the narrow path

and follow it through the long dark night

all the way to the light of dawn

JW Have you ever noticed that a child who is secure
JW
a child who knows love

that child will dance

They wave their arms

they kick their legs to music that only they can hear

It's the music of a child who is safe and unharmed

and wholly loved

The day after my children met their GrandPaula

she took them to go get doughnuts

and I watched as they walked down the street

and my girls took my father's arms

and they danced

My father's arms swung wildly

You bought them one too many doughnuts because you always do 

Laughter

I watched my older daughter take a bite of her doughnut

and she unleashed two jumps and a twirl

It was perfect

That narrow path

it always has its share of burdens and challenges

But I was certain that we were going to see this through to redemption

I looked at my dad

and I looked at my girls who were dancing and eating their doughnuts

and I said aloud to no one in particular

I said This 

this is how God sees my dad

My father was literally born again

And by choosing the narrow path of redemption

I was born again with her

Thank you

Applause and cheers

In our culture we tend to see sex

as something that's more important to men than it is to women

But that's not true

What is true is that women often feel more shame in talking about it

Over half of women quietly suffer from some kind of sexual dysfunction

We've been hearing more about the orgasm gap

It's kind of like the wage gap but stickier 

Laughter

Straight women tend to reach climax

less than  percent of the time they have sex

Men reach climax  percent of the time they have sex

To address these issues women have been sold flawed medication

testosterone creams 

even untested genital injections

The thing is female sexuality can't be fixed with a pill

That's because it's not broken

it's misunderstood

Our culture has had a skewed and medically incorrect picture

of female sexuality

going back centuries

If over half of women have some kind of sexual problem

maybe our idea of sexuality doesn't work for women

We need a clearer understanding of how women actually work

I'm a journalist

and I recently wrote a book

about how our understanding of female sexuality is evolving

So sexuality itself was defined back when men dominated science

Male scientists tended to see the female body

through their own skewed lens

They could've just asked women about their experience

Instead they probed the female body like it was a foreign landscape

Even today we debate the existence of female ejaculation and the Gspot
G
like we're talking about aliens or UFOs

Are they really out there

Laughter

All this goes double for LGBTQI women's sexuality
LGBTQI
which has been hated and erased in specific ways

Ignorance about the female body goes back centuries

It goes back to the beginning of modern medicine

Cast your mind back to the th century

a time of scientific revolution in Europe

Men of ideas were challenging old dogmas

They were building telescopes to gaze up at the stars

We were making progress 

sometimes

You see the fathers of anatomy 

and I say fathers because let's face it they were all dudes 

were poking about between women's legs

and trying to classify what they saw

They weren't quite sure what to do with the clitoris

It didn't appear to have anything to do with making babies

The leading anatomist at the time declared

that it was probably some kind of abnormal growth 

Laughter

and that any woman who had one was probably a hermaphrodite

It got so bad that parents would sometimes have their daughter's clitoris cut off

if it was deemed too large

That's right

Something we think of today as female genital mutilation

was practiced in the West as late as the th century

You have to wonder

if they were that confused about women's bodies

why didn't they just ask women for a little help

But you must be thinking All that was history

It's a different world now

Women have everything

They have the birth control pill

they have sexting and Tinder and vajazzling
Tinder
Laughter

Things must be better now

But medical ignorance of the female body continues

How many of you recognize this

It's the full structure of the clitoris

We think of the clitoris as this little peasized nub

but actually it extends deep into the body

Most of it lies under the skin

It contains almost as much erectile tissue as the penis

It's beautiful isn't it

It looks a little like a swan

Laughter

This sculpture is by an artist named Sophia Wallace

as part of her Cliteracy project

Laughter

She believes we need more cliteracy

and it's true considering that this structure

was only fully D mapped by researchers in 

That was after we finished mapping the entire human genome

Laughter

This ignorance has reallife consequences

In a medical journal in 

Dr Helen O'Connell a urologist

warned her colleagues that this structure was still nowhere to be found

in basic medical journals 

textbooks like Gray's Anatomy
Gray's Antomatics
This could have serious consequences for surgery

Take this in

Gentlemen

imagine if you were at risk of losing your penis

because doctors weren't totally sure where it was

or what it looked like

Unsurprisingly

many women aren't too clear on their own genital anatomy either

You can't really blame them

The clitoris is often missing from many sexed diagrams too

Women can sense that their culture views their bodies with confusion at best

outright disdain and disgust at worst

Many women still view their own genitals as dirty or inadequate

They're increasingly comparing their vulvas

with the neat and tiny ones they see in pornography

It's one reason why labiaplasty is becoming a skyrocketing business

among women and teen girls

Some people feel that all this is a trivial issue

I was writing my book when I was at a dinner party

and someone said Isn't sexuality a firstworld problem

Aren't women dealing with more important issues all over the world

Of course they are

But I think the impulse to trivialize sex is part of our problem

We live in a culture that seems obsessed with sex

We use it to sell everything

We tell women that looking sexy

is one of the most important things you can do

But what we really do is we belittle sex

We reduce it to a sad shadow of what it truly is

Sex is more than just an act

I spoke with Dr Lori Brotto

a psychologist who treats sexual issues in women

including survivors of trauma

She says the hundreds of women she sees all tend to repeat the same thing

They say I don't feel whole

They feel they've lost a connection with their partners and themselves

So what is sex

We've traditionally defined the act of sex

as a linear goaloriented process

It's something that starts with lust

continues to heavy petting

and finishes with a happy ending

Except many women don't experience it this way

It's less linear for them and more circular

This is a new model of women's arousal and desire

developed by Dr Rosemary Basson
Rosemary Basson
It says many things

including that women can begin an encounter for many different reasons

that aren't desire

like curiosity

They can finish with a climax or multiple climaxes

or satisfaction without a climax at all

All options are normal

Some people are starting to champion a richer definition of sexuality

Whether you identify as male female or neither gender

sex is about our relationship to the senses

It's about slowing down

listening to the body

coming into the present moment

It's about our whole health and wellbeing

In other words

sex at its true breadth isn't profane

it's sacred

That's one reason why women are redefining their sexuality today

They're asking What is sex for me

So they're experimenting with practices that are less about the happy ending 

more about feeling whole

So they're trying out spiritual sex classes

masturbation workshops 

even shooting their own porn

that celebrates the diversity of real bodies

For anyone who still feels this is a trivial issue consider this

understanding your body is crucial to the huge issue

of sex education and consent

By deeply intimately knowing what kind of touch feels right

what pressure what speed what context

you can better know what kind of touch feels wrong

and have the confidence to say so

This isn't ultimately about women having more or better sex

It's not about making sure women have as many orgasms as men

It's about accepting yourself and your own unique experience

It's about you being the expert on your body

It's about defining pleasure and satisfaction on your terms

And if that means you're happiest having no sex at all

that's perfect too

If we define sex as part of our whole health and wellbeing

then empowering women and girls to fully own it

is a crucial next step toward equality

And I think it would be a better world not just for women

but for everyone

Thank you

I have a vagina

Laughter

Just thought you should know

That might not come as a surprise to some of you

I look like a woman

I'm dressed like one I guess

The thing is I also have balls

And it does take a lot of nerve

to come up here and talk to you about my genitalia

Just a little

But I'm not talking about bravery or courage

I mean literally  I have balls

Right here

right where a lot of you have ovaries

I'm not male or female

I'm intersex

Most people assume that you're biologically either a man or a woman

but it's actually a lot more complex than that

There are so many ways somebody could be intersex

In my case it means I was born with XY chromosomes
XY
which you probably know as male chromosomes

And I was born with a vagina and balls inside my body

I don't respond to testosterone

so during puberty I grew breasts

but I never got acne or body hair body oil

You can be jealous of that

Laughter

But even though I don't actually have a uterus 

I was born without one

so I don't menstruate I can't have biological children

We put people in boxes based on their genitalia

Before a baby's even born we ask whether it's a boy or a girl

as if it actually matters

as if you're going to be less excited about having a baby

if it doesn't have the genitals you wanted

as if what's between somebody's legs tells you anything about that person

Are they kind generous funny

Smart

Who do they want to be when they grow up

Genitals don't actually tell you anything

Yet we define ourselves by them

In this society we love putting people into boxes

and labeling each other

It kind of gives us a sense of belonging

and teaches us how to interact with one another

But there's one really big problem

biological sex is not black or white

It's on a spectrum

Besides your genitalia you also have your chromosomes

your gonads like ovaries or testicles

You have your internal sex organs

your hormone production your hormone response

and your secondary sex characteristics like breast development body hair etc

Those seven areas of biological sex all have so much variation

yet we only get two options

male or female

Which is kind of absurd to me

because I can't think of a single other human trait

that there's only two options for

skin color hair height eyes

You can either have nose A or nose B that's it no other options
AB
If there are infinite ways for our bodies to look

our minds to think

personalities to act

wouldn't it make sense that there's that much variety

in biological sex too

Did you know that besides XX or XY chromosomes
XXXY
you could have XX and XY chromosomes
XXXY
Or you could have an extra X  XXY
XXXY
Or two extra  XXXY
XXXY
Goes on from there

And for those normal people with XX or XY
XXXY
what does that mean

I have XY chromosomes
XY
If my DNA is found at the scene of a crime 
DNA
not saying it will but you know we'll see

Laughter

If my skeleton is discovered thousands of years from now

I'll be labeled male

Is that the truth

My balls would say so

But what about the rest of me

And what if a woman has ovarian cancer and has to have her ovaries removed

Does she still qualify as a woman

What about other intersex people who are born without balls or ovaries

or with just one or a combination of the two

Where do they go

Do you have to have a uterus to be a woman

There's a lot of us who are born without one

And everyone's favorite part genitalia

you either have one or the other right

You either have a sixinchlong penis that's exactly this thick

jutting straight out of the body at a degree angle

or you have a vagina that's this wide internally

and a clitoris that's half an inch above the vaginal opening

and labia that look exactly like they're supposed to look like

according to that one porn video you watched that one time

You know the one

If you've been with more than one sexual partner in your lifetime

and you line them up one by one

I guarantee you can identify them just by their genitalia

Laughter

Think about it

Go on

Laughter

I see you

No judging

Just notice

All different right

The sex and gender binary are both so ingrained in our society

that we never stop to think about it

We just automatically place each other into one box or the other

as if it actually matters

Until somebody comes along to make you question it

And if you're thinking that I'm the exception an anomaly an outlier

intersex people represent around two percent of the population

That's the same percentage as genetic redheads

It's about  million people roughly

which is more than the entire population of Russia

So there's a lot of us needless to say

We're not new or rare

We're just invisible

We've existed throughout every culture in history

Yet we never talk about it

In fact a lot of people might not know that they're intersex

Have you had a karyotype test to determine your chromosomes

What about a full blood panel for all of your hormone levels

A friend of mine found out last year in his s

The executive director of interACT

which is the leading organization for intersex human rights here in the US

she found out she was intersex at age 

Her doctors found out when she was 

but they didn't tell her

They lied and said that she had cancer

because that seemed like an easier option

than finding out she wasn't fully a woman

This kind of thing happens a lot

where intersex people are lied to or kept in the dark about our bodies

which comes as a surprise to a lot of people

But we live in a society that doesn't talk about sex or bodies at all

unless it's to mock or shame each other

I found out I was intersex at age 

and for the most part I was fine with that information

It didn't really faze me

I was still developing my understanding of the world

It wasn't until I got older

and realized I didn't fit society's expectations of me

that I didn't belong that I was abnormal

And that's when the shame started

How many times have you seen kids play with the wrong toys

for their gender

Or try on the wrong clothes

All the time right

Kids don't have these ideas about gender norm

they don't have shame about who they're supposed to be

or what they're supposed to like or love

They don't care about any of this stuff

They don't have shame until we put it on them

I also had doctors lie to me

At age  they told me that I would also get cancer

unless I removed my balls

Then they proceeded to tell me that every year

Until today there are still doctors who want me to remove them

But there's literally no reason

If a typical XY male like yourself has testicles
XY
and one is undescended

there's a high chance of it becoming cancerous 

or a higher chance of it becoming cancerous

They need to thermoregulated

So they drop down away from the body to cool off

or they shrink back up to get warm

Mine don't need to do that

They're not responding to testosterone they're not producing sperm

They're fine right here inside my body

Yet because there's such a lack of information about intersex people

my doctors never understood the difference

They never really understood my body

As I got older

I had another doctor tell me that I needed to have surgery on my vagina

She said that until I had an operation until she operated

I would not be able to have normal sex with my husband one day

Her words

I didn't end up going through with the operation

and I'm incredibly grateful for that

I'm not here to talk about my sex life

Laughter

But let's just say it's fine

Laughter

I'm fine my body is fine

You actually wouldnt be able to tell the difference

between me and another person unless I told you

you wouldn't be able to tell that I was intersex unless I told you

But again because of the lack of understanding about bodies

my doctor didn't understand the difference

And for the most part my sex life is fine

The only issue that really comes up

is that sometimes sexual situations bring up memories of doctors touching me

over and over again since I was 

I've been really lucky to escape 

I didn't think I would get emotional 

I've been really lucky to escape the physical harm

that comes from these unnecessary surgeries

But no intersex person is free from the emotional harm

that comes from living in a society that tries to cover up your existence

Most of my intersex friends have had operations like these

Oftentimes they will remove testes like mine

even though my risk of testicular cancer is lower than the risk of breast cancer

in a typical woman with no predisposition no family history

But we don't tell her to remove her breasts do we

It's rare to meet an intersex person that hasn't been operated on

Oftentimes these surgeries are done to improve intersex kids' lives

but they usually end up doing the opposite

causing more harm and complications

both physical and emotional

I'm not saying that doctors are bad or evil

It's just that we live in a society that causes some doctors to fix

those of us who don't fit their definition of normal

We're not problems that need to be fixed

We just live in a society that needs to be enlightened

One of the ways I'm doing that

is by creating a genderless puberty guidebook

that can teach kids about their bodies as they grow up

Not their girl bodies or their boy bodies 

just their bodies

We often place unrealistic expectations on the things that our bodies do

that are outside of our control

I mean if one man can grow a full luxurious hipster beard

and the other can only grow a few mustache hairs

what does that mean about who they are as men

Nothing

It literally most likely just means

that their hair follicles respond to testosterone in different ways

Yet how many times have you heard a man ashamed about something like this

Imagine a world where we could live in a society

that teaches us not to have shame

about the things that our bodies do or do not do

I want to change the way that we think about biological sex in this society 

which is a lot to ask for

You could say it's ballsy I guess

Laughter

But eventually we accepted the world as round right

We no longer diagnose gay people with mental disorders

or women with hysteria

We don't think epilepsy is caused by the devil anymore so that's cool

Laughter

We constantly change and evolve the more we understand as a society

And biological sex is on a spectrum

It's not black or white

Not only could that knowledge save intersex kids

from physical and emotional harm

I think it would help everyone else too

Who here has ever felt inadequate or ashamed

because you weren't girly enough you were too girly

you weren't manly enough or too manly

We constantly shame people for not fitting into a box

but the reality is

I think we shame others because it prevents them from seeing

that we don't fit inside our boxes either

And the truth is that nobody actually fits in a box

because they don't exist

This binary this false malefemale facade is something we constructed

we built ourselves

But it doesn't have to exist

We can break it down

And that's what I want to do

Will you join me

Thanks

Applause

I can't think of anyone who just has one interest in life

and that's all they want to do for the rest of their life

[The Way We Work]
[]
Around  percent of American workers don't have traditional fulltime jobs

They're halftime parttime contract workers or temps

The term side hustle just seems to fit with this ethos

where people are putting together a few different things to make a living

The word side hustle has its roots in popular African American newspapers

In the s these papers used the word hustle
hush
to refer to some kind of scam

By the s they were using side hustle

to refer to legitimate work too

A side hustle is a little different than a second job

A second job is about necessity

While a side hustle can certainly bring in extra income

it's a little more aspirational

Side hustle captures a certain kind of scrappy entrepreneurial spirit

I've interviewed more than  women of color

on Side Hustle Pro

who started successful side hustles

Nailah EllisBrown started Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk

Arsha Jones started her famous Capital City Co Mambo Sauce
Arsha JonesMambo
with one product and a PayPal link

All these women are running side hustles

What exactly does this tell us

First that people are seeing opportunity within their communities

The goal here isn't necessarily to be the next CocaCola or Google

Scale is great but there's also beauty in a successful business

that's built for a specific audience

Second people are increasingly interested in being their own boss

Being your own boss takes discipline

Selfmade millionaires tend to have one big trait in common

they make decisions hold themselves accountable

and push through in the face of challenges

A side hustle is a great way to try out being your own boss

and see if you have those skills before fully stepping out on your own

Third people are multipassionate

I want to stress that not every side hustle is started

because someone hates their job

Many are started simply because people are interested

in lots of different things

Lisa Price who started a hair and beauty company Carol's Daughter

was working in television production when she started sidehustling

She says she actually loved her job

It was the fact that she came home every day feeling good

that led her to start experimenting

with making fragrances and hair oils in her kitchen

We're always being taught

that we're supposed to know what we want to do when we grow up

But when you're multipassionate

you want to dip and dabble in those different things

It doesn't mean that you're not committed to your job

it just means that you have other outlets that bring you joy

And that brings me to the final thing the side hustle revolution shows us

people want to make a bet on themselves

Side hustles are appealing because it's easier to take that chance

when you have some kind of income coming in

Even if a side hustle doesn't take off

it's still an investment in yourself

Fortyone percent of millennials who have a side hustle

say they've shared this information with their employers

They're not worried about their managers reacting negatively

They recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hustle

Everyone is looking to feel fulfilled

Thirtyeight percent of baby boomers feel some kind of regret about their career

No one wants that

The truth is that there are many different ways to find happiness

through what we do

Side hustles are about embracing that hope

that we can be the ones making the decisions

in how we spend our work lives

Have you ever watched a flock of birds work together

Thousands of animals flying in perfect synchrony

Isn't it fascinating

What I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that

if they all would have to follow one leader

Their reaction speed would simply be too low

Instead scientists believe that these birds are relying on

a few simple rules

allowing every single bird to make autonomous decisions

while still flying in perfect synchrony

Their alignment enables their autonomy

and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible

Now what does this have to do with any one of us

Well it's one way of illustrating what I believe to be the most important change

that is needed in ways of working today

The world is getting faster and more complex

so we need a new way of working

a way that creates alignment around purpose

that takes out bureaucracy

and that truly empowers people to make decisions faster

But the question is

In order to get there

what are we willing to give up

A few years ago I was working with a bank

that wanted to embark on a digital transformation

They wanted their offering to be simpler more intuitive more relevant

Now I'm not sure how many of you have seen a bank from the inside

so let me try to illustrate what many traditional banks look like

You see lots of people in suits

taking elevators to go to their department

marketers sitting with marketers engineers with engineers etc

You see meetings with  people

where nothing gets decided

Great ideas They end up in PowerPoint parking lots
 PowerPoint
And there are endless handovers between departments

Getting anything done can take forever

So this bank knew that in order to transform

they would have to improve their time to market

by drastically changing their ways of working as well

But how

To get some inspiration we decided to go and have a look at companies

that seem to be more innovative

like Google Netflix Spotify Zappos
NetflixSpotifyZappos
And I remember how we were walking the halls at one of these companies

in December 

a management consultant and a team of bankers

We felt like strangers in a strange land

surrounded by beanbags and hoodies

and lots of smart creative employees

So then we asked How is your company organized

And we expected to get an org chart

But instead they used strange drawings

with funny names like squads and chapters and tribes

to explain how they were organized

So then we tried to translate that to our own world

We asked How many people are working for you

It depends

Who do you report to

It depends

Who decides on your priorities

It depends

You can imagine our surprise

We were asking for what we thought were some of the basic principles

of organizations

and their answer was It depends

Now over the course of that day

we gained a better understanding of their model

They believed in the power of small autonomous teams

Their teams were like ministartups

They had product people and IT engineers in the same team
IT
so they could design build and test ideas with customers

independently of others in the company

They did not need handovers between departments

They had all the skills needed right there in the team

Now at the end of that day we had a session

to reflect on what we had learned

And we had started to like their model

so we were already thinking of how to apply some of these ideas to a bank

But then one of the hosts a guy who had not said a word all day

he suddenly said

So I see you like our model

But I have one question for you

What are you willing to give up

What were we willing to give up

We did not have an answer immediately but we knew he was right

Change is not only about embracing the new

it's about giving up on some of the old as well

Now over the past five years

I have worked with companies all over the world

to change their ways of working

And clearly every company has their own skeptics

about why this is not going to work for them

Our product is more complex

or They don't have the legacy IT like we do
IT
or Regulators just won't allow this in our industry

But for this bank and also for the other companies

that I have worked with afterwards

change was possible

Within a year we completely blew up the old silos

between marketing product channels and IT
IT
Three thousand employees were reorganized into  multidisciplinary teams

So instead of product people sitting just with product people

and engineers with engineers

a product person and an engineer were now members of the same team

You could be a member of a team responsible for account opening

or for the mobile banking app etc

At the golive date of that new organization

some people were shaking hands for the very first time

only to find out that they had been sitting two minutes away from each other

but they were sending each other emails and status reports for the last  years

You would hear someone saying

Ah so you're the guy that I was always chasing for answers

Laughter

But now they're having coffee together every day

If the product guy has an idea he can just raise it

to get input from the engineer who is sitting right next to him

They can decide to test with customers immediately 

no handovers no PowerPoints no red tape
PowerPoints
just getting stuff done

Now getting there is not easy

And as it turns out

What are you willing to give up

is exactly the right question to ask

Autonomous decisionmaking requires multidisciplinary teams

Instead of decisions going up and down the organization

we want the team to decide

But to do so we need all the skills and expertise for that decision

in the team

And this brings difficult tradeoffs

Can we physically colocate our people who are working in different buildings

different cities or even different countries today

Or should we invest in better videoconferencing

And how do we ensure consistency in the way we do things

across these teams

We still need some kind of management matrix

Now all these changes to structure and process and procedure 

they are not easy

But in the end

I found that the most difficult thing to change

is our own behavior

Let me try to illustrate

If we want these teams to be fast flexible creative like a ministartup

they have to be empowered and autonomous

But this means we cannot have leaders commanding their people what to do

when to do how to do

No micromanagers

But it also means that each employee needs to become a leader

regardless of their formal title

It's about all of us stepping up to take initiative

Now obviously we also cannot afford

to have all these teams running in different directions

because that would certainly lead to chaos

So we need alignment and autonomy at the same time

just like a flock of birds

In an organizational setting

this requires new behaviors

and with each new behavior

there is giving up on something old as well

Leaders have to make sure that everyone in the organization

is aligned around the overall purpose  the why 

and the overall priorities  the what

But then they have to let go and trust their teams

to make the right decisions on how to get there

Now creating alignment requires open and transparent communication

But you know how they say that information is a source of power

Well for some managers

sharing information may feel as if they're giving up that source of power

And it's not just managers

The teams need to communicate openly and transparently as well

In these companies the teams typically work in short sprints

and at the end of every sprint they organize a demo session

to share the output of what they've done transparently

And every day

each member of the team gives an update

of what they are working on individually

Now all this transparency can be uncomfortable for people

because suddenly there is no place to hide anymore

Everything we do is transparent for everyone

So alignment is not easy

and providing autonomy is not so obvious either

One executive at another company

likes to explain how he used to be a master of milestonetracking

Now today to know how things are going

instead of looking at status reports

he needs to walk down to the team floors to attend one of their sessions

And instead of telling people what to do

he looks for ways to help them

That is radical change

for someone who used to be a master of milestonetracking

But in the old world this executive said

I only had the illusion of control

In reality many projects would run over time and over budget anyway

Now I have much more transparency

and I can coursecorrect much earlier if needed

And middle managers need to change as well

First of all without the handovers and the PowerPoint
PowerPoint
there's less of a need for middle managers

And in the old world there was this idea of thinkers and doers

Employees would just follow orders

But now instead of only managing other people

middle managers were expected to become playercoaches

So imagine for the last  years

you have just been telling other people what to do

but now you're expected to do things yourself again

Clearly this model is not for everyone

and some great people leave the company

But the result is a new culture

with less hierarchy

And all of this is hard work

But it's worth it

The companies that I worked with

they were used to deploying new product features a few times per year

Now they have releases every few weeks

and without the handovers and the red tape

the whole organization becomes more efficient

And finally if you walk the halls of these companies today

you just feel a new energy

It feels as if you're walking the halls of a very large startup

Now to be fair these companies they cannot claim victory yet

But at least with this new model

they are much better prepared to respond to change

The world is getting faster and more complex

so we need to reboot our way of working

And the hardest part of that change is not in structure

or process or procedure

and it's also not just senior executives taking charge

Leaders will be all of those in the organization

who embrace the change

We all have to lead the change

So the question is

What are you willing to give up

Thank you

Beatboxing Yo what up

My name is Tom Thum

and I've got to say it's a pleasure to be back at TEDx
TED
When I first stepped upon the Sydney stage in 

as a starryeyed boy from Brisbane

I had no idea that I was about to deliver the most watched TEDx presentation ever
TEDx
Laughter

Applause

But you know I was stoked because it was completely unexpected

However standing before you today

as a slightly inflated timebattered version of myself five years later

I'm very confident

Laughter

Confident that I'm about deliver

the most instantly switched off and walkedouton

vomitinducing talk of all time

I'm about to show you things

that I think you'll find hard to unsee

but all in the name of science

First for those unfamiliar with what I do

I guess if you distilled it right down to its essence

you would call me a beatboxer

Beatboxing Yo for example 
Yo
here's a sample

Beatboxing

Rhythm changes

Hums a tune

Applause and cheers

Thank you

Applause

And being a beatboxer

it means that professionally

I am  percent reliant on the 

Beatboxing flexibility of the unfiltered human voice

And for years my contemporaries and I have been fielding questions like

Oh my God that's so cool

When did you figure out you could do that

After I practiced for thousands and thousands of hours 

Laughter

And what do you do for a real job

I'm a fulltime beatboxer Your Honor

But there is one question that I get quite a lot

that's a little bit more difficult to answer

and that is how are you doing it 

how are you making those noises

And I mean I know muscle memory dictates where I position my lips

in order to 

Beatboxing

but I have no idea about the inner mechanics of everything

You know all the flappy bits and kind of dangly things

and how they interact in 

Laughter

in a way that allows me to 

Beatboxing

To put it metaphorically

I know how to drive

I just don't know what's under the hood

So I decided to find out

and invite  captive strangers

a few uncomfortable cameras

everybody watching online and their browser history

into a place where not even the most intimate of encounters have been 

my throat

And to help me do that

I'd like to introduce to the stage a very specialist guest

from the Queensland Voice Center

a man that's been in my mouth more times than I'd care to admit

a legend of the larynx

ENT doctor and laryngeal surgeon

Whoo

It doesn't get that intimate

MB We set out a little while ago to try to go deep into the world 
MB
and the throat 

of this beatboxer extraordinaire

to try to understand how such a vast array of sounds are humanly possible

And what we found 

these are going in the mouth by the way 

and what we found was something absolutely amazing

Even after my two years of laryngeal surgery

in Harvard Medical School

with worldrenowned professor Steven Zeitels
Steven Zeitels
we never saw anything as extraordinary or fascinating as this

and that's what we're going to show you tonight

Alright so for those of you who might be a little squeamish

the next  minutes or so will get incrementally more graphic

so let's get into it 

TT Feel free to use the bucket

Laughter

MB So when we make sound

we use the vocal cords to take air from the lungs

and then turn it into a vibrating air column in the throat

If you think of it like a trumpet

we've got the mouthpiece  that's the vocal folds 

and then the horn section is the throat

If we took your head off

took a bit of your neck off

and left you as a torso with just your vocal folds vibrating

this is what you'd sound like

Flatulent sound

TT High pitch
TT
MB Pretty hard to communicate but fortunately we've got a throat
MB
We've got all the soft tissues

and that actually gives you all the incredible dynamics of sound

that you'll hear tonight

Now this is a rigid laryngoscope

TT Hmm spicy boy

Laughter

MB I know I know
MB
Laughter

 millimeters in diameter

it gives us the highest resolution image of the larynx we can get

And we teed up with a stroboscope here

and a trigger microphone

The mic will pick up the frequency

and that will allow us to show you how this all works

So if we can have the lights down

TT Low pitch
TT
MB Turn the light on here
MB
TT High and low pitches
TT
MB So I've got the frequency of sound matched with the stroboscope

That's the light you're seeing flickering in the cup

TT Low pitch
TT
MB And that's at about  hertz or so
MB
So what we can do then is we can take that

and put the phase of the strobe and the sound just out of sync

That lets us capture realtime slowmotion activity of vibrating tissues

When we apply that to the larynx

we get this fluid slowmotion of the vibrating vocal folds

So that's what we're going to get on and do

Alright you ready

TT Yup
TT
Laughter

MB OK so here we go
MB
We're going to have a look at the voice box

Laughter

It's very hard not to gag with this

Say e
e
TT Singing E 
TTE
MB So down the bottom you see the vocal cords

the little cordlike structures

Laughter

And now just look at the skin on the neck

and you'll see how strong the light is to penetrate the skin

Alright so if you'll have the lights back on

Laughter

Applause

Alright so just give us a comfortable e

TT Singing E

Laughter

TT Singing E
TTE
Audience gasps

MB So that's the vibrating vocal folds
MB
about  hertz

Means they've collided  times a second

just to make that sound

And we can also see that they're absolutely perfectly normal

So all his beatboxing all those sounds for years

with Tom's way of doing it 

absolutely no damage whatsoever

That's really remarkable

Well done

OK

TT High pitch
TT
We've got this

MB So watch now as the vocal cords go from high pitch to low pitch

You'll see them go from long and skinny to short and fat

Really think e
e
TT High to low pitch E
TTE
MB Right
MB
TT High to low pitch E
TTE
MB And what you can see is that his vocal range is so extreme 
MB
much more extreme than any other performer I've worked with 

the machine actually can't capture the really high pitches

TT High pitch
TT
MB So we know that whistle register is somewhere around  hertz
MB
That means the vocal cords

well over  times a second

are banging together just to make that sound

That's really extraordinary

If you think about them they're only  millimeters long

so that's barely the width of your thumb

That's incred 

Laughter

That's amazing this organ can do such a thing

So now we're going to swap over to the flexible laryngoscope

This is a little more graphic

TT He bought it at SEXPO
TTSEXPO
Laughter

MB That wasn't in the script

Laughter

Applause

TT Secondhand
TT
Laughter

MB Now we've had to time this bit perfectly
MB
because of the requirement for local anesthetic

You've got to numb the nose get the camera in

It doesn't help for producing a lot of the sounds

but it gives us a really cool view of what's happening

So hold onto the stomachs and let's see what we can do

Audience gasps

So we're going to the back of the nose

And there you can see the soft palate

A lot of the sounds we make from day to day

even the simple ones

are incredibly complex

The sound kh for example
kh
It's the soft palate sealing up precisely against the back of the nose

So if you say it loudly five times

feel your own soft palate snapping against the back of the throat

Kh kh kh kh kh kh
Khkhkhkhkhkh
Alright so this is what it looks like when Tom does it

TT Kh kh kh kh kh

of course they can use that for all sorts of different effects

I can help you

TT This is fine we're professionals

Laughter

Beatboxing

MB Alright
MB
Applause and cheers

Now we're going to slide down a little further

If you'll just have the lights off

and just see if you can see the light in the mouth somewhere

You'll be able to see exactly where the camera is at

Laughter

TT Singing
TT
Surprise

Laughter

MB Alright
MB
Audience gasps

So what you can see there that's the base of the tongue

The side walls of the screen

that's the pharynx

All muscle walls

and in the deep dark decks is the larynx

TT Oh should we have the lights back on

I think it's a good idea

It's getting a bit creepy with them off

MB Turn the lights on thanks
MB
Good

Now having examined over  larynxes and throats in my time

I can tell you that Tom's is as anatomically normal

as anyone else's

It's just his unique use of all the muscles and soft tissues

which lets him do all these amazing sounds that you're going to hear

So we will dissect some of these sounds for you now

TT It's in there really Definitely
TT
Laughter

OK

Highpitched sounds

Highpitched sounds

Hooting

MB So what he's doing is he's changing the shape

and the length of the vibrating air column

using rhythmic contractions of all the muscles

to generate all those sounds that you're hearing

Beatboxing

Laughter

Low pitch

MB And now there's rhythmic movements of the 
MB
they're the arytenoid cartilages way down there

rocking back and forth to create that different sound

TT Low pitch
TT
MB And we like to call this sphincter bass
MB
Laughter

And what you can see is that collapsing all the tissue down 

Laughter

allows a different kind of really deep bass note

Alright so with local anesthetic on board

a big black hose in the nose

we're going to let loose a sliver of his repertoire

and see all this in play

And we'll move 

careful

TT Can you pull it up just a smidgeon
TT
Laughter

TT Beatboxing
TT
Maybe just a little more

Alright cool I think we're good

TT Thank you so much

Bryn Freedman You're a guy whose company funds these AI programs and invests

So why should we trust you to not have a bias

and tell us something really useful for the rest of us

about the future of work

Roy Bahat Yes I am

And when you wake up in the morning and you read the newspaper

and it says The robots are coming they may take all our jobs

as a startup investor focused on the future of work

our fund was the first one to say

artificial intelligence should be a focus for us

So I woke up one morning and read that and said

Oh my gosh they're talking about me That's me who's doing that

And then I thought wait a minute

If things continue

then maybe not only will the startups in which we invest struggle

because there won't be people to have jobs

to pay for the things that they make and buy them

but our economy and society might struggle too

And look I should be the guy who sits here and tells you

Everything is going to be fine It's all going to work out great

Hey when they introduced the ATM machine

years later there's more tellers in banks

It's true

And yet when I looked at it I thought This is going to accelerate

And if it does accelerate there's a chance the center doesn't hold

But I figured somebody must know the answer to this

there are so many ideas out there

And I read all the books and I went to the conferences

and at one point we counted more than  efforts to study the future of work

And it was a frustrating experience

because I'd hear the same backandforth over and over again

The robots are coming

And then somebody else would say

Oh don't worry about that they've always said that and it turns out OK

Then somebody else would say

Well it's really about the meaning of your job anyway

And then everybody would shrug and go off and have a drink

And it felt like there was this Kabuki theater of this discussion

where nobody was talking to each other

And many of the people that I knew and worked with in the technology world

were not speaking to policy makers

the policy makers were not speaking to them

And so we partnered with a nonpartisan think tank NGO called New America

to study this issue

And we brought together a group of people

including an AI czar at a technology company
AI
and a video game designer

and a heartland conservative

and a Wall Street investor

and a socialist magazine editor 

literally all in the same room it was occasionally awkward 
 
to try to figure out what is it that will happen here

The question we asked was simple

It was What is the effect of technology on work going to be

And we looked out  to  years

because we wanted to look out far enough that there could be real change

but soon enough that we weren't talking about teleportation or anything like that

And we recognized 

and I think every year we're reminded of this in the world 

that predicting what's going to happen is hard

So instead of predicting there are other things you can do

You can try to imagine alternate possible futures

which is what we did
We did a scenarioplanning exercise
and we imagined cases where no job is safe

We imagined cases where every job is safe

And we imagined every distinct possibility we could

And the result which really surprised us

was when you think through those futures and you think what should we do

the answers about what we should do actually turn out to be the same

no matter what happens

And the irony of looking out  to  years into the future is

you realize that the things we want to act on

are actually already happening right now

The automation is right now the future is right now

BF So what does that mean and what does that tell us
BF
If the future is now what is it that we should be doing

and what should we be thinking about

RB We have to understand the problem first
RB
And so the data are that as the economy becomes more productive

and individual workers become more productive

their wages haven't risen

If you look at the proportion of prime workingage men

in the United States at least

who work now versus in 

we have three times as many men not working

And then you hear the stories

I sat down with a group of Walmart workers and said

What do you think about this cashier this futuristic selfcheckout thing

They said That's nice but have you heard about the cash recycler

That's a machine that's being installed right now

and is eliminating two jobs at every Walmart right now

And so we just thought Geez We don't understand the problem

And so we looked at the voices that were the ones that were excluded

which is all of the people affected by this change

And we decided to listen to them

sort of automation and its discontents

And I've spent the last couple of years doing that

I've been to Flint Michigan and Youngstown Ohio

talking about entrepreneurs trying to make it work

in a very different environment from New York or San Francisco

or London or Tokyo

I've been to prisons twice

to talk to inmates about their jobs after they leave

I've sat down with truck drivers to ask them about the selfdriving truck

with people who in addition to their fulltime job

care for an aging relative

And when you talk to people

there were two themes that came out loud and clear

The first one was that people are less looking for more money

or get out of the fear of the robot taking their job

and they just want something stable

They want something predictable

So if you survey people and ask them what they want out of work

for everybody who makes less than  dollars a year

they'll take a more stable and secure income on average

over earning more money

And if you think about the fact that

not only for all of the people across the earth who don't earn a living

but for those who do

the vast majority earn a different amount from month to month

and have an instability

all of a sudden you realize

Wait a minute We have a real problem on our hands

And the second thing they say which took us a longer time to understand

is they say they want dignity

And that concept of selfworth through work

emerged again and again and again in our conversations

BF So I certainly appreciate this answer
BF
But you can't eat dignity

you can't clothe your children with selfesteem

So what is that how do you reconcile 

what does dignity mean

and what is the relationship between dignity and stability

RB You can't eat dignity You need stability first

And the good news is

many of the conversations that are happening right now

are about how we solve that

You know I'm a proponent of studying guaranteed income

as one example

conversations about how health care gets provided

and other benefits

Those conversations are happening

and we're at a time where we must figure that out

It is the crisis of our era

And my point of view after talking to people

is that we may do that

and it still might not be enough

Because what we need to do from the beginning is understand

what is it about work that gives people dignity

so they can live the lives that they want to live

And so that concept of dignity is 

it's difficult to get your hands around

because when many people hear it  especially to be honest rich people 

they hear meaning

They hear My work is important to me

And again if you survey people and you ask them

How important is it to you that your work be important to you

only people who make  dollars a year or more

say that it is important to them that their work be important

BF Meaning meaningful
BF
RB Just defined as Is your work important to you
RB
Whatever somebody took that to mean

And yet of course dignity is essential

We talked to truck drivers who said

I saw my cousin drive and I got on the open road and it was amazing

And I started making more money than people who went to college

Then they'd get to the end of their thought and say something like

People need their fruits and vegetables in the morning

and I'm the guy who gets it to them

We talked to somebody who in addition to his job was caring for his aunt

He was making plenty of money

At one point we just asked

What is it about caring for your aunt Can't you just pay somebody to do it
 
He said My aunt doesn't want somebody we pay for

My aunt wants me

So there was this concept there of being needed

If you study the word dignity it's fascinating

It's one of the oldest words in the English language from antiquity

And it has two meanings

one is selfworth

and the other is that something is suitable it's fitting

meaning that you're part of something greater than yourself

and it connects to some broader whole

In other words that you're needed

BF So how do you answer this question
BF
this concept that we don't pay teachers

and we don't pay eldercare workers

and we don't pay people who really care for people

and are needed enough

RB Well the good news is people are finally asking the question

So as AI investors we often get phone calls

from foundations or CEOs and boardrooms saying

What do we do about this

And they used to be asking

What do we do about introducing automation

And now they're asking What do we do about selfworth

And they know that the employees who work for them

who have a spouse who cares for somebody

that dignity is essential to their ability to just do their job

I think there's two kinds of answers

there's the money side of just making your life work

That's stability You need to eat

And then you think about our culture more broadly

and you ask Who do we make into heroes

And you know what I want is to see the magazine cover

that is the person who is the heroic caregiver

Or the Netflix series that dramatizes the person
Netflix
who makes all of our other lives work so we can do the things we do

Let's make heroes out of those people

That's the Netflix show that I would binge
Netflix
And we've had chroniclers of this before 

Studs Terkel

the oral history of the working experience in the United States

And what we need is the experience of needing one another

and being connected to each other

Maybe that's the answer for how we all fit as a society

And the thought exercise to me is

if you were to go back  years and have people 

my grandparents greatgrandparents a tailor worked in a mine 

they look at what all of us do for a living and say That's not work

We sit there and type and talk and there's no danger of getting hurt

And my guess is that if you were to imagine  years from now

we'll still be doing things for each other

We'll still need one another

And we just will think of it as work

The entire thing I'm trying to say

is that dignity should not just be about having a job

Because if you say you need a job to have dignity

which many people say

the second you say that you say to all the parents

and all the teachers and all the caregivers

that all of a sudden

because they're not being paid for what they're doing

it somehow lacks this essential human quality

To me that's the great puzzle of our time

Can we figure out how to provide that stability throughout life

and then can we figure out how to create an inclusive

not just racially gender but multigenerationally inclusive 

I mean every different human experience included 

in this way of understanding how we can be needed by one another

BF Thank you RB Thank you

Let's start with silence

Silence is one of the most precious conditions for humans

because it allows us to feel the depth of our presence

This is one of the reasons why the advent of electric cars

has generated lots of enthusiasm among people

For the first time we could associate the concept of cars

with the experience of silence

Cars can finally be quiet

peace in the streets

a silent revolution in the cities

Hum

But silence can also be a problem

The absence of sound in fact when it comes to cars

it can be quite dangerous

Think of blind people

who can't see a car which is approaching

And now if it's electric they can't even hear it

Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city

we are absorbed in our thoughts and we detach from the surroundings

In these situations sound can become our precious companion

Sound is one of the most wonderful gifts of our universe

Sound is emotion

and sound is sublime

and when it comes to cars sound is also information

In order to protect pedestrians

and to give acoustic feedback to the drivers

governments around the world have introduced several regulations

which prescribe the presence of a sound for electric vehicles

In particular they require minimum sound levels

at specific frequency bands

up to the speed of  kilometers per hour

Besides this speed

the natural noise of the car is considered as sufficient

These regulations have generated different reactions

among those who favor sounds and those who fear the presence

of too much noise in the city

However I don't see it as the noise of the car

I rather see it as the voice of the car

And this is one of my biggest challenges and privileges at the same time

I design the voice of electric cars

We all know how a combustion engine sounds like

and we do actually also know how an electric engine sounds like

Think of the electric tramway

As soon as it moves

it creates this ascending highfrequency pitch sound

which we called whistling sound

However if we would just amplify this sound

we would still not be able to fulfill the legal requirements

That's also why we need to compose new sound

So how do we go after it

In many cities the traffic is already very chaotic

and we don't need more chaos

But the streets of the st century are a great case study

teeming with transience cross purposes and disarray

And this landscape offers a great opportunity

for developing new solutions on how to reduce this chaos

I have conceived a new approach that tries to reduce the chaos

by introducing harmony

Since many people don't know how an electric car could sound like

I have to define first of all a new sound world

something that doesn't belong to our previous experience

but creates a reference for the future

Together with a small team we create lots of sonic textures

that are able to transmit emotion

Just like a painter with colors

we are able to connect feelings and frequencies

so that whenever one is approaching a car

we can feel an emotion

which besides fulfilling the legal requirements

speaks also about the character and the identity of the car

I call this paradigm sound genetics

With sound genetics I define first of all an aesthetic space of sound

and at the same time I search for new innovative methods

for generating soundscapes that we don't know

soundscapes that allow us to envision abstract worlds

to make them tangible and audible

Sound genetics is based on three steps

The first one is the definition of a sonic organism

the second one is a description of sonic variations

and the third one is the composition of sound genes

The description of a sonic organism is based on a cluster of properties

that every sound that I compose should have

[Sound is moving]
[]
I transfer to a small sound entity such as the sound of a car

the power of the motion of music

so that sound can move so

[Sound is acting]
[]
And just like a dancer on a stage

sound will project trajectories of sound in the air

[Sound is memory]
[]
And it's not just about the sound of a car

It's the memory of my father coming back home

[Sound is hypnotizing]
[]
And sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder

which hypnotizes

And ultimately

[Sound is superhuman]
[]
sound goes beyond the human condition

because it allows us to transcend

As a second step we define the sonic variations

[Identity prism]
[]
Just like humans where different bodies generate different voices

also different car shapes have a different acoustic behavior

which depends on the geometry and the materials

So we have to know first of all how this car propagates the sound outside

by means of acoustic measurements

And just like a single voice is able to produce different tones and timbres

at the same time we produce different sonic variations

within a space of eight words that I defined

And some of them are to me really important

such as the concept of visionary

of elegance of dynamic of embracing

And once we have defined these two aspects

we have what I call the identity prism

which is something like the sonic identity card of a car

And as a third step we enter the world of the sound design

where the sound genes are composed

and a new archetype is conceived

Now let me show you another example

of how I transform a sound field into a melody

Think that I am a violin player on stage

If I would start to play the violin

I would generate a sound field which would propagate in this hall

and at some point the sound field would hit the side walls

and would be scattered all over the place

And this is how it looked like

Some time ago I captured several ways of sound to hit side walls

And last year I was asked by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra

to compose ringtones that they were going to play

So one of them I had the idea to start from this sound field

I took a section

I superimposed the section over the distribution

of the musicians onstage

and then I followed the blooming of the sound field

by means of three parameters

time intensity and frequency

Then I wrote down all the gradients for each instrument

and as you can see for instance

the piece will start with the string section playing very softly

and then it's going to have a crescendo as the brasses the woods will jump in

and the melody will end with a harp and a piano

playing on the highest range

Let's listen how it sounded like

Ethereal music

Music ends

So this is the sound of my alarm clock actually in the morning

Laughter

And now let's go back to electric cars

And let's listen to the first example that I showed you

Hum

And now I would like to show you how a potential sound

based on the sound genetics for electric cars could sound like

Ethereal music

Pitch rises with acceleration

Cars are a metaphor of time distance and journey

of setting out and returning

of anticipation and adventure

but at the same time of intelligence and complexity

of human intuition and accomplishment

And the sound has to glorify all that

I see cars both as living creatures

and as highly complex performative art installations

The sounds that we envision through sound genetics

allow us not only to celebrate this complexity

but also to make the world a more elegant and safe space

Thank you

I really love color

I notice it everywhere and in everything

My family makes fun of me

because I like to use colors with elusivesounding names

like celadon 

Laughter

ecru

Now if you haven't noticed I am black thank you 

Laughter

and when you grow up in a segregated city as I have

like Chicago

you're conditioned to believe that color and race can never be separate

There's hardly a day that goes by

that somebody is not reminding you of your color

Racism is my city's vivid hue

Now we can all agree that race is a socially constructed phenomenon

but it's often hard to see it in our everyday existence

Its pervasiveness is everywhere

The neighborhoods I grew up in

were filled with a kind of culturally coded beauty

Major commercial corridors were lined with brightly painted storefronts

that competed for black consumer dollars

The visual mashups of corner stores and beauty supply houses

currency exchanges

are where I actually inadvertently learned the foundational principles

of something I would later come to know is called color theory

I can remember being pretty intimidated by this term in college 

color theory

All these stuffy old white guys with their treatises

and obscure terminologies

I'd mastered each one of their color palettes and associated principles

Color theory essentially boils down to the art and science

of using color to form compositions and spaces

It's not so complicated

This was my bible in college

Josef Albers posited a theory about the color red

and it always has stuck with me

He argues that the iconic color of a cola can is red

and that in fact all of us can agree that it's red

but the kinds of reds that we imagine

are as varied as the number of people in this room

So imagine that

This color that we've all been taught since kindergarten is primary 

red yellow blue 

in fact is not primary

is not irreducible

is not objective but quite subjective

What

Laughter

Albers called this relational

Relational

And so it was the first time

that I was able to see my own neighborhood as a relational context

Each color is affected by its neighbor

Each other is affected by its neighbor

In the s

the United States government created

the Federal Housing Administration

which in turn created a series of maps

which were using a colorcoding system to determine which neighborhoods

should and should not receive federal housing loans

Their residential security map was its own kind of color palette

and in fact was more influential than all of those color palettes

that I had been studying in college combined

Banks would not lend to people who lived in neighborhoods like mine

That's me in D
D
Their cartographers were literally coloring in these maps

and labeling that color hazardous

Red was the new black

and black neighborhoods were colored

The problem persists today

and we've seen it most recently in the foreclosure crisis

In Chicago this is best symbolized by these Xs
X
that are emblazoned on the fronts of vacated houses

on the South and West Side

The reality is that someone else's color palettes were determining

my physical and artistic existence

Ridiculous

I decided that I'd create my own color palette

and speak to the people who live where I do

and alter the way that color had been defined for us

It was a palette that I didn't have to search far for

and look for in a treatise

because I already knew it

What kind of painter emerges from this reality

What color is urban

What color is ghetto

What color is privilege

What color is gangrelated

What color is gentrification

What color is Freddie Gray

What color is Mike Brown

Finally I'd found a way

to connect my racialized understanding of color

with my theoretical understanding of color

And I gave birth to my third baby

Colored Theory
ed
Laughter

Colored Theory was a twoyear artistic project
ed
in which I applied my own color palette to my own neighborhoods

in my own way

Now if I walked down th Street right now

and I asked  people for the name of the slightly greener shade of cyan

they would look at me sideways

Laughter

But if I say What color is Ultra Sheen 
Ultra Sheen 
oh a smile emerges

stories about their grandmother's bathroom ensue

I mean who needs turquoise when you have Ultra Sheen

Who needs teal when you have Ultra Sheen
Ultra Sheen
Who needs ultramarine when you have 

Audience Ultra Sheen
Ultra Sheen
Laughter

This is exactly how I derived my palette

I would ask friends and family

and people with backgrounds that were similar to mine

for those stories and memories

The stories weren't always happy

but the colors always resonated more than the product itself

I took those theories to the street

and Crown Royal Bag

I painted soontobedemolished homes

in a muchmaligned area called Englewood

We'd gather up as much paint as I could fit in my trunk

I'd call my most trusted art homies

my amazing husband always by my side

and we'd paint every inch of the exteriors in monochromatic fashion

I wanted to understand scale in a way that I hadn't before

I wanted to apply the colors to the biggest canvas I could imagine 

houses

So I'd obsessively drive up and down familiar streets that I'd grown up on

I'd crossreference these houses with the city's data portal

to make sure that they'd been tagged for demolition 

unsalvageable left for dead

I really wanted to understand what it meant to just let color rule

to trust my instincts

to stop asking for permission

No meetings with city officials

no community buyin

just let color rule

in my desire to paint different pictures about the South Side

These houses sit in stark contrast to their fully lined counterparts

We'd paint to make them stand out like Monopoly pieces

in these environments

And we'd go on these early Sunday mornings

and keep going until we ran out of that paint or until someone complained

Hey did you paint that

a driver asked as I was taking this image one day

Me nervously

Yes

His face changed

Aw I thought Prince was coming

Laughter

He had grown up on this block

and so you could imagine when he drove past

and saw one of its last remaining houses mysteriously change colors overnight

it was clearly not a Crown Royal bag involved

it was a secret beacon from Prince

Laughter

And though that block was almost all but erased

it was the idea that Prince could pop up in unexpected places

and give free concerts in areas that the music industry and society

had deemed were not valuable anymore

For him

the idea that just the image of this house

was enough to bring Prince there

meant that it was possible

In that moment

that little patch of Eggleston had become synonymous with royalty

And for however briefly

Eric Bennett's neighborhood had regained its value
Eric Bennett
So we traded stories despite being strangers

about which high school we'd gone to

and where we'd grown up

and Mrs Soandso's candy store 

of being kids on the South Side

And once I revealed

that in fact this project had absolutely nothing to do with Prince

Eric nodded in seeming agreement

and as we parted ways and he drove off

he said But he could still come

Laughter

He had assumed full ownership of this project

and was not willing to relinquish it

even to me its author

That for me was success

I wish I could tell you that this project transformed the neighborhood

and all the indices that we like to rely on

increased jobs reduced crime no alcoholism 

but in fact it's more gray than that

Colored Theory catalyzed new conversations
ed
about the value of blackness

Colored Theory made unmistakably visible the uncomfortable questions
ed
that institutions and governments have to ask themselves

about why they do what they do

They ask equally difficult questions of myself and my neighborhood counterparts

about our value systems

and what our path to collective agency needs to be

Color gave me freedom in a way that didn't wait for permission

or affirmation or inclusion

Color was something that I could rule now

One of the neighborhood members and paint crew members said it best

when he said This didn't change the neighborhood

it changed people's perceptions about what's possible for their neighborhood

in big and small ways

Passersby would ask me Why are you painting that house

when you know the city's just going to come and tear it down

At the time I had no idea

I just knew that I had to do something

I would give anything to better understand color as both a medium

and as an inescapable way that I am identified in society

If I have any hope of making the world better

I have to love and leverage both of these ways that I'm understood

and therein lies the value and the hue

Thank you

Applause and cheers

The basic problem with working in an office

is you're just not in control of your work environment

Our focus on distributed work didn't happen accidentally

It was a conscious choice from the very beginning

Notice I don't use the word remote

because it sets up the expectation

that some people are essential and some aren't

I use the word distributed to describe what we do

where everyone is on an equal playing field

I think a distributed workforce

is the most effective way to build a company

The key is you have to approach it consciously

When we started WordPress
WordPress
many of the first  hires were people I'd never met in person

But we'd collaborated online sometimes for years

I wanted to continue that for one simple reason

I believe that talent and intelligence

are equally distributed throughout the world

But opportunity is not

In Silicon Valley the big tech companies fish

from essentially the same small pond or bay

A distributed company can fish from the entire ocean

Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives in California

you can gain someone who lives works

wakes up and goes to sleep wherever they are in the world

They bring a different understanding of that culture

and a different lived experience

At the base of the decision to go distributed

there's a desire to give people autonomy over how they do their work

Unless you're in a role where specific hours are important

you can make your own schedule

Everyone can have a corner office their windows the food they want to eat

you can choose when there's music and when there's silence

You can choose what temperature the room should be

You can save the time you'd spend commuting

and put it into things that are important to you

A distributed workforce is ideal for a technology company

But people often ask me

This works great for y'all but what about everyone else

If you have an office

you can do a few things to build distributed capability

First document everything

In an office it's easy to make decisions in the moment

in the kitchen in the hall

But if people work remotely

and some members of the team are having those conversations

they don't have access to

they'll see these decisions being made without understanding the why

Always leave a trail of where you were and what you were thinking about

This allows others to pick up where you left off

It allows people in different time zones to interact

it's also great to think about as an organization evolves

people leaving and people joining

Try to have as much communication as possible online

When everything's shared and public it allows new people to catch up quickly

You also need to find the right tools

There are so many apps and services that help with daytoday communication

video conferencing project management

The things that changed how you work probably aren't objects anymore

They're things you access through your computer

So experiment with different tools that enable collaboration

see what works

Create productive facetoface time

In a traditional office

you're in the same place  weeks out of the year

and you might have three or four weeks apart

We try to flip that we come together for short intense bursts

Once a year we do a grand meetup

where the entire company comes together for a week

It's halfwork halfplay

The primary goal is connecting people

We want to make sure everyone's aligned and on the same page

and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues

When they work together the rest of the year

they can bring together that understanding and empathy

And the final practice

give people the flexibility to make their own work environment

Every person at Automattic has a coworking stipend

that they can put towards a coworking space

or just to buy coffee so they don't get kicked out of the coffee shop

One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together

and rented a workspace on a fishing pier

Each person who joins the company gets a homeoffice stipend

This is money they can invest in getting the right chair monitor

the right desk setup so they can have the most productive environment for them

Today there are just a few companies that are distributed first

In a decade or two I predict that  percent of companies

that are going to be changing the course of the world

are going to function this way

They will evolve to be distributed first or they'll be replaced by those that are

As you think about what you're going to build next

consider how you can tap into global talent

give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should

and still participate fully in whatever it is that you're creating together

A leader is steady firm decisive unwavering

Never let 'em see you sweat always have an answer

[The Way We Work]

My name is Dan I'm a partner at a global creative consultancy

But there's another side to me

Carrie Dragshaw

the character I created on Instagram
Instagram
As I thought about my double life I couldn't help but wonder 

When your true self is a little nontraditional

how much of it can you really bring to the office

For some of us is authenticity offlimits

For the first  years of my career

I thought there was one way to be a leader

decisive and serious

But that's not me

So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role

I'd talk in a deeper voice try to hold in my hand motions

I'm someone who gets really excited about things

so I'd temper that

I had this little voice in my head telling me

You're too gay too feminine too flamboyant

I had one wellintentioned adviser who said

Everyone knows you're gay And that's great

But you don't need to beat them over the head with it

Cut to me in a tutu for Halloween 

I dressed up as my favorite TV show character Carrie Bradshaw

thinking my friends would get a kick out of it

And then things got crazy

The post went viral and at first it was pure fun

I started getting these incredible messages from people

about how happy it made them

how it encouraged them to be their authentic selves

And I started to think

maybe this is the time to tell that little voice in my head to just shut up

and let myself be me

But then things got a little too big

Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere  In the New York Post US Weekly 
New York PostAmerican Weekly
and I got terrified

What would my bosses think

Would my coworkers still respect me as a leader

What would my clients think

I thought I was going to have to get a different job

But then something happened something small

I got a text from my boss it wasn't long it just said

Wow Cosmo

With a link to an article that had just gone up about me

And it let me put that little scared voice away

and just be excited about this whole new world

rather than freaked out

That's the power of one person

sometimes all it takes is one ally to make you feel comfortable

And my coworkers started acting differently

They became more open more playful with me

it was as if knowing this other side of me

gave them permission to be more of themselves as well

I thought that openness and vulnerability

would actually decrease my standing with my team

But it's done the opposite

Two years in

I never could have imagined that this part of me would not just be embraced

but could actually help my career

Now I'm lucky

I work in New York City

in an office where creativity is valued

and I was already pretty established in my career when all of this started

Maybe that's you maybe it isn't

But all of this has taught me so much

about just the importance of bringing your whole self to work

And it's really challenged my own misperceptions

about what it takes to be successful

There's no one kind of way to be a leader

It's about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them

Before if a meeting was hard I'd put on my perfect leader mask

Now I can say Gosh that was frustrating

We can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way

rather than everybody pretending that they're fine until it's too late

Concealing an identity takes work

Think of all the wasted energy spent pretending

wishing you were someone different

What's most interesting to me though is that in this big study of covering

 percent of those who say they're doing it

also believe their organization values inclusion

So clearly our workplaces and all of our strange inner voices

have a long way to go on acceptance

There's a big difference between adapting and disguising

And I think I learned that a little late

Personally I'm taking all of this as a call to be the ally

who like my boss did for me

lets people know that it's OK to open up

If you're gay or proud of your ethnic background

or have a disability or are deeply religious

see what it's like being your full self at work

You might be pleasantly surprised

So imagine a company hires a new employee

best in the business

who's on a multimilliondollar contract

Now imagine that whenever this employee went to go meet with her team members

the appointments were ignored or dismissed

and in the meetings that did happen

she was yelled at or kicked out after a few minutes

So after a while she just went quietly back to her desk

sat there with none of her skills being put to use

of course being ignored by most people

and of course still getting paid millions of dollars

This hotshot employee who can't seem to catch a break

is that company's technology

This scenario is not an exaggeration

In my job as a technology advisor

I've seen so many companies make the wellmeaning decisions

to put huge investments into technology

only to have the benefits fail to live up to the expectation

In fact in one study I read

 percent of technology projects

are canceled or deliver things that are never used

That's like billions of dollars just being wasted each year

So why is this

Well from what I've seen

the expectation from the top management is high but not unreasonable

about the benefits from the technology

They expect people will use them

it will create time savings

and people will become genuinely better at their jobs

But the reality is that the people on the front line

who are supposed to be using these softwares and tools

they're skeptical or even afraid

We postpone the online trainings

we don't bother to learn the shortcuts

and we get frustrated at the number of tools

we have to remember how to log into and use

Right

And that frustration that guilt  it's racking up

the more that technology is inserting itself into our daily working lives

which is a lot

Brookings says that  percent of jobs today in the US

require at least midlevel digital skills

So basically to work these days

you need to be able to work with technology

But from what I've seen

we are not approaching this with the right mindset

So here's the idea that I've been toying with

What if we treated technology like a team member

I've been writing my own personal experiment about this

I've spoken to people from all different industries

about how they can treat their core technologies like colleagues

I've met with people from the restaurant industry

medical professionals teachers bankers

people from many other sectors

and the first step with anybody that I would meet with

was to draw out the structure of their teams

in an organization chart

Now I'm a total geek when it comes to organization charts

Org charts are really cool because if they are drawn well

you can quickly get a sense of what individual roles are

and also how a team works well together

But if you look at a typical org chart

it only includes the boxes and lines that represent people

None of the technology team members are there

They're all invisible

So for each of the organizations that I met with for my experiment

I had to draw a new type of org chart

one that also included the technology

And when I did this people I spoke to

could actually visualize their technologies as coworkers

and they could ask things like

Is this software reporting to the right person

Does this man and machine team work well together

Is that technology actually the team member

that everybody's awkwardly avoiding

So I will walk you through an example of a small catering company

to bring this experiment to life

This is the top layer of people who work at Bovingdons Catering Company
Bovingdons
There's a sales director who manages all of the customer interactions

and there's an operations director who manages all the internal activities

And here's the people who report to the sales and operations directors

And finally here's the view

where we've overlaid the software and the hardware

that's used by the Bovingdons staff

Using this amazing org chart we can now explore

how the human team members and the technology team members

are interacting

So the first thing that I'm going to look for

is where there's a human and machine relationship

that's extra critical

Usually it's somebody using a technology

on a daytoday basis to do his or her job

At Bovingdons

the finance director with the accounting platform would be one

Next I would check on the status of their collaboration

Are they working well together

Getting along

In this case it turned out to be a tenuous relationship

So what to do

Well if the accounting platform were actually a person

the finance director would feel responsible for managing it

and taking care of it

Well in the same way

my first suggestion was to think about a teambuilding activity

maybe getting together on a specialist course

My second suggestion was to think about scheduling regular performance reviews

for the accounting platform

where the finance director would literally give feedback

to the company who sold it

Now there will be several of these really important human and machine teams

in every organization

So if you're in one it's worth taking the time

to think about ways to make those relationships truly collaborative

Next I'll look on the chart for any human role

which might be overloaded by technology

let's say interacting with four or more types of applications

At Bovingdons the operations director was interacting with five technologies
Bovingdon
Now he told me that he'd always felt overwhelmed by his job

but it wasn't until our conversation

that he thought it might be because of the technologies he was overseeing

And we were talking that

if the operations director had actually had a lot of people reporting to him

he probably would have done something about it

because it was stretching him too thin

like move some of them to report to somebody else

So in the same way we talked about moving some of the technologies

to report to someone else

like the food inventory to go to the chef

The last thing that I'll look for is any technology

that seems to be on the org chart without a real home

Sometimes they're floating around without an owner

Sometimes they're reporting to so many different areas

that you can't tell who's actually using it

Now at Bovingdons
Bovingdon
nobody appeared to be looking after the marketing software

It was like someone had hired it and then didn't give it a desk

or any instructions on what to do

So clearly it needed a job description

maybe someone to manage it

But in other companies

you might find that a technology has been sidelined for a reason

like it's time for it to leave or be retired

Now retiring applications is something that all companies do

But maybe taking the mindset that those applications are actually coworkers

could help them to decide when and how to retire those applications

in the way that would be least destructive to the rest of the team

I did this experiment with  different professionals

and each time it sparked an idea

Sometimes a bit more

You remember that hotshot employee I was telling you about

that everybody was ignoring

That was a real story told to me by Christopher

a very energetic human resources manager at a big consumer goods company

Technology was a new HR platform

and it had been installed for  months at great expense

but nobody was using it

So we were talking about how

if this had really been such a hotshot employee with amazing credentials

you would go out of your way to get to know it

maybe invite them for coffee

get to know their background

So in the spirit of experimentation

Christopher set up onehour appointments

coffee optional

for his team members to have no agenda but to get to know their HR system

Some people they clicked around menu item by menu item

Other people they searched online for things that they weren't clear about

A couple of them got together gossiped about the new software in town

And a few weeks later Christopher called to tell me

that people were using the system in new ways

and he thought it was going to save them weeks of effort in the future

And they also reported feeling less intimidated by the software

I found that pretty amazing

that taking this mindset helped Christopher's team

and others that I spoke to these past few months

actually feel happier about working with technology

And I later found out this is backed up by research

Studies have shown that people who work in organizations

that encourage them to talk about and learn about the technologies

in the workplace

have  percent lower stress levels

than those in organizations that don't

I also found it really cool that when I started to do this experiment

I started with what was happening between a person

and an individual technology

but then it ultimately led to ideas about how to manage tech

across entire companies

Like when I did this for my own job and extended it

I thought about how our data analysis tools

should go on the equivalent of a job rotation program

where different parts of the company could get to know it

And I also thought about suggesting to our recruiting team

that some of the technologies we work with every day

should come with us on our big recruiting events

If you were a university student

how cool would it be to not only get to know the people

you might be working with

but also the technologies

Now all of this begs the question

What have we been missing

by keeping the technologies that we work with day to day invisible

and what beyond those billions of dollars in value

might we be leaving on the table

The good news is

you don't need to be an org chart geek like me

to take this experiment forward

It will take a matter of minutes for most people

to draw out a structure of who they work with

a little bit longer to add in the technologies

to get a view of the entire team

and then you can have fun asking questions like

Which are the technologies that I'll be taking out for coffee

Now I didn't do this experiment for kicks

or for the coffee

I did it because the critical skill in the stcentury workplace

is going to be to collaborate with the technologies

that are becoming such a big and costly part of our daily working lives

And from what I was seeing we are struggling to cope with that

So it might sound counterintuitive

but by embracing the idea that these machines are actually valuable colleagues

we as people will perform better

and be happier

So let's all share a bit of humanity

towards the technologies and the softwares and the algorithms

and the robots who we work with

because we will all be the better for it

Thank you

We all know that saving is important

and is something that we should be doing

And yet overall we're doing less and less of it

[The Way We Work]
[]
We know what we need to do

The question is How do we do it

And that's what I'm here to teach you

Your savings behavior isn't a question of how smart you are

or how much willpower you have

The amount we save depends on the environmental cues around us

Let me give you an example

We ran a study in which in one group

we showed people their income on a monthly basis

In another group we showed people their income on a weekly basis

And what we found was that people who saw their income on a weekly basis

were able to budget better throughout the month

Now it's important to know

that we didn't change how much money people were receiving

we just changed the environment in which they understood their income

And environmental cues like this have an impact

So I'm not going to share tricks with you that you already know

I'm not going to tell you how to open up a savings account

or how to start saving for your retirement

What I am going to share with you is how to bridge this gap

from your intentions to save

and your actions

Are you ready

Here's number one

harness the power of precommitment

Fundamentally we think about ourselves in two different ways

our present self and our future self

In the future we're perfect

In the future we're going to save for retirement

we're going to lose weight

we're going to call our parents more

But we oftentimes forget that our future self

is exactly the same person as our present self

We know that one of the best times to save is when you get your tax return

So we tried an AB test
AB
In the first group we texted people in early February

hopefully before they even filed for their taxes

And we asked them

If you get a tax refund what percentage would you like to save

Now this is a really hard question

They didn't know if they would receive a tax refund or how much

But we asked the question anyway

In the second group we asked people right after they received their refund

What percentage would you like to save

Now here's what happened

In that second condition when people just received their tax refund

they wanted to save about  percent of their tax refund

But in the condition when we asked people before they even filed their taxes

savings rates increased from  percent to  percent

when we asked in February

Why

Because you're committing for your future self

and of course your future self can save  percent

These large changes in savings behavior

came from the fact that we changed the decisionmaking environment

We want you to be able to harness that same power

So take a moment

and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self

for something that you know today will be a little bit hard

Sign up for an app that lets you make savings decisions in advance

The trick is you have to have that binding contract

Number two use transition moments to your advantage

We did an experiment with a website

that helps older adults share their housing

We ran two ads on social media

targeted to the same population of yearolds

In one group we said Hey you're getting older

Are you ready for retirement

House sharing can help

In the second group we got a little bit more specific

and said You're  turning 

Are you ready for retirement

House sharing can help

What we're doing in that second group

is highlighting that a transition is happening

All of a sudden

we saw clickthrough rates and ultimately signup rates increase

when we highlight that

In psychology we call this the fresh start effect

Whether it's the start of a new year or even a new season

your motivation to act increases

So right now put a meeting request on your calendar

for the day before your next birthday

Identify the one financial thing you most want to do

And commit yourself to it

The third and final trick

get a handle on small frequent purchases

We've run a few different studies

and found that the number one purchase people say they regret after bank fees

is eating out

It's a frequent purchase we make almost every day

and it's death by a thousand cuts

A coffee here a burrito there 

It adds up and decreases our ability to save

Back when I lived in New York City

I looked at my expenses

and saw that I spent over  dollars on ridesharing apps

It was more than my New York City rent

I vowed to make a change

And the next month I spent  dollars again 

no change because the information alone didn't change my behavior

I didn't change my environment

So now that I was  dollars in the hole I did two things

The first is that I unlinked my credit card

from my carsharing apps

Instead I linked a debit card that only had  dollars a month

If I needed more

I had to go through the whole process of adding a new card

and we know that every click every barrier changes our behavior

We aren't machines

We don't carry around an abacus every day

adding up what we're spending in comparison to what we wanted

But what our brains are very good at

is counting up the number of times we've done something

So I gave myself a limit

I can only use ridesharing apps three times a week

It forced me to ration my travels

I got a handle on my carsharing expenses to the benefit of my husband

because of the environmental changes that I did

So get a handle on whatever that purchase is for you

and change your environment to make it harder to do so

Those are my tips for you

But I want you to remember one thing

As human beings we can be irrational when it comes to saving

and spending and budgeting

But luckily we know this about ourselves

and we can predict how we'll act under certain environments

Let's do that with saving

Let's change our environment to help our future selves

Almost  years ago

psychiatrists Richard Rahe and Thomas Holmes developed an inventory
Richard RaheThomas Holmes
of the most distressing human experiences that we could have

Number one on the list Death of a spouse
 
Number two divorce Three marital separation

Now generally but not always

for those three to occur we need what comes in number seven on the list

which is marriage

Laughter

Fourth on the list is imprisonment in an institution

Now some say number seven has been counted twice

Laughter

I don't believe that

When the life stress inventory was built

back then a longterm relationship pretty much equated to a marriage

Not so now

So for the purposes of this talk I'm going to be including

de facto relationships commonlaw marriages

and samesex marriages

or samesex relationships soon hopefully to become marriages

And I can say from my work with samesex couples

the principles I'm about to talk about are no different

They're the same across all relationships

So in a modern society

we know that prevention is better than cure

We vaccinate against polio diphtheria tetanus whooping cough measles

We have awareness campaigns for melanoma stroke diabetes 

all important campaigns

But none of those conditions come close

to affecting  percent of us

Fortyfive percent that's our current divorce rate

Why no prevention campaign for divorce

Well I think it's because our policymakers don't believe

that things like attraction and the way relationships are built

is changeable or educable

Why

Well our policymakers currently are Generation X
X
They're in their s to s

And when I'm talking to these guys about these issues

I see their eyes glaze over

and I can see them thinking

Doesn't this crazy psychiatrist get it

You can't control the way in which people attract other people

and build relationships

Not so our dear millennials

This is the most informationconnected analytical and skeptical generation

making the most informed decisions of any generation before them

And when I talk to millennials I get a very different reaction

They actually want to hear about this

They want to know about how do we have relationships that last

So for those of you who want to embrace the post romantic destiny era with me

let me talk about my three life hacks for preventing divorce

Now we can intervene to prevent divorce at two points

later once the cracks begin to appear in an established relationship

or earlier before we commit before we have children

And that's where I'm going to take us now

So my first life hack

millennials spend sevenplus hours on their devices a day

That's American data

And some say probably not unreasonably

this has probably affected their facetoface relationships

Indeed and add to that the hookup culture

ergo apps like Tinder
Tinder
and it's no great surprise that the somethings that I work with

will often talk to me about how it is often easier for them

to have sex with somebody that they've met

than have a meaningful conversation

Now some say this is a bad thing

I say this is a really good thing

It's a particularly good thing

to be having sex outside of the institution of marriage

Now before you go out and get all moral on me

remember that Generation X in the American Public Report
X
they found that  percent of women

had had premarital sex by the age of 

Ninetyone percent

It's a particularly good thing that these relationships are happening later

See boomers in the 's 

they were getting married at an average age for women of 

and  for men

 in Australia

That is now  for women and  for men

That's a good thing because the older you are when you get married

the lower your divorce rate

Why

Why is it helpful to get married later

Three reasons

Firstly getting married later allows the other two preventers of divorce

to come into play

They are tertiary education

and a higher income which tends to go with tertiary education

So these three factors all kind of get mixed up together

Number two

neuroplasticity research tell us

that the human brain is still growing until at least the age of 

So that means how you're thinking and what you're thinking

is still changing up until 

And thirdly and most importantly to my mind is personality

Your personality at the age of 

does not correlate with your personality at the age of 

But your personality at the age of 

does correlate with your personality at the age of 

So when I ask somebody who got married young why they broke up

and they say We grew apart

they're being surprisingly accurate

because the s is a decade of rapid change and maturation

So the first thing you want to get before you get married is older

Laughter

Number two

John Gottman psychologist and relationship researcher

can tell us many factors that correlate with a happy successful marriage

But the one that I want to talk about

is a big one

 percent of marriages implode selfdestruct if this problem is present

And the second reason why I want to talk about it here

is because it's something you can evaluate while you're dating

Gottman found that the relationships that were the most stable and happy

over the longer term

were relationships in which the couple shared power

They were influenceable

big decisions like buying a house overseas trips buying a car

having children

But when Gottman drilled down on this data

what he found was that women were generally pretty influenceable

Guess where the problem lay

Laughter

Yeah there's only two options here isn't there

Yeah we men were to blame

The other thing that Gottman found

is that men who are influenceable

also tended to be outstanding fathers

So women How influenceable is your man

Men

you're with her because you respect her

Make sure that respect plays out in the decisionmaking process

Number three

I'm often intrigued by why couples come in to see me

after they've been married for  or  years

This is a time when they're approaching the infirmities and illness of old age

It's a time when they're particularly focused on caring for each other

They'll forgive things that have bugged them for years

They'll forgive all betrayals even infidelities

because they're focused on caring for each other

So what pulls them apart

The best word I have for this is reliability

or the lack thereof

Does your partner have your back

It takes two forms

Firstly can you rely on your partner to do what they say they're going to do

Do they follow through

Secondly

if for example

you're out and you're being verbally attacked by somebody

or you're suffering from a really disabling illness

does your partner step up and do what needs to be done

to leave you feeling cared for and protected

And here's the rub

if you're facing old age

and your partner isn't doing that for you 

in fact you're having to do that for them 

then in an alreadyfragile relationship

it can look a bit like you might be better off out of it rather than in it

So is your partner there for you when it really matters

Not all the time  percent of the time

but particularly if it's important to you

On your side think carefully before you commit to do something for your partner

It is much better to commit to as much as you can follow through

than to commit to more soundgoodinthemoment

and then let them down

And if it's really important to your partner and you commit to it

make sure you move hell and high water to follow through

Now these are things that I'm saying you can look for

Don't worry these are also things that can be built

in existing relationships

I believe that the most important decision

that you can make

is who you choose as a life partner

who you choose as the other parent of your children

And of course romance has to be there

Romance is a grand and beautiful and quirky thing

But we need to add to a romantic loving heart

an informed thoughtful mind

as we make the most important decision of our life

Thank you

Workplace romance can be a tricky topic

Music

[The Way We Work]
[]
How do we manage the boundaries

between our personal and professional lives

How do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace

There's a lot of gray area in workplace romance

I'd like to take a few minutes

and answer some of your frequently asked questions

So question one Should I date my coworker

Uh  it depends

Do you want to date your coworker for a bit of fun

Do you want to date your coworker to hook up

Because then you're really better off on Tinder
Tinder
If you want to date your coworker

because you really sincerely think you're falling in love with them

or there's a real potential for a longterm committed relationship

maybe you should date your coworker

Studies show that your coworkers are generally positive about it

if they perceive that you're falling in love

and genuinely care about each other

It's when your coworkers sense that something else is in play 

that can be disruptive

Question two

Should I date my boss

In almost all cases no you should not date your boss

because now you've got a power dynamic

When there's a relationship between a boss and a subordinate

it generates a lot of negative feelings

and the negative feelings tend to fall on the person

who's lower on the totem pole

People usually assume some kind of favoritism

some kind of inside knowledge

and there can be resentment stirred up by that

There was a study published last year

that suggested dating a superior can even have a negative impact on your career

The researchers asked thirdparty evaluators online

to imagine that they worked at a law firm

They asked them to make recommendations on which employee should get picked

for a special training program

and which should get promoted to partner

They looked at credentials for imaginary employees

and when it was stated that an employee had been dating

or was in a relationship with a superior

the evaluators were less likely to pick that person for the training program

or the promotion

even if they had the exact same credentials

as someone who wasn't dating their boss

The evaluators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments

Question three

Can I date someone who reports to me

Still a big no

You may not feel like you're really the boss right

But you are and there's a power dynamic there

that's simply not there for other couples

If you really believe there is a sincere honestly felt personal connection

that would be lasting and meaningful

one of you may need to move

and it shouldn't always be the person who's lower in the company pecking order

Question four

I've just started seeing a coworker

How do we handle things

I get this question a lot

Are they dating Are they not dating
 
Don't keep it a secret

You don't have to make a big deal of it but secrecy tends to be corrosive

People tend to see workplace couples as a coalition or a unit

so try to make it clear to your coworkers that you're not the same person

you love each other but you are going to disagree

Question five

Why are coworkers often attracted to each other

Well the obvious answer is people tend to be attracted to each other

the more time they spend together

But there's another ingredient that has to be added

attraction tends to happen

when there's work that demands close collaboration

So imagine you have a big group project with a tight deadline

and you're working late nights and brainstorming ideas

You look up and across the table

one of your colleagues throws out a really great idea

You may feel something and that's natural

We call this task interdependence

It's a ripe ground for attraction

The second reason why people at work are attracted to each other

is they may often be similar to each other

There's two old adages

Birds of a feather flock together And Opposites attract
 
Well the psychological research suggests 

birds of a feather flock together

and we like people who are like us

Question six

My coworkers are flirting

I'm annoyed What do I do

Some researchers argue that for people flirting at work

flirting is good and it boosts creativity

But my own research suggests things are different

for people who are watching or who are subjected to the flirting

It can be awkward right

Witnessing flirtation in the workplace creates a sense of not knowing the rules

not knowing what's going on

or maybe seeing something that you shouldn't be seeing

People who frequently witness flirting at work 

they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs

and they feel less valued by their company

They're more likely to give a negative appraisal of the work environment

and they may even consider leaving

For women this association can be even stronger

This appears to be the case

even when people report not being bothered by the flirting

It's true even when they say they enjoy it

So a flirtatious environment really could be toxic

Question seven

Do I need a policy on workplace relationships

You certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment

and I think most HR departments recognize that

But for the kind of consensual behavior we've been talking about

it's a little different

As much as people in HR would love to wave a magic wand

and say Thou shall not fall in love at work

it's just not realistic

Emotional connection and sexuality is who we are

I kind of want you to flip the script a little bit

I encourage HR to really think more broadly

about their role in not necessarily stamping out office romance

because I don't think that's realistic

but how do I help create a workplace climate and culture

where people feel respected for their individual contributions

not for their appearance or their gender

or their personal relationships

So the larger question is

how do you make sure people are valued and respected

When I was 

I lost my grandfather to a silent heart attack

What happened to be more shocking was that at 

grandpa was really normal healthy and energetic

but he was diabetic

Learning all of this was so painful

that I decided to go out on a war against this deadly killer

and see what could be done

It was shocking to discover the results of recent studies

that have shown an estimate of nearly eight million people

who die from heart attacks every year

Heart attacks occur for many reasons

but most often they occur when arteries get clogged

blood flow is cut off

and oxygenstarved cells in the heart muscles start to die

You may know the common symptoms of a heart attack

chest pain arm pain shortness of breath fatigue et cetera 

but there is a type of heart attack that is quite common

just as deadly

but harder to detect because the symptoms are silent

People having silent heart attacks just don't realize what's happening

so they're not seeking medical attention

which means they're less likely to receive the treatment that they need

at the critical moment

And even if they do get to the hospital by chance

either before or after they are struck by a heart attack

they might have to go through one or more of these timeconsuming expensive tests

and treatments

which are currently considered the gold standards

of heartattack diagnosis

The greater concern however

is that these silent heart attacks account for nearly  percent

of all heart attacks

Patients with diabetes and similar disorders suffer from nerve damage

that prevents them from feeling the sort of pain

that usually signals to someone

that he or she may be having a heart attack

Which means they suffer the damage of a heart attack

without even knowing or feeling anything

These already atrisk patients suffer from nerve damage

and they do not get immediate medical care

They do not know anything before an unlikely event is about to occur

My grandfather was an atrisk patient too

I probed this issue further 

read as much as I could to understand the heart

met researchers and worked across labs in India

And finally after three long years of persistent research

what I have to share with the world today is a promising solution

A noninvasive device that is inexpensive

portable wearable by atrisk patients at all times

It greatly reduces the need for a blood test

and works  collecting and analyzing data at preset intervals

And all this data is collected for a single purpose

detecting heart attacks as they occur

This is a very promising solution that might help us in the future

You may not know how intelligent your heart really is

It tries to communicate to your body multiple times before failing

by indicating symptoms like chest pain

These symptoms are triggered when the heart loses out

on oxygenrich blood flow

But remember I told you about the nerve damage

It silences these symptoms before a silent heart attack

which makes it even deadlier

And you may not even know the common symptoms

Meanwhile the heart also sends out certain biomarkers 

cardiac biomarkers or proteins that are SOS messages 
SOS
in the form of SOS messages 
SOS
into your bloodstream

indicating that the heart is at risk

As it gets riskier and riskier

the concentrations of these cardiac biomarker proteins

keep increasing abysmally

My device solely relies on this data

The key is that these cardiac biomarkers are found

in one of the earliest stages of a heart attack

when someone is almost sure to survive

if he or she gets prompt care

And my device is solely based on that basis

And here's how my device works

A silicon patch is worn around your wrist or placed near your chest

Without having to prick your skin for a biomarker blood test

this patch can spot isolate and track a heartattack specific biomarker

called HFABP
HFABP
and alerts you if and when it reaches a critical level in your bloodstream 

a process that's much simpler easier and cheaper than conventional methods

of heartattack diagnosis

By checking on biomarker concentration data

a system like this with advanced research in the future

could significantly reduce the need for an atrisk patient to go to a doctor

for a biomarker blood test

because the device could be worn at all times

sensing biomarker elevations in real time

Thus if the device senses the biomarker levels going beyond the critical point

the atrisk patient could be warned of an impending cardiac arrest

and that he or she needs immediate medical attention

Although the device may not be able to provide the patient

with the complete analysis of the cardiac injury

it might be of immense help

in actually indicating that the patient is in danger

so that the patient can be alarmed

and know that immediate care is crucial

Every atrisk patient will now receive more time to survive

and reach out for medical help

Consequently they don't have to go

for expensive and invasive medical treatments

that would otherwise be necessary after a heart attack

When I got my device tested on atrisk patients under observation

results from the clinical validation tests

certified close to a  percent accuracy and sensitivity

I intend to make my device available to people in two variants

one which gives digital analysis of the biomarker levels

and a simpler version for the people in rural areas

which simply vibrates when the biomarker levels go beyond the critical point

When we look at our progress in cardiac health care today

it is more of sick care than preventative selfcare and technology

We literally wait for the heart attack to occur

and put our vast majority of resources into postcare treatment

But by then irreversible damage will already be done

I firmly believe it's time for us to rethink medicine

We must establish proactive healthcare technologies

A change must be brought out not  years from now

not five years from now

but today

And so hopefully one day

with the help of these devices

someone else won't lose his or her grandfather just like I did

Thank you so much

Colfax Avenue here in Denver Colorado
Colfax
was once called the longest wickedest street in America

My office is there in the same place  it's a medical desert

There are government clinics and hospitals nearby

but they're not enough to handle the poor who live in the area

By poor I mean those who are on Medicaid

Not just for the homeless  percent of this country is on Medicaid
 
If your neighbors have a family of four and make less than  a year

then they can get Medicaid

But they can't find a doctor to see them

A study by Merritt Hawkins

found that only  percent of the family doctors in Denver

take any Medicaid patients

And of those  percent some have caps like five Medicaid patients a month

Others make Medicaid patients wait months to be seen

but will see you today if you have Blue Cross

This form of classist discrimination is legal

and is not just a problem in Denver

Almost half the family doctors in the country

refuse to see Medicaid patients

Why

Well because Medicaid pays less than private insurance

and because Medicaid patients are seen as more challenging

Some show up late for appointments some don't speak English

and some have trouble following instructions

I thought about this while in medical school

If I could design a practice that caters to lowincome folks

instead of avoiding them

then I would have guaranteed customers and very little competition

Laughter

So after residency I opened up shop doing underserved medicine

Not as a nonprofit but as a private practice

A small business seeing only resettled refugees

That was six years ago

and since then we've served  refugee medical visits

Applause

Ninety percent of our patients have Medicaid

and most of the rest we see for free

Most doctors say you can't make money on Medicaid

but we're doing it just fine

How

Well if this were real capitalism then I wouldn't tell you

because you'd become my competition

Laughter

But I call this bleedingheart capitalism

Laughter

And we need more people doing this not less so here's how

We break down the walls of our medical maze

by taking the challenges of Medicaid patients

turning them into opportunities and pocketing the difference

The nuts and bolts may seem simple but they add up

For example we have no appointments

We're walkin only

Of course that's how it works at the emergency room

at urgent cares and at Taco Bell

Laughter

But not usually at family doctor's offices

Why do we do it

Because Nasra can't call for an appointment

She has a phone but she doesn't have phone minutes

She can't speak English and she can't navigate a phone tree

And she can't show up on time for an appointment

because she doesn't have a car she takes the bus

and she takes care of three kids plus her disabled father

So we have no appointments

she shows up when she wants

but usually waits less than  minutes to be seen

She then spends as much time with us as she needs

Sometimes that's  minutes usually it's less than five

She loves this flexibility

It's how she saw doctors in Somalia

And I love it because I don't pay staff to do scheduling

and we have a zero noshow rate and a zero lateshow rate

Laughter

Applause

It makes business sense

Another difference is our office layout

Our exam rooms open right to the waiting room

our medical providers room their own patients

and our providers stay in one room instead of alternating between rooms

Cutting steps cuts costs and increases customer satisfaction

We also hand out free medicines right from our exam room

overthecounter ones and some prescription ones too

If Nasra's baby is sick

we put a bottle of children's Tylenol or amoxicillin right in her hand

She can take that baby straight back home instead of stopping at the pharmacy

I don't know about you but I get sick just looking at all those choices

Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there

We also text patients

We're open evenings and weekends

We do home visits

We've jumped dead car batteries

Laughter

With customer satisfaction so high we've never had to advertise

yet are growing at  percent a year

And we've become real good at working with Medicaid

since it's pretty much the only insurance company we deal with

Other doctor's offices chase  insurance companies

just to make ends meet

That's just draining

A singlepayer system is like monogamy it just works better

Laughter

Applause

Of course Medicaid is funded by tax payers like you

so you might be wondering How much does this cost the system

Well we're cheaper than the alternatives

Some of our patients might go to the emergency room

which can cost thousands just for a simple cold

Some may stay home and let their problems get worse

But most would try to make an appointment at a clinic that's part of the system

called the Federally Qualified Health Centers

This is a nationwide network of safetynet clinics

that receive twice as much government funding per visit

than private doctors like me

Not only they get more money

but by law there can only be one in each area

That means they have a monopoly on special funding for the poor

And like any monopoly

there's a tendency for cost to go up and quality to go down

I'm not a government entity I'm not a nonprofit
 
I'm a private practice

I have a capitalist drive to innovate

I have to be fast and friendly

I have to be costeffective and culturally sensitive

I have to be tall dark and handsome

Laughter

Applause

And if I'm not I'm going out of business

I can innovate faster than a nonprofit

because I don't need a meeting to move a stapler

Applause

Really none of our innovations are new or unique 

we just put them together in a unique way

to help lowincome folks while making money

And then instead of taking that money home

I put it back into the refugee community as a business expense

This is Mango House

My version of a medical home

In it we have programs to feed and clothe the poor

an afterschool program English classes

churches dentist legal help mental health and the scout groups

These programs are run by tenant organizations

and amazing staff

but all receive some amount of funding form profits from my clinic

Some call this social entrepreneurship

I call it socialservice arbitrage

Exploiting inefficiencies in our health care system to serve the poor

We're serving  refugees a year

at less cost than where else they would be going

Of course there's downsides to doing this as a private business

rather than as a nonprofit or a government entity

There's taxes and legal exposures

There's changing Medicaid rates and specialists who don't take Medicaid

And there's bomb threats

Notice there's no apostrophes it's like

We were going to blow up all you refugees

Laughter

We were going to blow up all you refugees

but then we went to your English class instead

Laughter

Applause

Now you might be thinking This guy's a bit different

Laughter

Uncommon

Laughter

A communal narcissist

Laughter

A unicorn maybe

because if this was so easy then other doctors would be doing it

Well based on Medicaid rates you can do this in most of the country

You can be your own boss

help the poor and make good money doing it

Medical folks

you wrote on your school application essays

that you wanted to help those less fortunate

But then you had your idealism beaten out of you in training

Your creativity bred out of you

It doesn't have to be that way

You can choose underserved medicine as a lifestyle specialty

Or you can be a specialist

who cuts cost in order to see lowincome folks

And for the rest of you who don't work in health care

what did you write on your applications

Most of us wanted to save the world to make a difference

Maybe you've been successful in your career

but are now looking for that meaning

How can you get there

I don't just mean giving a few dollars or a few hours

I mean how can you use your expertise to innovate new ways of serving others

It might be easier than you think

The only way we're going to bridge the underserved medicine gap

is by seeing it as a business opportunity

The only way we're going to bridge the inequality gap

is by recognizing our privileges and using them to help others

Applause

There are two powerful phenomena unfolding on earth

the rise of global warming

and the rise of women and girls

The link between them is often overlooked

but gender equity is a key answer to our planetary challenge

Let me explain

For the last few years

I have been working on an effort called Project Drawdown
Drawdown
Our team has scoured humanity's wisdom

for solutions to draw down heattrapping climatechanging emissions

in the atmosphere 

not someday maybe if we're lucky solutions

the  best practices and technologies

already in hand

clean renewable energy including solar and wind

green buildings both new and retrofitted

efficient transportation from Brazil to China

thriving ecosystems through protection and restoration

reducing waste and reclaiming its value

growing food in good ways that regenerates soil

shifting diets to less meat more plants

and equity for women and girls

Gender and climate are inextricably linked

Drawing down emissions depends on rising up

First a bit of context

We are in a situation of urgency severity and scope

never before faced by humankind

So far our response isn't anywhere close to adequate

But you already know that

You know it in your gut

in your bones

We are each part of the planet's living systems

knitted together with almost  billion human beings

and  million known species

We can feel the connections between us

We can feel the brokenness

and the closing window to heal it

This earth our home

is telling us that a better way of being must emerge and fast

In my experience to have eyes wide open

is to hold a broken heart every day

It's a grief that I rarely speak

though my work calls on the power of voice

I remind myself that the heart can simply break or it can break open

A brokenopen heart is awake and alive and calls for action

It is regenerative like nature

reclaiming ruined ground growing anew

Life moves inexorably toward more life

toward healing

toward wholeness

That's a fundamental ecological truth

And we all of us

we are life force

On the face of it the primary link between women girls and a warming world

is not life but death

Awareness is growing that climate impacts hit women and girls hardest

given existing vulnerabilities

There is greater risk of displacement

higher odds of being injured or killed during a natural disaster

Prolonged drought can precipitate early marriage

as families contend with scarcity

Floods can force lastresort prostitution

as women struggle to make ends meet

The list goes on and goes wide

These dynamics are most acute under conditions of poverty

from New Orleans to Nairobi

Too often the story ends here

But not today

Another empowering truth begs to be seen

If we gain ground on gender equity

we also gain ground on addressing global warming

This connection comes to light in three key areas

three areas where we can secure the rights of women and girls

shore up resilience

and avert emissions at the same time

Women are the primary farmers of the world

They produce  to  percent of food in lowerincome countries

often operating on fewer than five acres

That's what the term smallholder means

Compared with men women smallholders have less access to resources

including land rights

credit and capital training

tools and technology

They farm as capably and efficiently as men

but this welldocumented disparity in resources and rights

means women produce less food on the same amount of land

Close those gaps

and farm yields rise by  to  percent

That means  to  percent more food from the same garden or the same field

The implications for hunger for health for household income 

they're obvious

Let's follow the thread to climate

We humans need land to grow food

Unfortunately forests are often cleared to supply it

and that causes emissions from deforestation

But if existing farms produce enough food

forests are less likely to be lost

So there's a ripple effect

Support women smallholders

realize higher yields

avoid deforestation

and sustain the lifegiving power of forests

Project Drawdown estimates that addressing inequity in agriculture
Project Drawdown
could prevent two billion tons of emissions between now and 

That's on par with the impact household recycling can have globally

Addressing this inequity can also help women cope

with the challenges of growing food

as the climate changes

There is life force in cultivation

At last count

 million girls are still denied their basic right to attend school

Gaps are greatest in secondary school classrooms

Too many girls are missing a vital foundation for life

Education means better health for women and their children

better financial security

greater agency at home and in society

more capacity to navigate a climatechanging world

Education can mean options adaptability strength

It can also mean lower emissions

For a variety of reasons

when we have more years of education

we typically choose to marry later

and to have fewer children

So our families end up being smaller

What happens at the individual level adds up across the world and over time

One by one by one

the right to go to school impacts how many human beings live on this planet

and impacts its living systems

That's not why girls should be educated

It's one meaningful outcome

Education is one side of a coin

The other is family planning

access to highquality voluntary reproductive health care

To have children by choice rather than chance

is a matter of autonomy and dignity

Yet in the US

 percent of pregnancies are unintended

Two hundred and fourteen million women in lowerincome countries

say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant

but aren't using contraception

Listening to women's needs

addressing those needs

advancing equity and wellbeing

those must be the aims of family planning period

Curbing the growth of our human population

is a side effect though a potent one

It could dramatically reduce demand for food transportation electricity

buildings goods and all the rest

thereby reducing emissions

Close the gaps on access to education and family planning

and by midcentury we may find one billion fewer people inhabiting earth

than we would if we do nothing more

According to Project Drawdown
Drawdown
one billion fewer people could mean we avoid

nearly  billion tons of emissions

At that level of impact

gender equity is a top solution to restore a climate fit for life

At that level of impact

gender equity is on par with wind turbines

and solar panels and forests

There is life force in learning

and life force in choice

Now let me be clear

this does not mean women and girls are responsible for fixing everything

Laughter

Though we probably will

Laughter

Applause

Equity for women in agriculture education and family planning

these are solutions within a system of drawdown solutions

Together they comprise a blueprint of possibility

And let me be even clearer about this

population cannot be seen in isolation from production or consumption

Some segments of the human family cause exponentially greater harm

while others suffer outsized injustice

The most affluent 

we are the most accountable

We have the most to do

The genderclimate connection extends beyond negative impacts

and beyond powerful solutions

Women are vital voices and agents for change on this planet

and yet we're too often missing or even barred from the proverbial table

We're too often ignored or silenced when we speak

We are too often passed over

when plans are laid or investments made

According to one analysis

just  percent of philanthropic funds

go specifically towards women and the environment

merely  million dollars globally

the sum spent by one man on a single Basquiat painting last year
Basquiat
These dynamics are not only unjust they are setting us up for failure

To rapidly radically reshape society

we need every solution and every solver

every mind

every bit of heart

every set of hands

We often crave a simple call to action

but this challenge demands more than a fact sheet

and more than a checklist

We need to function more like an ecosystem

finding strength in our diversity

You know what your superpowers are

You're an educator farmer healer creator campaigner wisdomkeeper

How might you link arms where you are

to move solutions forward

There is one role I want to ask that all of you play

the role of messenger

This is a time of great awakening

We need to break the silence around the condition of our planet

move beyond manufactured debates about climate science

share solutions

speak truth with a brokenopen heart

teach that to address climate change we must make gender equity a reality

And in the face of a seemingly impossible challenge

women and girls are a fierce source of possibility

It is a magnificent thing to be alive

in a moment that matters so much

This earth

our home

is calling for us to be bold

reminding us we are all in this together 

women men

people of all gender identities

all beings

We are life force

one earth

one chance

Let's seize it

Thank you

Applause

Look all around you

Whether you're in a subway a park an airport a restaurant

even at this conference

all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets

How many of you have a book

Very few right

This is the sight that used to greet me

every time I walked out of my office block

I was surrounded by a sea of something professionals

glued to their phones

And not a single one had a book in their hands

And this used to make me very very frustrated

I was a bookworm all my life

Books formed the milestones of my life

The first man I fell in love with was Mr Darcy

I first read Harry Potter when I was  on a summer break from college

And I remember the first night I spent in a little flat I bought in my mids

very proudly

and I spent the whole night reading The Da Vinci Code

And then I'm going to make a terrible confession

even today when I'm low I get into bed with War and Peace

Don't laugh

Laughter

But I was also like all those people I saw around me

I too lived on my phone

I ordered my groceries online

and soon my app knew that I needed a monthly dose of diapers

I booked my cinemas on my phone

I booked planes on my phone

And when I did the long commute back home like most urban Indians

and was stuck in traffic

I passed the time on WhatsApp videochatting my twin
WhatsApp
I was part of an extraordinary revolution that was happening in India

Indians are the secondlargest users of smartphones in the world

And data prices have been slashed so radically

that half of urban India and even a part of rural India

now have a smartphone with a data connection in their hands

And if you know anything about India

you'll know that half means like all of America or something

You know it's large numbers

Laughter

And these numbers are just growing and growing and growing

They're exploding

And what they're doing is empowering Indians

in all kinds of extraordinary ways

And yet none of these changes that I was seeing around me

were reflected in my world my world of books

I live in a country the size of Europe

and it only has  decent bookshops

And Indians just didn't seem to want to read for fun

So if you look at all the bestseller lists in India

what you'll always find in the bestseller list

is exam and professional guides

Imagine if you found the SAT guides as the New York Times number one seller
SAT
month after month

And yet the smartphone revolution was creating readers and writers

of a different kind

Whether it was on Facebook or WhatsApp
FacebookWhatsApp
Indians were writing and sharing and reading all kinds of things

terrible jokes spurious pop history

long emotional confessions

diatribes against the government

And as I read and shared these things I wondered to myself

Could I get these writers and these readers

could I turn them into my readers

And so I left my plush corner office

and my job as the publisher of India's top publishing company

and I set up on my own

I moved into a single large room in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi

with a small team

And there I set up a new kind of publishing house

A new kind of publishing house needs a new kind of reader

and a new kind of book

And so I asked myself What would this new reader want

Would they prize urgency relevance

timeliness directness 

the very qualities they seem to want from their online services

indeed the qualities they seem to want from life today

I knew that my readers were always on the go

I'd have to fit into their lifestyle and schedules

Would they actually want to read a page book

Or would they want something a little bit more digestible

Indians are incredibly valueconscious

especially when it comes to their online reading

I knew I had to give them books under a dollar

And so my company was formed and it was born

It was a platform where we created a list of stories designed for the smartphone

but it also allowed amateur writers to upload their own stories

so they could be showcased along with the very writers

they read and admired

And we could also enter into other people's digital platforms

So imagine this

imagine you're a receptionist you've had a long day at work

you book your cab in your ridehailing app

it shows up

and you get into your car and you lie back on your seat

and you put on your app

And you find a set of stories waiting for you timed to your journey

Imagine you're a gay young woman

in a relatively conservative city like Lucknow which lies near Delhi

There's no way your parents know about your sexuality

They'd completely freak out

Would you like lesbian love stories written in Hindi priced under a dollar

to be read in the privacy of your phone

And could I match readers

to the events that were taking place around them in real time

So we published biographies of very famous politicians

after they won big elections

When the supreme court decriminalized homosexuality

an LGBTQ collection was waiting on our home page
LGBTQ
And when India's Toni Morrison the great writer Mahasweta Devi died

our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit

The idea was to be relevant to every moment of a reader's life

Who are our readers

They're mostly young men under the age of 

There's someone like Salil
Salil
who lives in a city where there isn't a modern bookshop

And he comes to our app almost every day

There's someone like Manoj

who mostly reads us during the long commute back home

And there's someone like Ahmed who loves our nonfiction

that he can read in a single sitting and that's priced very low

Imagine if you're like a young techie boy

in India's Silicon Valley city of Bangalore

And one day you get an inapp notification

and it says that your favorite actress has written a sexy short story

and it's waiting for you

That's how we launched Juggernaut
Juggernaut
We got a very famous exadult star called Sunny Leone

She's India's most Googled person as it happens

And we got her to write us a collection of sexy short stories

that we published every night for a week

And it was a sensation

I mean no one could believe that we'd asked Sunny Leone to write

But she did

and she proved everyone wrong

and she found this immense readership

And just as we've redefined what a book is and how a reader behaves

we're rethinking who an author is

In our amateur writing platform

we have writers that range from teenagers to housewives

And they're writing all kinds of things

It starts as small as a poem an essay a single short story 

Fifty percent of them are returning to the app to write again

Take someone like Neeraj
Neeraj
He's a middleaged executive wife two kids a good job

And Neeraj loves to read
Neeraj
But every time Neeraj read a book that he loved
Neeraj
he was also filled with regret

He wondered to himself if he could write too

He was convinced he had stories in his mind

But time and real life had happened and he couldn't really manage it

And then he heard about the Juggernaut writer's platform

And what he loved about it was that he felt this was a place

where he could stand head and shoulders equally

with the very writers that he most admired

And so he began to write

And he snatched a minute here an hour there

in between flights in airports

late at night when he had a little bit of time on his hands

And he wrote this extraordinary story for us

He wrote a story about a family of assassins

who lived in the winding lanes of Old Delhi

We loved it it was so fresh and original

And before Neeraj knew it he'd not only scored a film deal
Neeraj
but also a second contract to write another story

Neeraj's story is one of the most read stories on our app
Neeraj
My journey is very very young

We're a twoyearold company and we have a long way to go

But we already and we will by the end of this year

have about half a million stories many priced at under a dollar

Most of our readers love reading

and trying out authors they've never ever heard of before

Thirty percent of our home page reads

comes out of the writing that comes from our writer's platform

By being everywhere

by being accessible and relevant

I hope to make reading a daily habit

as easy and effortless as checking your email

as booking a ticket online

or ordering your groceries

And as for me

I've discovered that as I entered the sixinch world of the smartphone

my own world just got very very big

Thank you

Applause

I got invited to an exclusive resort

to deliver a talk about the digital future

to what I assumed would be a couple of hundred tech executives

And I was there in the green room waiting to go on

and instead of bringing me to the stage they brought five men into the green room

who sat around this little table with me

They were tech billionaires

And they started peppering me with these really binary questions

like Bitcoin or Etherium

Virtual reality or augmented reality

I don't know if they were taking bets or what

And as they got more comfortable with me

they edged towards their real question of concern

Alaska or New Zealand

That's right

These tech billionaires were asking a media theorist for advice

on where to put their doomsday bunkers

We spent the rest of the hour on the single question

How do I maintain control of my security staff

after the event

By the event they mean the thermonuclear war

or climate catastrophe or social unrest that ends the world as we know it

and more importantly makes their money obsolete

And I couldn't help but think

these are the wealthiest most powerful men in the world

yet they see themselves as utterly powerless to influence the future

The best they can do is hang on for the inevitable catastrophe

and then use their technology and money to get away from the rest of us

And these are the winners of the digital economy

Laughter

The digital renaissance

was about the unbridled potential

of the collective human imagination

It spanned everything from chaos math and quantum physics

to fantasy roleplaying and the Gaia hypothesis right

We believed that human beings connected could create any future we could imagine

And then came the dot com boom

And the digital future became stock futures

And we used all that energy of the digital age

to pump steroids into the already dying NASDAQ stock exchange

The tech magazines told us a tsunami was coming

And only the investors who hired the best scenarioplanners and futurists

would be able to survive the wave

And so the future changed from this thing we create together in the present

to something we bet on

in some kind of a zerosum winnertakesall competition

And when things get that competitive about the future

humans are no longer valued for our creativity

No now we're just valued for our data

Because they can use the data to make predictions

Creativity if anything that creates noise

That makes it harder to predict

So we ended up with a digital landscape

that really repressed creativity repressed novelty

it repressed what makes us most human

We ended up with social media

Does social media really connect people in new interesting ways

No social media is about using our data to predict our future behavior

Or when necessary to influence our future behavior

so that we act more in accordance with our statistical profiles

The digital economy  does it like people

No if you have a business plan what are you supposed to do

Get rid of all the people

Human beings they want health care they want money they want meaning

You can't scale with people

Laughter

Even our digital apps 

they don't help us form any rapport or solidarity

I mean where's the button on the ride hailing app

for the drivers to talk to one another about their working conditions

or to unionize

Even our videoconferencing tools

they don't allow us to establish real rapport

However good the resolution of the video

you still can't see if somebody's irises are opening to really take you in

All of the things that we've done to establish rapport

that we've developed over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution

they don't work

you can't see if someone's breath is syncing up with yours

So the mirror neurons never fire the oxytocin never goes through your body

you never have that experience of bonding with the other human being

And instead you're left like

Well they agreed with me but did they really

did they really get me

And we don't blame the technology for that lack of fidelity

We blame the other person

You know even the technologies and the digital initiatives that we have

to promote humans

are intensely antihuman at the core

Think about the blockchain

The blockchain is here to help us have a great humanized economy No
 
The blockchain does not engender trust between users

the blockchain simply substitutes for trust in a new

even less transparent way

Or the code movement

I mean education is great we love education

and it's a wonderful idea

that we want kids to be able to get jobs in the digital future

so we'll teach them code now

But since when is education about getting jobs

Education wasn't about getting jobs

Education was compensation for a job well done

The idea of public education

was for coal miners who would work in the coal mines all day

then they'd come home and they should have the dignity

to be able to read a novel and understand it

Or the intelligence to be able to participate in democracy

When we make it an extension of the job what are we really doing

We're just letting corporations really

externalize the cost of training their workers

And the worst of all really is the humane technology movement

I mean I love these guys the former guys who used to take

the algorithms from Las Vegas slot machines

and put them in our social media feed so that we get addicted

Now they've seen the error of their ways

and they want to make technology more humane

But when I hear the expression humane technology

I think about cagefree chickens or something

We're going to be as humane as possible to them

until we take them to the slaughter

So now they're going to let these technologies be as humane as possible

as long as they extract enough data and extract enough money from us

to please their shareholders

Meanwhile the shareholders for their part they're just thinking

I need to earn enough money now so I can insulate myself

from the world I'm creating by earning money in this way

Laughter

No matter how many VR goggles they slap on their faces

and whatever fantasy world they go into

they can't externalize the slavery and pollution that was caused

through the manufacture of the very device

It reminds me of Thomas Jefferson's dumbwaiter
Thomas Jefferson
Now we like to think that he made the dumbwaiter

in order to spare his slaves all that labor of carrying the food

up to the dining room for the people to eat

That's not what it was for it wasn't for the slaves

it was for Thomas Jefferson and his dinner guests

so they didn't have to see the slave bringing the food up

The food just arrived magically

like it was coming out of a Start Trek replicator

It's part of an ethos that says

human beings are the problem and technology is the solution

We can't think that way anymore

We have to stop using technology to optimize human beings for the market

and start optimizing technology for the human future

But that's a really hard argument to make these days

because humans are not popular beings

I talked about this in front of an environmentalist just the other day

and she said Why are you defending humans

Humans destroyed the planet They deserve to go extinct

Laughter

Even our popular media hates humans

Watch television

all the scifi shows are about how robots are better and nicer than people

Even zombie shows  what is every zombie show about

Some person looking at the horizon at some zombie going by

and they zoom in on the person and you see the person's face

and you know what they're thinking

What's really the difference between that zombie and me

He walks I walk

He eats I eat

He kills I kill

But he's a zombie

At least you're aware of it

If we are actually having trouble distinguishing ourselves from zombies

we have a pretty big problem going on

Laughter

And don't even get me started on the transhumanists

I was on a panel with a transhumanist and he's going on about the singularity

Oh the day is going to come really soon when computers are smarter than people

And the only option for people at that point

is to pass the evolutionary torch to our successor

and fade into the background

Maybe at best upload your consciousness to a silicon chip

And accept your extinction

Laughter

And I said No human beings are special

We can embrace ambiguity we understand paradox

we're conscious we're weird we're quirky

There should be a place for humans in the digital future

And he said Oh Rushkoff

you're just saying that because you're a human

Laughter

As if it's hubris

OK I'm on Team Human

That was the original insight of the digital age

That being human is a team sport

evolution's a collaborative act

Even the trees in the forest

they're not all in competition with each other

they're connected with the vast network of roots and mushrooms

that let them communicate with one another and pass nutrients back and forth

If human beings are the most evolved species

it's because we have the most evolved ways of collaborating and communicating

We have language

We have technology

It's funny I used to be the guy who talked about the digital future

for people who hadn't yet experienced anything digital

And now I feel like I'm the last guy

who remembers what life was like before digital technology

It's not a matter of rejecting the digital or rejecting the technological

It's a matter of retrieving the values that we're in danger of leaving behind

and then embedding them in the digital infrastructure for the future

And that's not rocket science

It's as simple as making a social network

that instead of teaching us to see people as adversaries

it teaches us to see our adversaries as people

It means creating an economy that doesn't favor a platform monopoly

that wants to extract all the value out of people and places

but one that promotes the circulation of value through a community

and allows us to establish platform cooperatives

that distribute ownership as wide as possible

It means building platforms

that don't repress our creativity and novelty in the name of prediction

but actually promote creativity and novelty

so that we can come up with some of the solutions

to actually get ourselves out of the mess that we're in

No instead of trying to earn enough money to insulate ourselves

from the world we're creating

why don't we spend that time and energy making the world a place

that we don't feel the need to escape from

There is no escape there is only one thing going on here

Please don't leave

Join us

We may not be perfect

but whatever happens at least you won't be alone

Join Team Human

Find the others

Together let's make the future that we always wanted

Oh and those tech billionaires who wanted to know

how to maintain control of their security force after the apocalypse

you know what I told them

Start treating those people with love and respect right now

Maybe you won't have an apocalypse to worry about

Thank you

Applause

How many decisions have been made about you today

or this week or this year

by artificial intelligence

I build AI for a living

so full disclosure I'm kind of a nerd

And because I'm kind of a nerd

wherever some new news story comes out

about artificial intelligence stealing all our jobs

or robots getting citizenship of an actual country

I'm the person my friends and followers message

freaking out about the future

We see this everywhere

This media panic that our robot overlords are taking over

We could blame Hollywood for that

But in reality that's not the problem we should be focusing on

There is a more pressing danger a bigger risk with AI
AI
that we need to fix first

So we are back to this question

How many decisions have been made about you today by AI
AI
And how many of these

were based on your gender your race or your background

Algorithms are being used all the time

to make decisions about who we are and what we want

Some of the women in this room will know what I'm talking about

if you've been made to sit through those pregnancy test adverts on YouTube
YouTube
like  times

Or you've scrolled past adverts of fertility clinics

on your Facebook feed
Facebook
Or in my case Indian marriage bureaus

Laughter

But AI isn't just being used to make decisions

about what products we want to buy

or which show we want to binge watch next

I wonder how you'd feel about someone who thought things like this

A black or Latino person

is less likely than a white person to pay off their loan on time

A person called John makes a better programmer

than a person called Mary

A black man is more likely to be a repeat offender than a white man

You're probably thinking

Wow that sounds like a pretty sexist racist person right

These are some real decisions that AI has made very recently
AI
based on the biases it has learned from us

from the humans

AI is being used to help decide whether or not you get that job interview
AI
how much you pay for your car insurance

how good your credit score is

and even what rating you get in your annual performance review

But these decisions are all being filtered through

its assumptions about our identity our race our gender our age

How is that happening

Now imagine an AI is helping a hiring manager

find the next tech leader in the company

So far the manager has been hiring mostly men

So the AI learns men are more likely to be programmers than women
AI
And it's a very short leap from there to

men make better programmers than women

We have reinforced our own bias into the AI

And now it's screening out female candidates

Hang on if a human hiring manager did that

we'd be outraged we wouldn't allow it

This kind of gender discrimination is not OK

And yet somehow AI has become above the law

because a machine made the decision

That's not it

We are also reinforcing our bias in how we interact with AI
AI
How often do you use a voice assistant like Siri Alexa or even Cortana
SiriAlexaCortana
They all have two things in common

one they can never get my name right

and second they are all female

They are designed to be our obedient servants

turning your lights on and off ordering your shopping

You get male AIs too but they tend to be more highpowered

like IBM Watson making business decisions
IBM
Salesforce Einstein or ROSS the robot lawyer
Salesforce EinsteinROSS
So poor robots even they suffer from sexism in the workplace

Laughter

Think about how these two things combine

and affect a kid growing up in today's world around AI

So they're doing some research for a school project

and they Google images of CEO
CEO
The algorithm shows them results of mostly men

And now they Google personal assistant

As you can guess it shows them mostly females

And then they want to put on some music and maybe order some food

and now they are barking orders at an obedient female voice assistant

Some of our brightest minds are creating this technology today

Technology that they could have created in any way they wanted

And yet they have chosen to create it in the style of s Mad Man secretary

Yay

But OK don't worry

this is not going to end with me telling you

that we are all heading towards sexist racist machines running the world

The good news about AI is that it is entirely within our control

We get to teach the right values the right ethics to AI
AI
So there are three things we can do

One we can be aware of our own biases

and the bias in machines around us

Two we can make sure that diverse teams are building this technology

And three we have to give it diverse experiences to learn from

I can talk about the first two from personal experience

When you work in technology

and you don't look like a Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk

your life is a little bit difficult your ability gets questioned

Here's just one example

Like most developers I often join online tech forums

and share my knowledge to help others

And I've found

when I log on as myself with my own photo my own name

I tend to get questions or comments like this

What makes you think you're qualified to talk about AI

What makes you think you know about machine learning

So as you do I made a new profile

and this time instead of my own picture I chose a cat with a jet pack on it

And I chose a name that did not reveal my gender

You can probably guess where this is going right

So this time I didn't get any of those patronizing comments about my ability

and I was able to actually get some work done

And it sucks guys

I've been building robots since I was 

I have a few degrees in computer science

and yet I had to hide my gender

in order for my work to be taken seriously

So what's going on here

Are men just better at technology than women

Another study found

that when women coders on one platform hid their gender like myself

their code was accepted four percent more than men

So this is not about the talent

This is about an elitism in AI

that says a programmer needs to look like a certain person

What we really need to do to make AI better

is bring people from all kinds of backgrounds

We need people who can write and tell stories

to help us create personalities of AI
AI
We need people who can solve problems

We need people who face different challenges

and we need people who can tell us what are the real issues that need fixing

and help us find ways that technology can actually fix it

Because when people from diverse backgrounds come together

when we build things in the right way

the possibilities are limitless

And that's what I want to end by talking to you about

Less racist robots less machines that are going to take our jobs 

and more about what technology can actually achieve

So yes some of the energy in the world of AI

in the world of technology

is going to be about what ads you see on your stream

But a lot of it is going towards making the world so much better

Think about a pregnant woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo

who has to walk  hours to her nearest rural prenatal clinic

to get a checkup

What if she could get diagnosis on her phone instead

Or think about what AI could do
AI
for those one in three women in South Africa

who face domestic violence

If it wasn't safe to talk out loud

they could get an AI service to raise alarm

get financial and legal advice

These are all real examples of projects that people including myself

are working on right now using AI

So I'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story

about the existential risk

robots taking over and coming for your jobs

Laughter

And when something like that happens

I know I'll get the same messages worrying about the future

But I feel incredibly positive about this technology

This is our chance to remake the world into a much more equal place

But to do that we need to build it the right way from the get go

We need people of different genders races sexualities and backgrounds

We need women to be the makers

and not just the machines who do the makers' bidding

We need to think very carefully what we teach machines

what data we give them

so they don't just repeat our own past mistakes

So I hope I leave you thinking about two things

First I hope you leave thinking about bias today

And that the next time you scroll past an advert

that assumes you are interested in fertility clinics

or online betting websites

that you think and remember

that the same technology is assuming that a black man will reoffend

Or that a woman is more likely to be a personal assistant than a CEO

And I hope that reminds you that we need to do something about it

And second

I hope you think about the fact

that you don't need to look a certain way

or have a certain background in engineering or technology

to create AI

which is going to be a phenomenal force for our future

You don't need to look like a Mark Zuckerberg

you can look like me

And it is up to all of us in this room

to convince the governments and the corporations

to build AI technology for everyone

including the edge cases

And for us all to get education

about this phenomenal technology in the future

Because if we do that

then we've only just scratched the surface of what we can achieve with AI
AI
Thank you

Applying for jobs online

is one of the worst digital experiences of our time

And applying for jobs in person really isn't much better

[The Way We Work]
[]
Hiring as we know it is broken on many fronts

It's a terrible experience for people

About  percent of people

who applied to jobs using various methods in the past year

said they never heard anything back from the employer

And at the company level it's not much better

 percent of people get fired or quit

within the first year of starting their jobs

It's pretty mindblowing

It's also bad for the economy

For the first time in history

we have more open jobs than we have unemployed people

and to me that screams that we have a problem

I believe that at the crux of all of this is a single piece of paper the rsum

A rsum definitely has some useful pieces in it

what roles people have had computer skills

what languages they speak

but what it misses is what they have the potential to do

that they might not have had the opportunity to do in the past

And with such a quickly changing economy where jobs are coming online

that might require skills that nobody has

if we only look at what someone has done in the past

we're not going to be able to match people to the jobs of the future

So this is where I think technology can be really helpful

You've probably seen that algorithms have gotten pretty good

at matching people to things

but what if we could use that same technology

to actually help us find jobs that we're really wellsuited for

But I know what you're thinking

Algorithms picking your next job sounds a little bit scary

but there is one thing that has been shown

to be really predictive of someone's future success in a job

and that's what's called a multimeasure test

Multimeasure tests really aren't anything new

but they used to be really expensive

and required a PhD sitting across from you

and answering lots of questions and writing reports

Multimeasure tests are a way

to understand someone's inherent traits 

your memory your attentiveness

What if we could take multimeasure tests

and make them scalable and accessible

and provide data to employers about really what the traits are

of someone who can make them a good fit for a job

This all sounds abstract

Let's try one of the games together

You're about to see a flashing circle

and your job is going to be to clap when the circle is red

and do nothing when it's green

[Ready]
[]
[Begin]
[]
[Green circle]
[]
[Green circle]
[]
[Red circle]
[]
[Green circle]
[]
[Red circle]
[]
Maybe you're the type of person

who claps the millisecond after a red circle appears

Or maybe you're the type of person

who takes just a little bit longer to be  percent sure

Or maybe you clap on green even though you're not supposed to

The cool thing here is that this isn't like a standardized test

where some people are employable and some people aren't

Instead it's about understanding the fit between your characteristics

and what would make you good a certain job

We found that if you clap late on red and you never clap on the green

you might be high in attentiveness and high in restraint

People in that quadrant tend to be great students great testtakers

great at project management or accounting

But if you clap immediately on red and sometimes clap on green

that might mean that you're more impulsive and creative

and we've found that topperforming salespeople often embody these traits

The way we actually use this in hiring

is we have top performers in a role go through neuroscience exercises

like this one

Then we develop an algorithm

that understands what makes those top performers unique

And then when people apply to the job

we're able to surface the candidates who might be best suited for that job

So you might be thinking there's a danger in this

The work world today is not the most diverse

and if we're building algorithms based on current top performers

how do we make sure

that we're not just perpetuating the biases that already exist

For example if we were building an algorithm based on top performing CEOs
CEO
and use the SP  as a training set
S
you would actually find

that you're more likely to hire a white man named John than any woman

And that's the reality of who's in those roles right now

But technology actually poses a really interesting opportunity

We can create algorithms that are more equitable

and more fair than human beings have ever been

Every algorithm that we put into production has been pretested

to ensure that it doesn't favor any gender or ethnicity

And if there's any population that's being overfavored

we can actually alter the algorithm until that's no longer true

When we focus on the inherent characteristics

that can make somebody a good fit for a job

we can transcend racism classism sexism ageism 

even good schoolism

Our best technology and algorithms shouldn't just be used

for helping us find our next movie binge or new favorite Justin Bieber song

Imagine if we could harness the power of technology

to get real guidance on what we should be doing

based on who we are at a deeper level

So a few years ago

I was beginning a new unit on race with my fourthgraders

And whenever we start a new unit

I like to begin by having all the students list everything they know about it

and then we also list questions we have

And I had the type of moment that every teacher has nightmares about

One of my students had just asked the question

Why are some people racist

And another student let's call her Abby

had just raised her hand and volunteered

Maybe some people don't like black people because their skin is the color of poop

Yeah I know

So as if on cue my entire class exploded

Half of them immediately started laughing

and the other half started yelling at Abby

and shouting things like

Oh my God you can't say that that's racist

So just take a second to freeze this scene in your mind

There's a class of nine and tenyearolds

and half of them are in hysterics

because they think Abby has said something wildly funny

and the other half are yelling at her for saying something offensive

And then you have Abby sitting there completely bewildered

because in her mind she doesn't understand the weight of what she said

and why everybody is reacting this way

And then you have me the teacher

standing there in the corner like about to have a panic attack

So as a classroom teacher

I have to make splitsecond decisions all the time

And I knew I needed to react but how

Consider your fightorflight instincts

I could fight by raising my voice and reprimanding her for her words

Or flight  just change the subject

and quickly start reaching for another subject

like anything to get my students' minds off the word poop

However as we know the right thing to do is often not the easy thing to do

And as much as I wanted this moment to be over

and that I knew both of these options would help me escape the situation

I knew that this was far too important of a teachable moment to miss

So after standing there for what felt like an eternity

I unfroze and I turned to face my class and I said

Actually Abby makes a point

And my students kind of looked at each other all confused

And I continued

One reason why racism exists

is because people with light skin have looked at people with dark skin

and said that their skin was ugly

And even use this reason as an excuse to dehumanize them

And the reason why we're learning about race and racism in the first place

is to educate ourselves to know better

And to understand why comments like this are hurtful

and to make sure that people with dark skin

are always treated with respect and kindness

Now this was a truly terrifying teachable moment

But as we moved forward in the conversation

I noticed that both Abby and the rest of the kids

were still willing to engage

And as I watched the conversation really marinate with my students

I began to wonder how many of my students have assumptions just like Abby

And what happens when those assumptions go unnoticed and unaddressed

as they so often do

But first I think it's important to take a step back

and even consider what makes a topic taboo

I don't remember receiving an official list of things

you're not supposed to talk about

But I do remember hearing over and over growing up

there are two things you do not talk about at family gettogethers

And those two things are religion and politics

And I always thought this was very curious

because religion and politics often are such huge influencing factors

over so many of our identities and beliefs

But what makes a topic taboo

is that feeling of discomfort that arises when these things come up in conversation

But some people are extremely fluent in the language of equity

while other people fear being PCshamed

or that their ignorance will show as soon as they open their mouths

But I believe that the first step towards holding conversations

about things like equity

is to begin by building a common language

And that actually starts with destigmatizing topics

that are typically deemed taboo

Now conversations around race for example

have their own specific language

and students need to be fluent in this language

in order to have these conversations

Now schools are often the only place

where students can feel free and comfortable

to ask questions and make mistakes

But unfortunately not all students feel that sense of security

Now I knew that day in front of my fourthgraders

that how I chose to respond could actually have lifelong implications

not only for Abby but for the rest of the students in my class

If I had brushed her words aside

the rest of the class could actually infer that this type of comment is acceptable

But if I had yelled at Abby

and embarrassed her in front of all of her friends

that feeling of shame associated with one of her first conversations on race

could actually prevent her from ever engaging on that topic again

Now teaching kids about equity in schools is not teaching them what to think

It is about giving them the tools and strategies and language

and opportunities to practice how to think

For example think about how we teach kids how to read

We don't start by giving them books

We start by breaking down words into letters and sounds

and we encourage them to practice their fluency by reading every single day

with a partner or with their friends

And we give them lots of comprehension questions

to make sure that they're understanding what they're reading

And I believe that teaching kids about equity

should be approached in the exact same way

I like to start by giving my students a survey every year

about different issues around equity and inclusion

And this is a sample survey from one of my kids

and as you can see there's some humor in here

For under the question What is race

she has written When two or more cars people and animals

run to see who is fastest and who wins

However if you look at her question What is racism

it says When somebody says or calls someone darkskinned a mean name

So she's young but she's showing that she's beginning to understand

And when we act

like our students aren't capable of having these conversations

we actually do them such a disservice

Now I also know that these types of conversations

can seem really really intimidating with our students

especially with young learners

But I have taught first through fifth grades

and I can tell you for example

that I'm not going to walk into a firstgrade classroom

and start talking about things like mass incarceration

But even a sixyearold firstgrader can understand the difference

between what is fair  people getting what they need

We identified a lot of these things in class together

And the difference between fair and equal 

when everybody gets the same thing

especially goody bags at birthday parties

Now firstgraders can also understand the difference

between a punishment and a consequence

And all of these things are foundational concepts

that anyone needs to understand

before having a conversation

about mass incarceration in the United States

Some people might think that kindergarteners or firstgraders

are too young to have conversations around racism

but also tell you that young kids

understand that there are many different components

that make up our identities

and how people are similar and different

and what it means to have power when other people don't

When we have these conversations with students at a young age

it actually takes away some of that taboo feeling

when those topics come up at a later age

I also know that teaching about these things in schools

can feel like navigating a minefield

For example what happens if parents or families

aren't on board with having these conversations in schools

But to these people I can say

these are some examples of things that students have said to me

and brought to my attention

For example I had a student come in and whisper to me

I've heard all these people use the term LGBTQ
LGBTQ
but I don't know what it means and I'm too embarrassed to admit it

I had a student come in over a weekend and come up to me and say

You know I just watched this movie about Australia

and it made me wonder if they have racism there too

And I always want my students to be comfortable having these conversations

because when they're comfortable talking about it and asking questions

they also build comfort in bringing in their own lives and experiences

in how they relate to these big topics

Also some teachers might be kind of nervous

if a student brings up a topic or asks a question

and they don't know the answer to it

But if a student ever brings something to my attention

and I don't know the answer

I will always admit it and own it

because I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in something

that I don't have experience in or I'm not an authority on

That same year I had a student come in

and ask a question about the LGBTQ community
LGBTQ
And I just didn't know enough to give them an appropriate answer

So instead I encouraged that student

to reach out and ask that question to a representative of a nonprofit

who had come to speak to our class about that very same issue

When we admit to our students that we don't have all the answers

not only does it humanize us to them

it also shows them that adults have a long way to go too

when it comes to learning about issues of equity

Now a little while back I wrote a lesson about consent

And to some people this was very exciting

because I took this topic that seemed very taboo and scary

and I broke it down into a way that was accessible for young learners

However to other people

the idea of consent is so strongly tied to sex

and sex is often considered a taboo subject

that it made them very uncomfortable

But my students are thirdgraders

so we're not talking about sex in class

Rather I wanted them to understand

that everybody has different physical boundaries

that make them feel comfortable

And the social and emotional intelligence it takes

to read somebody's words and tone and body language

are skills that often need to be explicitly taught

the same way we teach things like reading and math

And this lesson is not reserved for students of one single demographic

Things like questioning and making observations

and critical thinking

are things that any student of any race or ethnicity

or background or language or income or zip code should be learning in schools

Also deliberate avoidance of these conversations

speaks volumes to our students

because kids notice when their teachers when their textbooks

leave out the voices and experiences of people like women or people of color

Silence speaks volumes

I recently asked my class of thirdgraders

what they would say to adults who think they're too young

to learn about issues of equity

And while this is a small sample of my  students

all of them agreed

that not only are they capable of having these conversations

but they view it the right to learn it as a right and not as a privilege

And in their words

We're big enough to know about these things

because these problems are happening where we live

And we have the right to talk about them

because it will be our life in the future

Thank you

At this very moment

with every breath we take

major delta cities across the globe are sinking

including New York London

Tokyo Shanghai New Orleans

and as well as my city Bangkok

Here is the usual version of climate change

This is mine

Nothing much

just a crocodile on the street

Laughter

This is an urgent impact of climate change

over sinking cities

Here you can see the urbanization of Bangkok

growing in every direction

shifting from porous agricultural land 

the land that can breathe and absorb water 

to a concrete jungle

This is what parts of it look like after  minutes of rainfall

And every time it rains

I wish my car could turn into a boat

This land has no room for water

It has lost its absorbent capacity

The reality of Bangkok's metropolitan region

is a city of  million people

living working and commuting on top of a shifting muddy river delta

Bangkok is sinking more than one centimeter per year

which is four times faster than the rate of predicted sea level rise

And we could be below sea level by 

which will be here too soon

There is no coincidence that I am here as a landscape architect

As a child I grew up in a row house

next to the busy road always filled with traffic

In front of my house there was a concrete parking lot

and that was my playground

The only living creature I would find

and had fun with

were these sneaky little plants trying to grow through the crack

of the concrete pavement

My favorite game with friends

was to dig a bigger and bigger hole through this crack

to let this little plant creep out 

sneak out more and more

And yes landscape architecture

gives me the opportunity to continue my cracking ambition 

Laughter

to connect this concrete land back to nature

Before Thais  my people 

we were adapted to the cycle of the wet and dry season

and you could call us amphibious

Laughter

We lived both on land and on water

We were adapted to both

And flooding was a happy event when the water fertilized our land

But now flooding means 

disaster

In 

Thailand was hit by the most damaging and the most expensive flood disaster

in our history

Flooding has turned central Thailand into an enormous lake

Here you can see the scale of the flood in the center of the image

to the scale of Bangkok outlined in yellow

The water was overflowing from the north

making its way across several provinces

Millions of my people

including me and my family

were displaced and homeless

Some had to escape the city

Many were terrified of losing their home and their belongings

so they stayed back in the flood with no electricity and clean water

For me this flood reflects clearly

that our modern infrastructure

and especially our notion of fighting flood with concrete

had made us so extremely vulnerable to the climate uncertainty

But in the heart of this disaster

I found my calling

I cannot just sit and wait as my city continues to sink

The city needed me

and I had the ability to fix this problem

Six years ago

I started my project

My teams and I won the design competition for Chulalongkorn Centenary Park

This was the big bold mission of the first university in Thailand

for celebrating its hundredth anniversary

by giving this piece of land as a public park to our city

Having a park sounds very normal to many other cities

but not in Bangkok

which has one of the lowest public green space per capita

among megacities in Asia

Our project's become the first new public park

in almost  years

The acre park 

a big green crack at the heart of Bangkok 

opened just last year

Applause and cheers

Thank you

Applause

For four years we have pushed through countless meetings

to convince and never give up to convincing

that this park isn't just for beautification or recreation

it must help the city deal with water

it must help the city confront climate change

And here is how it works

Bangkok is a flat city

so we harnessed the power of gravity by inclining the whole park

to collect every drop of rain

The gravity force pulls down the runoff from the highest point

to the lowest point

This park has three main elements that work as one system

The first  the green roof

This is the biggest green roof in Thailand

with the rainwater tanks and museum underneath

In the dry season

the collected rain can be used to water the park for up to a month

The runoff on the green roof then falls through wetlands

with the native water plants that can help filter

and help clean water

And at the lower end

the retention pond collects all of the water

At this pond there are water bikes

People can pedal and help clean water

Their exercise becomes an active part of the park water system

When life gives you a flood

you have fun with the water

Laughter

Centenary Park gives room for people and room for water

which is exactly what we and our cities need

This is an amphibious design

This park is not about getting rid of flood

It's about creating a way to live with it

And not a single drop of rain is wasted in this park

This park can hold and collect a million gallons of water

Applause

Thank you

Applause

Every given project for me is an opportunity

to create more green cracks through this concrete jungle

by using landscape architecture as a solution

like turning this concrete roof into an urban farm

which can help absorb rain

reduce urban heat island

and grow food in the middle of the city

reuse the abandoned concrete structure

to become a green pedestrian bridge

and another floodproof park at Thammasat University
Thammasat
which nearly completes the biggest green roof on an academic campus yet

in Southeast Asia

Severe flooding is our new normal

putting the southeast Asian region 

the region with the most coastline 

at extreme risk

Creating a park is just one solution

The awareness of climate change

means we in every profession we are involved

are increasingly obligated to understand the climate risk

and put whatever we are working on as part of the solution

Because if our cities continue

the way they are now

a similar catastrophe will happen again 

and again

Creating a solution in these sinking cities

is like making the impossible possible

And for that

I would like to share one word that I always keep in mind

that is tangjai

The literal translation for tang is to firmly stand

and jai means heart
jaiheart
Firmly stand your heart at your goal

In Thai language when you commit to do something

you put tangjai in front of your word

so your heart will be in your action

No matter how rough the path

how big the crack

you push through to your goal

because that's where your heart is

And yes Thailand is home

This land is my only home

and that's where I firmly stand my heart

Where do you stand yours

Thank you

Applause

Thank you

So I want to talk to you about the forgotten middle

To me they are the students coworkers and plain old regular folks

who are often overlooked

because they're seen as neither exceptional nor problematic

They're the kids we think we can ignore

because their needs for support don't seem particularly urgent

They're the coworkers

who actually keep the engines of our organizations running

but who aren't seen as the innovators who drive excellence

In many ways we overlook the folks in the middle

because they don't keep us up awake at night

wondering what crazy thing they're going to come up with next

Laughter

And the truth is that we've come to rely on their complacency

and sense of disconnection

because it makes our work easier

You see I know a little bit about the forgotten middle

As a junior high school student I hung out in the middle

For a long time I had been a good student

But seventh grade was a game changer

I spent my days gossiping passing notes

generally goofing off with my friends

I spent my homework time on the phone reviewing each day's events

And in many ways although I was a typical yearold girl

my ambivalence about my education led to pretty average grades

Luckily for me my mother understood something important

and that was that my location was not my destination

As a former research librarian and an educator

my mother knew that I was capable of accomplishing a lot more

But she also understood

that because I was a young black woman in America

I might not have opportunities out of the middle

if she wasn't intentional about creating them

So she moved me to a different school

She signed me up for leadership activities in my neighborhood

And she began to talk to me more seriously

about college and career options I could aspire to

My mother's formula for getting me out of the middle was pretty simple

She started with high expectations

She made it her business to figure out how to set me up for success

She held me accountable

and along the way she convinced me that I had the power

to create my own story

That formula didn't just help me get out of my seventh grade slump 

I used it later on in New York City

when I was working with kids who had a lot of potential

but not a lot of opportunities to go to and complete college

You see highperforming students

tend to have access to additional resources

like summer enrichment activities

internships

and an expansive curriculum

that takes them out of the classroom and into the world

in ways that look great on college applications

But we're not providing those kinds of opportunities for everyone

And the result isn't just that some kids miss out

I think we as a society miss out too

You see I've got a crazy theory about the folks in the middle

I think there are some unclaimed winning lottery tickets in the middle

I think the cure for cancer and the path to world peace

might very well reside there

Now as a former middle school teacher

I'm not saying that magically everyone is suddenly going to become an A student
A
But I also believe that most folks in the middle

are capable of a lot more

And I think people stay in the middle because that's where we relegated them to

and sometimes that's just where they're kind of chilling

while they figure things out

All of our journeys

are made up of a series of rest stops accelerations losses and wins

We have a responsibility to make sure

that one's racial gender cultural and socioeconomic identity

is never the reason you didn't have access out of the middle

So just as my mother did with me

I began with high expectations with my young people

And I started with a question

I stopped asking kids Hey do you want to go to college

I started asking them

What college would you like to attend

You see the first question 

Applause

The first question leaves a lot of vague possibilities open

But the second question

says something about what I thought my young people were capable of

On a basic level

it assumes that they're going to graduate from high school successfully

It also assumed

that they would have the kinds of academic records

that could get them college and university admissions

And I'm proud to say that the high expectations worked

While black and Latinx students

nationally tend to graduate from college in six years or less

at a percent of 

we were recognized by the College Board

for our ability not to just get kids into college

but to get them through college

Applause

But I also understand that high expectations are great

but it takes a little bit more than that

You wouldn't ask a pastry chef to bake a cake without an oven

And we should not be asking the folks in the middle to make the leap

without providing them with the tools strategies and support they deserve

to make progress in their lives

A young woman I had been mentoring for a long time Nicole

came to my office one day

after her guidance counselor looked at her pretty strong transcript

and expressed utter shock and amazement

that she was even interested in going to college

What the guidance counselor didn't know was that through her community

Nicole had had access to college prep work

SAT prep and international travel programs
Sat prep
Not only was college in her future

but I'm proud to say that Nicole went on to earn two master's degrees

after graduating from Purdue University

Applause

We also made it our business to hold our young people accountable

but also to instill a sense of accountability in those young people

to themselves to each other to their families and their communities

We doubled down on assetbased youth development

We went on leadership retreats

and did high ropes courses and low ropes courses

and tackled life's biggest questions together

The result was that the kids really bought into the notion

that they were accountable for achieving these college degrees

It was so gratifying to see the kids calling each other and texting each other

to say Hey why are you late for SAT prep
SAT
And What are you packing for the college tour tomorrow

We really worked to kind of make college the thing to do

We began to create programs on college campuses

and events that allow young people to really visualize themselves

as college students and college graduates

Me and my staff rocked our own college gear

and had lots of fun healthy competition about whose school was better than whose

The kids really bought into it

and they began to see that something more was possible for their lives

Not only that  they could look around at that collegegoing community

and see kids who came from the same backgrounds

and the same neighborhoods

and who were aspiring to the same things

That sense of belonging was really key

and it showed up in a remarkable beautiful way one day

when we were in the Johannesburg airport waiting to go through customs

on our way to Botswana for a service learning trip

I saw a group of kids kind of huddled in a circle

Usually with teens that means something's going on

Laughter

So I kind of walked up behind the kids

to figure out what they were talking about

They were comparing passport stamps

Laughter

And they were dreaming out loud about all the other countries

they planned to visit in the future

And seeing these young people from New York City

go on to not just become college students

but to participate in study abroad programs

and to then take jobs around the world

was incredibly gratifying

When I think of my kids

and all the doctors lawyers teachers social workers

journalists and artists

who came from our little nook in New York City

I hate to think of what would have happened

if we hadn't invested in the middle

Just think about all that their communities and the world

would have missed out on

This formula for the middle doesn't just work with young people

It can transform our organizations as well

We can be more bold

in coming up and articulating a mission that inspires everyone

We can authentically invite our colleagues to the table

to come up with a strategy to meet the mission

We can give meaningful feedback to folks along the way

and  and sometimes most importantly 

make sure that you're sharing credit for everyone's contributions

What happened when my staff aimed high for themselves

is that what they were able to do for young people

was pretty transformational

And it's been so wonderful to look back and see all of my former colleagues

who've gone on to get doctorates

and assume leadership roles in other organizations

We have what it takes to inspire and uplift the folks in the middle

We can extend love to the people in the middle

We can challenge our own biases about who deserves a handup and how

We can structure our organizations communities and institutions

in ways that are inclusive and that uphold principles of equity

Because in the final analysis what is often mistaken for a period

is really just a comma

Thank you

Applause

I could fit all movies ever made inside of this tube

If you can't see it that's kind of the point

Laughter

Before we understand how this is possible

it's important to understand the value of this feat

All of our thoughts and actions these days

through photos and videos 

even our fitness activities 

are stored as digital data

Aside from running out of space

on our phones

we rarely think about our digital footprint

But humanity has collectively generated more data

in the last few years

than all of preceding human history

Big data has become a big problem

Digital storage is really expensive

and none of these devices that we have really stand the test of time

There's this nonprofit website called the Internet Archive

In addition to free books and movies

you can access web pages as far back as 

Now this is very tempting

but I decided to go back and look at the TED website's very humble beginnings
TED
As you can see it's changed quite a bit in the last  years

So this led me to the firstever TED
TED
back in 

and it just so happened to be a Sony executive

explaining how a compact disk works

Laughter

Now it's really incredible to be able to go back in time

and access this moment

It's also really fascinating that after  years after that first TED
TED
we're still talking about digital storage

Now if we look back another  years

IBM released the firstever hard drive
IBM
back in 

Here it is being loaded for shipping in front of a small audience

It held the equivalent of one MP song
MP
and weighed over one ton

At  dollars a megabyte

I don't think anyone in this room would be interested in buying this thing

except maybe as a collector's item

But it's the best we could do at the time

We've come such a long way in data storage

Devices have evolved dramatically

But all media eventually wear out or become obsolete

If someone handed you a floppy drive today to back up your presentation

you'd probably look at them kind of strange maybe laugh

but you'd have no way to use the damn thing

These devices can no longer meet our storage needs

although some of them can be repurposed

All technology eventually dies or is lost

along with our data

all of our memories

There's this illusion that the storage problem has been solved

but really we all just externalize it

We don't worry about storing our emails and our photos

They're just in the cloud

But behind the scenes storage is problematic

After all the cloud is just a lot of hard drives

Now most digital data we could argue is not really critical

Surely we could just delete it

But how can we really know what's important today

We've learned so much about human history

from drawings and writings in caves

from stone tablets

We've deciphered languages from the Rosetta Stone

You know we'll never really have the whole story though

Our data is our story

even more so today

We won't have our record recorded on stone tablets

But we don't have to choose what is important now

There's a way to store it all

It turns out that there's a solution that's been around

for a few billion years

and it's actually in this tube

DNA is nature's oldest storage device
DNA
After all it contains all the information necessary

to build and maintain a human being

But what makes DNA so great
DNA
Well let's take our own genome

as an example

If we were to print out all three billion A's T's C's and G's
ATCG
on a standard font standard format

and then we were to stack all of those papers

it would be about  meters high

somewhere between the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument

Now if we converted all those A's T's C's and G's
ATCG
to digital data to zeroes and ones

it would total a few gigs

And that's in each cell of our body

We have more than  trillion cells

You get the idea

DNA can store a ton of information in a minuscule space
DNA
DNA is also very durable
DNA
and it doesn't even require electricity to store it

We know this because scientists have recovered DNA from ancient humans
DNA
that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago

One of those is tzi the Iceman

Turns out he's Austrian

Laughter

He was found high wellpreserved

in the mountains between Italy and Austria

and it turns out that he has living genetic relatives here in Austria today

So one of you could be a cousin of tzi

Laughter

The point is that we have a better chance of recovering information

from an ancient human

than we do from an old phone

It's also much less likely that we'll lose the ability to read DNA
DNA
than any single manmade device

Every single new storage format requires a new way to read it

We'll always be able to read DNA
DNA
If we can no longer sequence we have bigger problems

than worrying about data storage

Storing data on DNA is not new
DNA
Nature's been doing it for several billion years

In fact every living thing is a DNA storage device
DNA
But how do we store data on DNA
DNA
This is Photo 

It's the firstever photo of DNA
DNA
taken about  years ago

This is around the time that that same hard drive was released by IBM
IBM
So really our understanding of digital storage and of DNA have coevolved
DNA
We first learned to sequence or read DNA
DNA
and very soon after how to write it

or synthesize it

This is much like how we learn a new language

And now we have the ability to read write and copy DNA
DNA
We do it in the lab all the time

So anything really anything that can be stored as zeroes and ones

can be stored in DNA
DNA
To store something digitally like this photo

we convert it to bits or binary digits

Each pixel in a blackandwhite photo is simply a zero or a one

And we can write DNA much like an inkjet printer can print letters on a page
DNA
We just have to convert our data all of those zeroes and ones

to A's T's C's and G's
ATCG
and then we send this to a synthesis company

So we write it we can store it

and when we want to recover our data we just sequence it

Now the fun part of all of this is deciding what files to include

We're serious scientists so we had to include a manuscript

for good posterity

We also included a  Amazon gift card 

don't get too excited it's already been spent someone decoded it 

as well as an operating system

one of the first movies ever made

and a Pioneer plaque

Some of you might have seen this

It has a depiction of a typical  apparently  male and female

and our approximate location in the Solar System

in case the Pioneer spacecraft ever encounters extraterrestrials

So once we decided what sort of files we want to encode

we package up the data

convert those zeroes and ones to A's T's C's and G's
ATCG
and then we just send this file off to a synthesis company

And this is what we got back

Our files were in this tube

All we had to do was sequence it

This all sounds pretty straightforward

but the difference between a really cool fun idea

and something we can actually use

is overcoming these practical challenges

Now while DNA is more robust than any manmade device
DNA
it's not perfect

It does have some weaknesses

We recover our message by sequencing the DNA
DNA
and every time data is retrieved

we lose the DNA
DNA
That's just part of the sequencing process

We don't want to run out of data

but luckily there's a way to copy the DNA
DNA
that's even cheaper and easier than synthesizing it

We actually tested a way to make  trillion copies of our files

and we recovered all the data without error

So sequencing also introduces errors into our DNA
DNA
into the A's T's C's and G's
ATCG
Nature has a way to deal with this in our cells

But our data is stored in synthetic DNA in a tube
DNA
so we had to find our own way to overcome this problem

We decided to use an algorithm that was used to stream videos

When you're streaming a video

you're essentially trying to recover the original video the original file

When we're trying to recover our original files

we're simply sequencing

But really both of these processes are about recovering enough zeroes and ones

to put our data back together

And so because of our coding strategy

we were able to package up all of our data

in a way that allowed us to make millions and trillions of copies

and still always recover all of our files back

This is the movie we encoded

It's one of the first movies ever made

and now the first to be copied more than  trillion times on DNA
DNA
Soon after our work was published

we participated in an Ask Me Anything on the website reddit
Reddit
If you're a fellow nerd you're very familiar with this website

Most questions were thoughtful

Some were comical

For example one user wanted to know when we would have a literal thumb drive

Now the thing is

our DNA already stores everything needed to make us who we are
DNA
It's a lot safer to store data on DNA
DNA
in synthetic DNA in a tube
DNA
Writing and reading data from DNA is obviously a lot more timeconsuming
DNA
than just saving all your files on a hard drive 

for now

So initially we should focus on longterm storage

Most data are ephemeral

It's really hard to grasp what's important today

or what will be important for future generations

But the point is we don't have to decide today

There's this great program by UNESCO called the Memory of the World program

It's been created to preserve historical materials

that are considered of value to all of humanity

Items are nominated to be added to the collection

including that film that we encoded

While a wonderful way to preserve human heritage

it doesn't have to be a choice

Instead of asking the current generation  us 

what might be important in the future

we could store everything in DNA
DNA
Storage is not just about how many bytes

but how well we can actually store the data and recover it

There's always been this tension between how much data we can generate

and how much we can recover

and how much we can store

Every advance in writing data has required a new way to read it

We can no longer read old media

How many of you even have a disk drive in your laptop

never mind a floppy drive

This will never be the case with DNA
DNA
As long as we're around DNA is around
DNA
and we'll find a way to sequence it

Archiving the world around us is part of human nature

This is the progress we've made in digital storage in  years

at a time when we were only beginning to understand DNA
DNA
Yet we've made similar progress in half that time with DNA sequencers
DNA
and as long as we're around DNA will never be obsolete

Every year more than four to five million people die

due to exposure to outdoor air pollution

around the world

This petri dish that you are looking at

contains approximately  minutes' worth of pollution

captured off a pyrolysis plant

This is PM 
PM
These particles  you can see it right now

but when they're out there in the air you won't see them

These are so tiny that our lungs 

our bodies cannot filter them and they end up in our bodies 

give us asthma and lung cancer if not treated in the right time

On a trip back to India when I was a student in 

I took this picture

This picture stuck in my head

On one side you see this exhaust of a diesel generator

the same generator which is a sign of human progress

which is a sign of rapid industrialization

and what we have become as a society in the last  years

generating energy

But on the other side

you see this very interesting triangular blackcolored swatch

that is produced by the same residual particulate waste

created by the emissions of the generator

Now this picture gave me an idea

and got me thinking about rethinking both pollution and inks

because it was making that blackcolored mark

Now the reality is that most of the black ink that we use conventionally

is traditionally produced

by conventionally burning fossil fuels in factories

There are factories around the world that are burning fossil fuels

to produce carbon black

to make black inks that we use on an everyday basis

But given that millions of liters of fossil fuels

are already being burned out there

by our cars our engines and our exhaust out there

what if you could capture that pollution

and use it to recycle and make those inks

I decided to give this experiment a shot

I went back to my lab back in Boston and conducted a small experiment

In Boston I couldn't find much pollution to play with

so I resorted to using a candle

This was an experiment

I burnt a candle

built this contraption that would suck in that candle soot

mixed it with some vegetable oil and vodka

because to a DIY hacker these were really easily available
DIY
Laughter

And after mixing them

you could churn out a very rudimentary form of ink

that would go into a cartridge

and now you could print with it

This was my Hello World of experimenting
 
with printing with pollution

This is the same pollution that I showed you in the petri dish

which is the result of any fossil fuel that is being burned out there

In  I decided to take this experimentation forward

and set up a lab in India

to work on the capture and recycling of air pollution

In the good times the lab used to look something like this

But experimentations were not always controlled

and disasters happened

And while experimentation would happen

the lab would end up looking something like this

Well we knew where we wanted to go

but we were not sure how exactly to reach there

The passersby who used to go by that lab through that building

used to at times think These guys are making bombs in there

because there was too much fire wires and smoke in the same vicinity

Laughter

We decided let's move to a garage and take experiments forward

We took a garage and during the early stages

we were driving around Bangalore with contraptions like these

This is an earlystage prototype

Imagine the looks people gave us

What are these cars driving around doing

This is an earlystage prototype of our system that would capture pollution

that is being released from a conventional dieselbased car

This is an early stage of the technology

We advanced the technology and created this into this version

that would capture pollution from static sources of pollution

like a diesel generator

If you see all the fumes disappear as soon as you turn this machine on

Without affecting the performance of the engine

we are able to capture  percent worth of pollution

released from the diesel generator

This is the particulate matter that we are talking about that we capture

in this case within three to four hours of operation of a generator

And while our experiments and our research was advancing

a very big company a very big brand approached us and said

We want to take this idea further with you guys

and take this further in a very big celebrated form

They said Let's do a global art campaign

with the inks that you are making off this pollution

I'll show you what the ink looks like

So this pen is made by recycling  to  minutes of that car pollution

that we are talking about

the same pollution that is in the petri dish

And it's a very sharp black that you can write with

So I'm going to write 

PM  that's incorrect
PM 
So this is a very sharp black that is generated by the same pollution

After much work on the lablevel research

we got an offer from a big corporation to do a very big trial of this idea

And it happened to be a brand and we didn't think twice

We said Let's go ahead

Inventing in the lab is one thing

and taking ideas and deploying them in the real world is completely another

During early stages

we had to resort to using our own houses and own kitchens

as our inkmaking factories

and our own bedrooms and living rooms

as the first assembly line for making these inks

This is my cofounder Nikhil's own bedroom

that is being used to supply inks to artists all around the world

who would paint with AIRINK
AIRInk
And that's him delivering AIRINKs to the ports

so that the artists around the world can use it

Soon we started seeing

that thousands of artists around the world started using AIRINK
AIRINK
and artworks started emerging like this

Soon thousands of blackandwhite pollutionmade artworks

started emerging on a global scale

And believe me for a group of scientists and engineers and inventors

there was nothing more satisfying than that the product of their work

is now being used by some of the finest artists around the world

This is the cover of Contagious magazine last year

that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our labs

This is a famous painting by the British artist Christian Furr

who painted it for the song Paint It Black by The Rolling Stones

Now there's more to this pen and this ink

than just the popular and popculture artworks

And now our goal is to create a company

that can actually make some black money  I mean just money 

Laughter

and highquality printing processes and inks

that can replace the conventional black inks

that have been produced for the last thousands of years around the world

Soon after our growing popularity and artworks around the world

we started facing a very different kind of a problem

We started getting spammed by polluters

who would send us bags full of pollution to our office address

asking us What can we do with this pollution

Our lab back in Bombay right now has pollution samples

that have come from London from India from China you name it

And this is just the beginning

This polluter sent us this specific image asking us

that these are all bags filled with PM 
PM
and can we recycle it for him if we paid him some money

Well what would he have done if we did not take that pollution

He would probably find a nearby river or a landfill and dump it over there

But now because we had the economics of AIRINK figured out on the other side
AIRINK
we could incentivize him to give us this pollution and make inks from it

and turn it into even more valuable products

Now pollution as we all know is a global killer

We can't claim that our ink will solve the world's pollution problem

But it does show what can be done

if you look at this problem slightly differently

Look at this Tshirt I'm holding right now
T
This is made from the same AIRINK I'm talking about
AIRINK
It's made from the same pollution that is inside this petri dish

And the same pollution we are all breathing in when we are walking outdoors

And we are on our way to do better than this

Thank you very much

Representation matters

Authentic representations of women matter

I think that too often our public representations of women

are enveloped in the language of the extraordinary

The first American woman to become a selfmade millionaire

Madam C J Walker 
cjWalker
The dresses of the first ladies of the United States 

Shirley Chisholm the first woman to seek
Shirley Chisholm
the US Democratic party's presidential nomination 

Applause

As a museum curator

I understand why these stories are so seductive

Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational

But those stories are limiting

By definition being extraordinary is nonrepresentative

It's atypical

Those stories do not create a broad base for incorporating women's history

and they don't reflect our daily realities

If we can collectively apply that radical notion

that women are people

it becomes easier to show women as people are

familiar diverse present

In everyone's everyday throughout history

women exist positively 

not as a matter of interpretation but as a matter of fact

And beyond a more accurate representation of human life

including women considers the quotidian experiences

of the almost  billion people identified as female on this planet

In this now notorious museum scene from the Black Panther movie

a white curator erroneously explains an artifact

to Michael B Jordan's character seen here
B
an artifact from his own culture

This fictional scene caused real debates in our museum communities

about who is shaping the narratives and the bias that those narratives hold

Museums are actually rated

one of the most trustworthy sources of information in the United States

and with hundreds of millions of visitors from all over the world

we should tell accurate histories

but we don't

There is a movement from within museums themselves

to help combat this bias

The simple acknowledgment that museums are not neutral

Museums are didactic

Through the display of art and artifacts

we can incite creativity and foster inclusion

but we are guilty of historical misrepresentation

Our malecentered histories have left our herstories hidden

And there are hard truths about being a woman

especially a woman of color in this industry

that prevents us from centering inclusive examples of women's lives

Museum leadership

predominantly white and male

despite women comprising some  percent of museum staffs

Pipelines to leadership for women are bleak 

bleakest for women of color

And the presence of women does not in and of itself guarantee

an increase in women's public representation

Not all women are gender equity allies

In the words of feminist theorist bell hooks

Patriarchy has no gender

Women can support the system of patriarchy

just as men can support the fight for gender equity

And we often downplay the importance of intersectionality

Marian Anderson was one of the most celebrated voices of the th century

and the Smithsonian collected her  outfit

After the white Daughters of the American Revolution denied her access

to sing in Constitution Hall because she was black

she famously sang instead on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial

to a crowd of over  people

And in libraries all over including museums

you can still find the groundbreaking  anthology entitled

All the Women Are White

All the Blacks Are Men

But Some of Us Are Brave

Demands for the increase of women's representation

does not automatically include AfroLatinas like me 

or immigrant women or Asian women or Native women

or trans women or undocumented women

or women over  or girls 

the list can go on and on and on

So what do we do

Targeted initiatives have helped incorporate perspectives

that should have always been included

I arrived at the Smithsonian through a Latino curatorial initiative

whose hiring of Latinx curators

mostly women by the way

has raised the profile for Latinx narratives across our institution

And it served as a model

for our much larger Smithsonian American Women's History Initiative

which seeks to amplify diverse representations of women

in every possible way

so that women show up

not only in the imagery of our contemporary realities

but in our historical representations

because we've always been here

Right now though in  I can still walk into professional spaces

and be the only 

the only person under  the only black person

the only black woman the only Latina

sometimes the only woman

My mother is AfricanAmerican and my father is AfroPanamanian

I am so proudly and inextricably both

As an AfroLatina I'm one of millions

As an AfroLatina curator I'm one of very few

And bringing my whole self into the professional realm

can feel like an act of bravery

and I'll admit to you that I was not always up for that challenge

whether from fear of rejection or selfpreservation

In meetings I would only speak up

when I had a fully developed comment to share

No audible brainstorming or riffing off of colleagues

For a long time

I denied myself the joy of wearing my beloved hoop earrings

or nameplate necklace to work

thinking that they were too loud or unscholarly or unprofessional

Laughter

I wondered how people would react to my natural hair

or if they viewed me as more acceptable or less authentic when I straightened it

And anyone who has felt outside of mainstream representations

understands that there are basic elements just of our everyday being

that can make other people uncomfortable

But because I am passionate

about the everyday representation of women as we are

I stopped presenting an inauthentic representation of myself or my work

And I have been tested

This is me pointing at my hoop earring in my office 

Laughter

Just last month I was invited to keynote a Latino Heritage Month event

The week of the presentation the organization expressed concerns

They called my slides activist

and they meant that negatively

Laughter

Applause

Two days before the presentation

they requested that I not show a twominute video affirming natural hair

because it may create a barrier to the learning process

for some of the participants

Laughter

That poem Hair was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo

a DominicanAmerican  National Book Award winner

and it appeared in an awardwinning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated

I canceled the talk

explaining to them that their censorship of me and my work made me uncomfortable

Applause and cheers

Respectability politics and idealized femininity

influence how we display women

and which women we choose to display

And that display has skewed toward successful and extraordinary

and reputable and desirable

which maintains the systemic exclusion

and marginalization of the everyday the regular the underrepresented

and usually the nonwhite

As a museum curator I am empowered to change that narrative

I research collect and interpret objects and images of significance

Celia Cruz the queen of Salsa 

Cheers

yes  is significant

And an AfroLatina

The Smithsonian has collected her costumes her shoes

her portrait her postage stamp

and this reimagining 

by artist Tony Peralta

When I collected and displayed this work

it was a victory for symbolic contradictions

Pride in displaying a darkskinned Latina

a black woman

whose hair is in large rollers which straighten your hair

perhaps a nod to white beauty standards

A refined glamorous woman in oversized chunky gold jewelry

When this work was on view

it was one of our most Instagrammed pieces
Instagram
and visitors told me they connected with the everyday elements

of her brown skin or her rollers or her jewelry

Our collections include Celia Cruz

and a rare portrait of a young Harriet Tubman 

iconic clothing from the incomparable Oprah Winfrey

But museums can literally change

how hundreds of millions of people see women

and which women they see

So rather than always the first or the famous

it's also our responsibility to show a regular Saturday at the beauty salon

the art of doorknocker earrings 

Laughter

fashionable sisterhood 

Laughter

and cultural pride at all ages

Stories of everyday women

whose stories have been knowingly omitted from our national and global histories

And oftentimes in museums you see women represented by clothing

or portraits or photography 

but impactful lifechanging stories from everyday women

can also look like this Esmeraldan boat seat

Esmeraldas Ecuador was a maroon community
Esmeraldas
Its dense rainforest protected indigenous and African populations

from Spanish colonizers

There are roads now

but there are some parts inland that are still only accessible by canoe

Dbora Nazareno frequently traveled those Ecuadorian waterways by canoe

so she had her own boat seat

Hers personalized with a spiderweb and a spider

representing Anansi a character in West African folklore

Dbora also sat on this seat at home telling stories to her grandson Juan

And this intangible ritual of love

in the form of intergenerational storytelling

is common in communities across the African diaspora

And this everyday act sparked in Juan the desire to collect and preserve

over  documents related to AfroIndian culture

In  Juan Garca Salazar Dbora's grandson
Juan Garc  a Salazar
and by now a worldrenowned AfroEcuadorian scholar

traveled to Washington DC

He met with Lonnie Bunch the director of the museum where I work

and toward the end of their conversation

Juan reached into his bag and said I'd like to give you a present

On that day Dbora Nazareno's humble wooden boat seat

became the very first object donated

to the Smithsonian National Museum of AfricanAmerican History and Culture

It is encased displayed and has been seen by almost five million visitors

from all over the world

I will continue to collect from extraordinary historymakers

Their stories are important

But what drives me to show up today and every day

is the simple passion to write our names in history

display them publicly for millions to see

and walk in the everpresent light that is woman

Thank you

Applause and cheers

I'm a bit of a perfectionist

Now how many times have you heard that one

Over drinks maybe with friends or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving

It's everyone's favorite flaw

it's that now quite common response

to the difficult final question at job interviews

My biggest weakness

That's my perfectionism

You see for something that supposedly holds us back

it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up

and say we're perfectionists

But there's an interesting and serious point

because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive

that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms

What does it say about us and our society

that there is a kind of celebration in perfection

We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth

The emblem of the successful

Yet in my time studying perfectionism

I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful

Quite the contrary 

they feel discontented and dissatisfied

amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough

We know from clinician case reports

that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties

including things like depression anxiety anorexia bulimia

and even suicide ideation

And what's more worrying is that over the last  years

we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate

And at the same time

we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before

Rates of suicide in the US alone

increased by  percent across the last two decades

And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada

and in my home country the United Kingdom

Now our research is suggesting

that perfectionism is rising as society is changing

And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity

and with it differences in the way in which young people interact

with each other and the world around them

And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent marketbased society

that include things like unrestricted choice

and personal freedom

and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing

to almost epidemic levels of this problem

So let me give you an example

Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life

and lifestyle

In terms of their image status and wealth

Data from Pew show that young people

born in the US in the late s

are  percent more likely to report being materially rich

as among their most important life goals

relative to their parents and their grandparents

Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations

and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods

and status possessions

These possessions their lives and their lifestyles

are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms

of Instagram Facebook Snapchat
InstagramFacebookSnapchat
In this new visual culture

the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality

If one side of the modern landscape

that we have so lavishly furnished for young people

is this idea that there's a perfectible life

and that there's a perfectible lifestyle

then the other is surely work

Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough

Or so we're told

This is the idea at the heart of the American dream

Opportunity meritocracy the selfmade person hard work

The notion that hard work always pays off

And above all the idea that we're captains of our own destiny

These ideas they connect our wealth our status

and our image with our innate personal value

But it is of course complete fiction

Because even if there were equality of opportunity

the idea that we are captains of our own destiny

disguises a much darker reality for young people

that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal

Metrics rankings lead tables

have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified

and used to sort young people into schools classes and colleges

Education is the first arena

where measurement is so publicly played out

and where metrics are being used

as a tool to improve standards and performance

And it starts young

Young people in America's big city high schools

take some  mandatory standardized tests

between prekindergarten and the end of th grade

No wonder young people report a strong need to strive

perform and achieve at the center of modern life

They've been conditioned to define themselves

in the strict and narrow terms of grades percentiles and lead tables

This is a society that preys on their insecurities

Insecurities about how they are performing

and how they are appearing to other people

This is a society that amplifies their imperfections

Every flaw every unforeseen setback

increases a need to perform more perfectly next time or else

bluntly you're a failure

That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive 

just talk to young people

How should I look how should I behave

I should look like that model

I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer
Instagram
I must do better in school

In my role as mentor to many young people

I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand

And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly

John not his real name was ambitious

hardworking and diligent

and on the surface he was exceptionally highachieving

often getting firstclass grades for his work

Yet no matter how well John achieved

he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures

and in meetings with me

he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down

John's justification was quite simple

How could he be a success

when he was trying so much harder than other people

just to attain the same outcomes

See John's perfectionism his unrelenting work ethic

was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness

to himself and to others

Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism

as a way of being in the world

Contrary to popular belief

perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks

It's not about striving for excellence

John's case highlights this vividly

At its root perfectionism is about perfecting the self

Or more precisely perfecting an imperfect self

And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement

that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling

And we think to ourselves Once I've reached that summit

then people will see I'm not flawed and I'll be worth something

But what perfectionism doesn't tell us

is that soon after reaching that summit

we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame

just to try and scale that peak again

This is the cycle of selfdefeat

In the pursuit of unattainable perfection a perfectionist just cannot step off

And it's why it's so difficult to treat

Now we've known for decades and decades

that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems

but there was never a good way to measure it

That was until the late s

when two Canadians Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett

came along and developed a selfreport measure of perfectionism

So that's right folks you can measure this

and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism

The first is selforiented perfectionism

the irrational desire to be perfect

I strive to be as perfect as I can be

The second is socially prescribed perfectionism

the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding

I feel that others are too demanding of me

And the third is otheroriented perfectionism

the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people

If I ask somebody to do something I expect it to be done perfectly

Now research shows that all three elements of perfectionism

associate with compromised mental health

including things like heightened depression

heightened anxiety and suicide ideation

But by far the most problematic element of perfectionism

is socially prescribed perfectionism

That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect

This element of perfectionism

has a large correlation with serious mental illness

And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind

I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing

To date research in this area is focused on immediate family relations

but we wanted to look at it at a broader level

So we took all of the data that had ever been collected

in the  years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure

and we isolated the data in college students

This turned out to be more than  young people

from American Canadian and British colleges

and with so much data available we looked to see if there was a trend

And in all it took us more than three years

to collate all of this information crunch the numbers

and write our report

But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming

All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time

But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase and by far

In 

just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels

of socially prescribed perfectionism

Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations

By  that figure had doubled to  percent

And by  projections based on the models that we tested

indicate that almost one in three young people

will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism

Remember this is the element of perfectionism

that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness

and that's for good reason

Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need

to meet the expectations of other people

And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection

they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree

because these folks believe that the better they do

the better that they're expected to do

This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and worse hopelessness

But is there hope

Of course there's hope

Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things 

they are typically bright ambitious conscientious and hardworking

And yes treatment is complex

But a little bit of selfcompassion

going easy on ourselves when things don't go well

can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success

And then there's what we can do as caregivers

Perfectionism develops in our formative years

and so young people are more vulnerable

Parents can help their children

by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed

And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge

in today's highly competitive society to helicopterparent

as a lot of anxiety is communicated

when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own

But ultimately our research raises important questions

about how we are structuring society

and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition evaluation and testing

is benefiting young people

It's become commonplace for public figures to say

that young people just need a little bit more resilience

in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures

But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue

because we have a shared responsibility

to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection

in the first place

Let's not kid ourselves

Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge

and for a generation of young people

that live their lives in the  spotlight

of metrics lead tables and social media

perfectionism is inevitable

so long as they lack any purpose in life

greater than how they are appearing

or how they are performing to other people

What can they do about it

Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop

they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again

The ancient Greeks knew

that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain

is not the road to happiness

Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus

doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill

only to see it roll back down and have to start again

So long as we teach young people

that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives

than this hopeless quest for perfection

then we are going to condemn future generations

to that same futility and despair

And so we're left with a question

When are we going to appreciate

that there is something fundamentally inhuman

about limitless perfection

No one is flawless

If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism

then we will teach them that in a chaotic world

life will often defeat us but that's OK

Failure is not weakness

If we want to help our young people outgrow this selfdefeating snare

of impossible perfection

then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion

But most of all

if we want our young people to enjoy mental emotional

and psychological health

then we will invite them to celebrate the joys

and the beauties of imperfection

as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving

Thank you very much

Let's play a game

Imagine that you are in Las Vegas

in a casino

and you decide to play a game on one of the casino's computers

just like you might play solitaire or chess

The computer can make moves in the game just like a human player

This is a coin game

It starts with a coin showing heads

and the computer will play first

It can choose to flip the coin or not

but you don't get to see the outcome

Next it's your turn

You can also choose to flip the coin or not

and your move will not be revealed to your opponent the computer

Finally the computer plays again and can flip the coin or not

and after these three rounds

the coin is revealed

and if it is heads the computer wins

if it's tails you win

So it's a pretty simple game

and if everybody plays honestly and the coin is fair

then you have a  percent chance of winning this game

And to confirm that

I asked my students to play this game on our computers

and after many many tries

their winning rate ended up being  percent or close to  percent

as expected

Sounds like a boring game right

But what if you could play this game on a quantum computer

Now Las Vegas casinos do not have quantum computers

as far as I know

but IBM has built a working quantum computer
IBM
Here it is

But what is a quantum computer

Well quantum physics describes

the behavior of atoms and fundamental particles

like electrons and photons

So a quantum computer operates

by controlling the behavior of these particles

but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers

So a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version

of our current computers

just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle

You cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles

A light bulb is a different technology

based on deeper scientific understanding

Similarly a quantum computer is a new kind of device

based on the science of quantum physics

and just like a light bulb transformed society

quantum computers have the potential to impact

so many aspects of our lives

including our security needs our health care and even the internet

So companies all around the world are working to build these devices

and to see what the excitement is all about

let's play our game on a quantum computer

So I can log into IBM's quantum computer from right here
IBM
which means I can play the game remotely

and so can you

To make this happen you may remember getting an email ahead of time from TED
TED
asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not

if you played the game

Well actually we asked you to choose between a circle or a square

You didn't know it but your choice of circle meant flip the coin

and your choice of square was don't flip

We received  responses

Thank you

That means we can play  games against the quantum computer

using your choices

And it's a pretty fast game to play

so I can show you the results right here

Unfortunately you didn't do very well

Laughter

The quantum computer won almost every game

It lost a few only because of operational errors in the computer

Laughter

So how did it achieve this amazing winning streak

It seems like magic or cheating

but actually it's just quantum physics in action

Here's how it works

A regular computer simulates heads or tails of a coin as a bit

a zero or a one

or a current flipping on and off inside your computer chip

A quantum computer is completely different

A quantum bit has a more fluid nonbinary identity

It can exist in a superposition or a combination of zero and one

with some probability of being zero and some probability of being one

In other words its identity is on a spectrum

For example it could have a  percent chance of being zero

and a  percent chance of being one

or  or 

The possibilities are endless

The key idea here

is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one

and allow for some uncertainty

So during the game

the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails

zero and one

so that no matter what the player does

flip or no flip

the superposition remains intact

It's kind of like stirring a mixture of two fluids

Whether or not you stir the fluids remain in a mixture

but in its final move

the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one

perfectly recovering heads so that you lose every time

Laughter

If you think this is all a bit weird you are absolutely right

Regular coins do not exist in combinations of heads and tails

We do not experience this fluid quantum reality

in our everyday lives

So if you are confused by quantum

don't worry you're getting it

Laughter

But even though we don't experience quantum strangeness

we can see its very real effects in action

You've seen the data for yourself

The quantum computer won

because it harnessed superposition and uncertainty

and these quantum properties are powerful

not just to win coin games

but also to build future quantum technologies

So let me give you three examples of potential applications

that could change our lives

First of all quantum uncertainty could be used to create private keys

for encrypting messages sent from one location to another

so that hackers could not secretly copy the key perfectly

because of quantum uncertainty

They would have to break the laws of quantum physics

to hack the key

So this kind of unbreakable encryption is already being tested by banks

and other institutions worldwide

Today we use more than  billion connected devices globally

Just imagine the impact quantum encryption could have in the future

Secondly quantum technologies could also transform health care and medicine

For example the design and analysis of molecules for drug development

is a challenging problem today

and that's because exactly describing and calculating

all of the quantum properties of all the atoms in the molecule

is a computationally difficult task even for our supercomputers

But a quantum computer could do better

because it operates using the same quantum properties

as the molecule it's trying to simulate

So future largescale quantum simulations for drug development

could perhaps lead to treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's

which affects thousands of lives

And thirdly my favorite quantum application

is teleportation of information from one location to another

without physically transmitting the information

Sounds like scifi but it is possible

because these fluid identities of the quantum particles

can get entangled across space and time

in such a way that when you change something about one particle

it can impact the other

and that creates a channel for teleportation

It's already been demonstrated in research labs

and could be part of a future quantum internet

We don't have such a network as yet

but my team is working on these possibilities

by simulating a quantum network on a quantum computer

So we have designed and implemented some interesting new protocols

such as teleportation among different users in the network

and efficient data transmission

and even secure voting

So it's a lot of fun for me being a quantum physicist

I highly recommend it

Laughter

We get to be explorers in a quantum wonderland

Who knows what applications we will discover next

We must tread carefully and responsibly

as we build our quantum future

And for me personally

I don't see quantum physics as a tool just to build quantum computers

I see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature

and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experiences

How amazing that we humans

with our relatively limited access to the universe

can still see far beyond our horizons

just using our imagination and our ingenuity

And the universe rewards us

by showing us how incredibly interesting and surprising it is

The future is fundamentally uncertain

and to me that is certainly exciting

Thank you

Applause

Pat Mitchell I know you don't like that legend business

Marian Wright Edelman I don't

Laughter

PM Why not Marian

Because you are somewhat of a legend

You've been doing this for a long time

and you're still there as founder and president

MWE Well because my daddy raised us and my mother raised us to serve

and we are servantleaders

And it is not about external things or labels

and I feel like the luckiest person in the world

having been born at the intersection of great needs and great injustices

and great opportunities to change them

So I just feel very grateful

that I could serve and make a difference

PM What a beautiful way of saying it
PM
Applause

You grew up in the American South

and like all children

a lot of who you became was molded by your parents

Tell me What did they teach you about movementbuilding

MWE I had extraordinary parents I was so lucky

My mother was the best organizer I ever knew

And she always insisted even back then on having her own dime

She started her dairy so that she could have her penny

and that sense of independence has certainly been passed on to me

My daddy was a minister and they were real partners

And my oldest sibling is a sister

I'm the youngest and there are three boys in between

But I always knew I was as smart as my brothers

I always was a tomboy

I always had the same high aspirations that they had

But most importantly we were terribly blessed

even though we were growing up

in a very segregated small town in South Carolina 

we knew it was wrong

I always knew from the time I was four years old

that I wasn't going to accept being put into slots

But Daddy and Mama always had the sense that it was not us

it was the outside world

but you have the capacity to grow up to change it

and I began to do that very early on

But most importantly they were the best role models

because they said if you see a need

don't ask why somebody doesn't do it

See what you can do

There was no home for the aged in our hometown

And Reverend Reddick who had what we know now  years later as Alzheimer's

and he began to wander the streets

And so Daddy and Mama figured out he needed a place to go

so we started a home for the aged

Children had to cook and clean and serve

We didn't like it at the time

but that's how we learned that it was our obligation

to take care of those who couldn't take care of themselves

I had  foster sisters and brothers

My mother took them in after we left home and she took them in before we left home

And again whenever you see a need you try to fulfill it

God runs Daddy used to say a full employment economy

Laughter

And so if you just follow the need

you will never lack for something to do or a real purpose in life

And every issue that the Children's Defense Fund works on today

comes out of my childhood in a very personal way

Little Johnny Harrington who lived three doors down from me

stepped on a nail he lived with his grandmother
 
got tetanus went to the hospital no tetanus shots he died

He was  years old

I remember that

An accident in front of our highway

turns out to have been two white truck drivers

and a migrant family that happened to be black

We all ran out to help

It was in the front of a church and the ambulance came

saw that the white truck drivers were not injured

saw the black migrant workers were

turned around and left them

I never forgot that

And immunizations was one of the first things

I worked on at the Children's Defense Fund

to make sure that every child gets immunized against preventable diseases

Unequal schools 

Applause

Separate and unequal

handmedowns from the white schools

But we always had books in our house

Daddy was a great reader

He used to make me read every night with him

I'd have to sit for  or  minutes

One day I put a True Confessions inside a Life Magazine

and he asked me to read it out loud

I never read a True Confessions again

Laughter

But they were great readers

We always had books before we had a second pair of shoes

and that was very important

And although we had handmedown books for the black schools

and handmedown everythings

it was a great need

He made it clear that reading was the window to the outside world

and so that was a great gift from them

But the reinforced lesson was that God runs a full employment economy

and that if you just follow the need

you will never lack for a purpose in life

and that has been so for me

We had a very segregated small town

I was a rebel from the time I was four or five

I went out to a department store

and there was white and black water signs

but I didn't know that and didn't pay much attention to that

and I was with one of my Sunday school teachers

I drank out of the wrong water fountain

and she jerked me away and I didn't know what had happened

and then she explained to me about black and white water

I didn't know that and after that

I went home took my little wounded psyche to my parents

and told them what had happened and said What's wrong with me

And they said It wasn't much wrong with you

It's what's wrong with the system

And I used to go then secretly and switch water signs

everywhere I went

Laughter

And it felt so good

Applause

PM There is no question that this legend is a bit of a rebel
PM
and has been for a long time

So you started your work as an attorney and with the Civil Rights Movement

and you worked with Dr King on the original Poor People's Campaign

And then you made this decision  years ago

to set up a national advocacy campaign for children

Why did you choose that particular service to children

MWE Well because so many of the things that I saw in Mississippi

and across the South

had to do with children

I saw children with bloated bellies in this country

who were close to starvation

who were hungry

who were without clothes

and nobody wanted to believe

that there were children who were starving

and that's a slow process

And nobody wanted to listen

Every congressman that would come to Mississippi

I'd say Go see and most of them didn't want to do anything about it

But I saw grinding poverty

The state of Mississippi wanted during voter registration efforts 

and with outside white kids coming in to help black citizens register to vote 

they wanted everybody to leave the state so they were trying to starve them out

And they switched from free food commodities

to food stamps that cost two dollars

People had no income and nobody in America wanted to believe

that there was anybody in America without any income

Well I knew hundreds of them thousands of them

And malnutrition was becoming a big problem

And so one of these days came Dr King down

on a number of things we were fighting to get the Head Start program 
Head Start
which the state of Mississippi turned down 

refinanced

And he went into a center

that the poor community was running without any help

and he saw a teacher carve up an apple for eight or  children

and he had to run out because he was in tears

He couldn't believe it

But only when Robert Kennedy decided he would come 

I had gone to testify about the Head Start program

because they were attacking

And I asked please come and see yourself

and when you come and see

see hungry people and see starving children

And they came and he brought the press

and that began to get the movement going

But they wanted to push all the poor people to go north

and to get away from being voters

And I'm proud of Mike Espy

Even though he lost last night he'll win one of these days

Applause

But you wouldn't have seen such grinding poverty

and the outside white kids who'd come in to help register voters

in the  Summer Project where we lost those three young men

But once they left the press left

and there was just massive need

and people were trying to push the poor out

And so you know Head Start came

and we applied for it because the state turned it down

And that's true of a lot of states that don't take Medicaid these days

And we ran the largest Head Start program in the nation

and it changed their lives

They had books that had children who looked like them in it

and we were attacked all over the place

But the bottom line

was that Mississippi gave birth to the Children's Defense Fund

in many ways

and it also occurred to me that children

and preventive investment

and avoiding costly care

and failure and neglect

was a more strategic way to proceed

And so the Children's Defense Fund

was born out of the Poor People's Campaign

But it was pretty clear that whatever you called

black independent or brown independent

was going to have a shrinking constituency

And who can be mad at a twomonthold baby or at a twoyearold toddler

A lot of people can be

They don't want to feed them neither from what we've seen

But it was the right judgment to make

And so out of the privilege of serving

as the Poor People's Campaign coordinator for policy

for two years and there were two of them

and it was not a failure

because the seeds of change get planted

and have to have people who are scut workers and follow up

And I'm a good scut worker and a persistent person

And you know as a result

I would say that all those people on food stamps today

ought to thank those poor people in the mud in Resurrection City

But it takes a lot of followup detailed work  and never going away

PM And you've been doing it for  years
PM
and you've seen some amazing outcomes

What are you proudest of out of the Children's Defense Fund

MWE Well I think the children now have sort of become a mainstream issue

We have got lots of new laws

Millions of children are getting food

Millions of children are getting a head start

Millions of children are getting Head Start

and have gotten a head start

and the Child Health Insurance Program CHIP
CHIP
Medicaid expansions for children

We've been trying to reform the child welfare system for decades

We finally got a big breakthrough this year

and it says be ready with the proposals when somebody's ready to move

and sometimes it takes five years  years  years but you're there

I've been trying to keep children out of foster care and out of institutions

and with their families with preventive services

That got passed

But there are millions of children who have hope

who have access to early childhood

Now we are not finished

and we are not going to ever feel finished

until we end child poverty in the richest nation on earth

It's just ridiculous that we have to be demanding that

Applause

PM And there are so many of the problems in spite of the successes
PM
and thank you for going through some of them Marian 

the Freedom Schools

the generations of children now

who have gone through Children's Defense Fund programs

But when you look around the world

in this country the United States and in other countries

there are still so many problems

What worries you the most

MWE What worries me is how irresponsible we adults in power have been

in passing on a healthier earth

And it worries me when I read the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists

and see now that we are two minutes from midnight

and that's gotten closer

We have put our future

and our children's future and safety at risk

in a world that is still too much governed by violence

We must end that

We must stop investing in war and start investing in the young and in peace

and we are really so far away from doing that

Applause

And I don't want my grandchildren

to have to fight these battles all over again

and so I get more radical

The older I get the more radical I get

because there are just some things that we as adults have to do

for the next generations

And I looked at the sacrifices of Mrs Hamer

and all those people in Mississippi

who risked their lives to give us a better life

But the United States has got to come to grips

with its failure to invest in its children

and it's the Achilles' heel of this nation

How can you be one of the biggest economies in the world

and you let  million children go live in poverty

and you let children go homeless

when you've got the means to do it

We've got to rethink who we are as a people

be an example for the world

There should be no poverty

In fact we want to say we're going to end poverty in the world

Just start at home

And we've made real progress

but it's such hard work

and it's going to be our Achilles' heel

We should stop giving more tax cuts

sorry folks to billionaires rather than to babies

and their health care

We should get our priorities straight

Applause

That's not right and it's not costeffective

And the key to this country is going to be an educated child population

and yet we've got so many children

who cannot read or write at the most basic levels

We're investing in the wrong things

and I wouldn't be upset about anybody having one billion

 billion [US dollars]
[]
if there were no hungry children

if there were no homeless children

if there were no uneducated children

And so it's really about what does it mean to live

and lead this life

Why were we put on this earth

We were put on this earth to make things better

for the next generations

And here we're worrying about climate change

and global warming

And we're looking at again I constantly cite 

I look at that Bulletin of Atomic Scientists every year

And it says now Two minutes to midnight

Are we out of our minds adults

about passing on a better a world to our children

That's what our purpose is to leave a better world for everybody

and the concept of enough for everybody

There should be no hungry children in this world

with the rich wealth that we have

And so I can't think of a bigger cause

and I think that I'm driven by my faith

And it's been a privilege to serve

but I always had the best role models in the world

Daddy always said God runs a full employment economy

and that if you just follow the need

you'll never lack for a purpose in life

And I watched the partnership  because my mother was a true partner

I always knew I was as smart as my brothers at least

And we always knew that we were not just to be about ourselves

but that we were here to serve

PM Well Marian I want to say on behalf of all the world's children

thank you for your passion

your purpose and your advocacy

Applause

Architecture is a profession with many rules

some written some not

some relevant and others not

As architects we're constantly gravitating

between following these rules by the book

or making a space for imagination 

for experimentation

This is a difficult balance

Especially through architecture

you're trying to challenge preconceptions and push boundaries and innovate

even if just using what we have around and we overlook all the time

And this is what I've been doing along with my team

Ensamble Studio

and from our very early works

that happened in strict historic contexts

like the city of Santiago de Compostela

Here we built the General Society of Authors and Editors

a cultural building

And on top of all the regulations

we had to use stone by code

and our experience was limited

but we had incredible references to learn from

some coming from the city itself

or from nearby landscapes

or other remote places

that had impacted our education as architects

and maybe you recognize here

But somehow the finished products that industry made available

for us as architects to use in our buildings

seemed to have lost their soul

And so we decided to go to the nearby quarries

to better understand the process that transforms a mountain

into a perfectly square tile that you buy from a supplier

And we were taken by the monumental scale of the material

and the actions to extract it

And looking carefully

we noticed hundreds of irregular blocks piling up everywhere

They are the leftovers of an extraction sequence

the ugly parts that nobody wants

But we wanted them

We were inspired

And it was a winwin situation

where we could get this residual material of great quality

doomed to be crushed

at a very low cost

Now we had to convince our clients that this was a good idea

but foremost we had to come up with a design process

to reuse these randomly shaped rocks

and we had not done this before

Today everything would be much easier

because we would go to the quarry

with our smartphones equipped with D scanners

and we would document each rock

turn that into a digital model 

highly engineer the whole process

But more than a decade ago

we had to embrace uncertainty

and put on our boots roll up our sleeves

and move to the quarry for a handson experience

And we also had to become the contractors

because we failed at finding somebody willing to share the risk with us

Now luckily we convinced the quarry team to help us build a few prototypes

to resolve some of the technical details

And we agreed on a few mockups

but we got excited

and one stone led to another

until we succeeded to build

an meterlong by eightmeterhigh structure

that recycled all the amorphous material of the quarry

just supported by gravity 

no mortar and no ties

And once built and tested

moving it to the final site in the city center

to unite it with the rest of the building

was a piece of cake

because by having isolated uncertainty

and managed risk in the controlled environment of the quarry

we were able to complete the whole building in time

and on budget

even if using nonconventional means and methods

And I still get goosebumps

when I see this big chunk of the industrial landscape

in the city

in a building

experienced by the visitors and the neighbors

This building gave us quite a few headaches

and so it could have well been an exception in our work

but instead it started to inform a modus operandi

where every project becomes this opportunity

to test the limits of a discipline we believe has to be urgently reimagined

So what you see here are four homes

that we have designed built and inhabited

Four manifestos where we are using the small scale

to ask ourselves big questions

And we are trying to discover the architectures

that result from unconventional applications of pretty mundane materials

and technologies

like concrete in different forms in the top row

or steel and foam in the bottom row

Take for instance these precast concrete beams

You have probably seen them

building bridges highways water channels 

we found them on one of our visits to a precast concrete factory

And they might not seem especially homey or beautiful

but we decided to use them to build our first house

And this was an incredible moment

because we got to be architects as always

builders once more

and for the first time we could be our own clients

So here we are trying to figure out how we can take these huge catalogue beams

of about  tons each

and stack them progressively around a courtyard space 

the heart of the house

And due to the dimensions and their material quality

these big parts are the structure that carry the loads to the ground

but they are much more than that

They are the swimming pool

they are the walls that divide interior from exterior

they are the windows that frame the views

they are the finishes

they are the very spirit of this house

A house that is for us a laboratory

where we are testing how we can use standard elements in nonstandard ways

And we are observing that the results are intriguing

And we are learning by doing

that prefabrication can be much more than stacking boxes

or that heavy parts can be airy and transparent

And on top of designing and building this house

we get invaluable feedback

sharing it with our family and our friends

because this is our life

and our work in progress

The lessons that we learn here get translated into other projects

and other programs

and other scales as well

and they inspire new work

Here again we are looking at very standard products

galvanized steel studs that can be easily cut and screwed

insulating foams cement boards 

all materials that you can find hidden in partition walls

and that we are exposing

and we are using them to build a very lightweight construction system

that can be built almost by anyone

And we are doing it ourselves with our hands in our shop

and we are architects We're not professional builders

but we want to make sure it's possible

And it's so nice that Antn can move it with his hands

and Javier can put it in a container

and we can ship it

like you would ship your belongings if you were moving abroad 

which is what we did five years ago

We moved our gravity center from Madrid

and the house of the concrete beams to Brookline

And we found the ugly duckling of a very nice neighborhood

a onestory garage and the only thing we could afford

But it was OK because we wanted to transform it into a swan

installing on top our justdelivered kit of parts

once more becoming the scientists and the guinea pigs

So this is a house that uses some of the cheapest

and most normal materials that you can find in the market

that applies the ubiquitous fourbyeight modulation

that governs the construction industry

And yet a different organization of the spaces

and a different assembly of the parts

is able to transform an economically built home

into a luxurious space

And now we're dreaming and we're actively working with developers

with builders

with communities

to try to make this a reality for many more homes

and many more families

And you see the world around us is an infinite source of inspiration

if we are curious enough to see beneath the surface of things

Now I'm going to take you to the other side of the moon

to the sublime landscape of Montana

where a few years ago we joined Cathy and Peter Halstead

to imagine Tippet Rise Art Center on a acre working ranch
Tippet Rise
And when we first visited the site

we realized that all we knew about what an art center is

was absolutely pointless for that client

for that community for that landscape

The kind of whitebox museum type had no fit here

So we decided to explode the center into a constellation of fragments

of spaces spread across the vast territory

that would immerse the visitors into the wilderness of this amazing place

So back in the office we are thinking through making

using the land both as support and as material

learning from its geological processes of sedimentation erosion

fragmentation crystallization 

explosion 

to discover architectures that are born from the land

that are visceral extensions of the landscape

like this bridge that crosses Murphy Canyon

Or this fountain

Like this space topping a hill 

or this theatre that brings to us the space of the mountains

and its sound

And in order to realize this idea

construction cannot be perfectly planned

We need to embrace the drastic weather and the local craft

We need to control just those aspects that are critical

like the structural the thermal

the acoustical properties embedded in the form

But otherwise improvisation is welcome and is provoked

And the moment of construction is still a moment of design

and a moment of celebration

where different hands hearts minds come together to perform a final dance

And the result then cannot be anticipated

It comes as a surprise

And we unwrap architecture like you would unwrap a birthday gift

Architecture isn't uncovered

it's discovered

It's extracted from the guts of the earth to build a shelter

one of the most basic human needs

Architecture art landscape

archaeology geology  all made one

And by using the resources at our disposal in radical ways

by making a space for experimentation

we are able to bring to light architectures that find the beauty latent

in the raw and imperfect things that surround us

that elevate them

and let them speak their own language

Thank you

Translator Akinori Oyama Reviewer Peter van de Ven
Akinori Oyama ReviewPeter van de Ven
When I was about eight years old

I first heard about something called climate change or global warming

Apparently that was something humans had created by our way of living

I was told to turn off the lights to save energy

and to recycle paper to save resources

I remember thinking that it was very strange

that humans who are an animal species among others

could be capable of changing the Earth's climate

Because if we were and if it was really happening

we wouldn't be talking about anything else

As soon as you'd turn on the TV everything would be about that

Headlines radio newspapers

you would never read or hear about anything else

as if there was a world war going on

But no one ever talked about it

If burning fossil fuels was so bad that it threatened our very existence

how could we just continue like before

Why were there no restrictions

Why wasn't it made illegal

To me that did not add up

It was too unreal

So when I was  I became ill

I fell into depression

I stopped talking

and I stopped eating

In two months I lost about  kilos of weight

Later on I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome

OCD and selective mutism

That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary 

now is one of those moments

Applause

For those of us who are on the spectrum

almost everything is black or white

We aren't very good at lying

and we usually don't enjoy participating in this social game

that the rest of you seem so fond of

Laughter

I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones

and the rest of the people are pretty strange

Laughter

especially when it comes to the sustainability crisis

where everyone keeps saying climate change is an existential threat

and the most important issue of all

and yet they just carry on like before

I don't understand that

because if the emissions have to stop

then we must stop the emissions

To me that is black or white

There are no gray areas when it comes to survival

Either we go on as a civilization or we don't

We have to change

Rich countries like Sweden need to start reducing emissions

by at least  percent every year

And that is so that we can stay below a twodegree warming target

Yet as the IPCC have recently demonstrated
IPCC
aiming instead for  degrees Celsius

would significantly reduce the climate impacts

But we can only imagine what that means for reducing emissions

You would think the media and every one of our leaders

would be talking about nothing else

but they never even mention it

Nor does anyone ever mention

the greenhouse gases already locked in the system

Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming

so that when we stop burning fossil fuels

we already have an extra level of warming

perhaps as high as  to  degrees Celsius

Furthermore does hardly anyone speak about the fact

that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction

with up to  species going extinct every single day

that the extinction rate today

is between  and  times higher

than what is seen as normal

Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about the aspect of equity or climate justice

clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement

which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale

That means that rich countries

need to get down to zero emissions within  to  years

with today's emission speed

And that is so that people in poorer countries

can have a chance to heighten their standard of living

by building some of the infrastructure that we have already built

such as roads schools hospitals

clean drinking water electricity and so on

Because how can we expect countries like India or Nigeria

to care about the climate crisis

if we who already have everything don't care even a second about it

or our actual commitments to the Paris Agreement

So why are we not reducing our emissions

Why are they in fact still increasing

Are we knowingly causing a mass extinction

Are we evil

No of course not

People keep doing what they do

because the vast majority doesn't have a clue

about the actual consequences of our everyday life

and they don't know that rapid change is required

We all think we know and we all think everybody knows

but we don't

Because how could we

If there really was a crisis

and if this crisis was caused by our emissions

you would at least see some signs

Not just flooded cities tens of thousands of dead people

and whole nations leveled to piles of torn down buildings

You would see some restrictions

But no

And no one talks about it

There are no emergency meetings no headlines no breaking news

No one is acting as if we were in a crisis

Even most climate scientists or green politicians

keep on flying around the world eating meat and dairy

If I live to be  I will be alive in the year 

When you think about the future today you don't think beyond the year 

By then I will in the best case not even have lived half of my life

What happens next

The year  I will celebrate my th birthday

If I have children or grandchildren maybe they will spend that day with me

Maybe they will ask me about you

the people who were around back in 

Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything

while there still was time to act

What we do or don't do right now will affect my entire life

and the lives of my children and grandchildren

What we do or don't do right now

me and my generation can't undo in the future

So when school started in August of this year

I decided that this was enough

I set myself down on the ground outside the Swedish parliament

I school striked for the climate

Some people say that I should be in school instead

Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist

so that I can solve the climate crisis

But the climate crisis has already been solved

We already have all the facts and solutions

All we have to do is to wake up and change

And why should I be studying for a future that soon will be no more

when no one is doing anything whatsoever to save that future

And what is the point of learning facts in the school system

when the most important facts

given by the finest science of that same school system

clearly means nothing to our politicians and our society

Some people say that Sweden is just a small country

and that it doesn't matter what we do

but I think that if a few children can get headlines all over the world

just by not coming to school for a few weeks

imagine what we could all do together if you wanted to

Applause

Now we're almost at the end of my talk

and this is where people usually start talking about hope

solar panels wind power circular economy and so on

but I'm not going to do that

We've had  years of peptalking and selling positive ideas

And I'm sorry but it doesn't work

Because if it would have

the emissions would have gone down by now

They haven't

And yes we do need hope

of course we do

But the one thing we need more than hope is action

Once we start to act hope is everywhere

So instead of looking for hope

look for action

Then and only then hope will come

Today we use  million barrels of oil every single day

There are no politics to change that

There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground

So we can't save the world by playing by the rules

because the rules have to be changed

Everything needs to change 

and it has to start today

Thank you

Applause

It's am you've been awake for forty hours

when you unlock a puzzle containing this video

of some kind of danceoff between a chicken and a rollerskating beaver

Laughter

The confusion and delight you're experiencing

is a typical moment at the MIT Mystery Hunt

which is basically the Olympics meets Burning Man

for a specific type of nerd

Laughter

Today I'm going to take you inside this strange

intellectually masochistic and incredibly joyful world

But first I have to explain what I mean when I say puzzle

A puzzlehuntstyle puzzle is a data set

It can be a grid of letters a sudoku a video an audio 

it can be anything that contains hidden information

that can eventually resolve into an answer that is a word or a phrase

So to give you an example

this is a puzzle called Master Pieces

It consists of  images of LEGO people looking at piles of LEGOs

And to save us some time I'm going to explain what's going on here

Each of the piles of LEGOs is a deconstructed work of art
LEGO
in the style of a famous artist

So does anybody recognize the artist on the left

They used a lot of red

I heard Rothko yeah

The second one

Audience Mondrian

Alex Rosenthal Yeah well done

And the third one This is the hardest one 
 
Yeah Klimt I heard it

Well done the color is the biggest clue there

So the puzzle has various clues

that tell you what matters here are the artists

not the specific works of art

And what you need to do is then look at what you haven't used yet

which is the number of LEGO people in each painting

And you can count them

and then count into the artists' last names by the same number of letters

So there's three people in front of the Rothko on the left

so you take the third letter which is a T
T
There's only one in front of the Mondrian so you take the first letter M
M
And there's three again in front of Klimt so you take the third letter I

You do that for all  of the original artists

and put them in the order

and you get the answer which is illuminate

Laughter

Puzzles like this are about communicating an idea

But where I'm trying to be as clear as possible for you now

puzzles have to navigate the line between abstraction and clarity

They have to be obtuse enough to make you work for it

but elegant enough so you can get to the aha moment
aha
where everything clicks into place

Puzzle solvers are junkies for this aha moment 

it feels like a brief high and an instant of pristine clarity

And there's also a deeper fulfillment at play here

which is that humans are innate problemsolvers

That's why we love crosswords and escape rooms

and figuring out how to explore the bottom of the ocean

Solving deviously difficult puzzles expands our minds in new directions

and it also helps us come at problems from diverse perspectives

These puzzles come in various puzzle hunts

which come in various shapes and sizes

There's onehour ones designed for novices

hour road rallies

and the puzzle hunt of puzzle hunts the MIT Mystery Hunt

This is an event that takes place once a year

and has around  people descending on MIT's campus

and solving puzzles in teams that range from a single person to over 

My team has  people on it 

that includes a national crossword puzzle tournament champion

a particle physicist a composer

an actual deepsea explorer

and me feeling like Mr Bean goes to Bletchley Park

Laughter

That's actually an apt comparison because one year involved a puzzle

where you had to construct a working Enigma machine

out of pieces of cardboard

Laughter

Each Mystery Hunt has a theme

Past ones have included The Matrix and Alice in Wonderland

It's often pop culture and literarybased themes

And the goal is to find the coin

that's been hidden somewhere on MIT's campus

And in order to get there you have to solve around  puzzles

and do various events and challenges

I had done this for about  years without ever dreaming of winning

until January of 

where  hours into a hunt whose theme is the movie Inception

we haven't slept in days so everything is hilarious 

Laughter

The tables are covered in piles of papers of our notes and completed puzzles

The whiteboards are an unintelligible mess of three days' worth of insights

And we're stuck on two puzzles

If we could crack them we would get into the endgame

and after hours of work in a magical moment

they both fall within  seconds of each other

and soon we're on the final runaround

a series of clues that will lead us to the coin

and we're racing through the halls of MIT

trying not to knock over or terrify tour groups

when we realize we're not alone

there's another team on the runaround as well

and we don't know who's ahead

So we're a mess of anxiety

anticipation exhilaration and sleep deprivation

when we arrive at the Alchemist

a sculpture in which we find 

this coin

Cheers

Yeah

Applause

And in claiming it we win the MIT Mystery Hunt

by a tiny margin of five minutes

What I didn't mention before

is that the prize for winning

is that you get to construct the whole hunt for the following year

Laughter

The punishment for winning

is that you have to construct the whole hunt for the following year

At the beginning of  I had never constructed a puzzle before 

I had solved plenty of puzzles

but constructing and solving are entirely different beasts

But once again

I was lucky to be on a team full of brilliant mentors and collaborators

So from a constructor's point of view

a puzzle is where I have an idea

and instead of telling you what it is

I'm going to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so you can figure it out for yourself

and have the joy and experience of the aha moment
aha
This is another way of looking at the aha moment
aha
And what's incredible to me is that this experience

which is very emotional and kind of almost physical

is something that can be carefully designed

So to show you what I mean

this is a puzzle I coconstructed with my friend Matt Gruskin
Matt Gruskin
It's a text adventure

which is the oldschool adventure game format

where you're exploring going north east south and west

picking up items and using them

And you could get to the end of the game part

but you won't have solved the puzzle

In order to do so you have to recognize a hidden layer of information

and the easiest way of seeing it is by mapping the game out

That looks something like this

Does anybody recognize what this is

Yeah exactly

This text adventure takes place within Settlers of Catan
Catansettler
Who here knows what Settlers is

Nerds

Laughter

If you don't know Settlers is a board game
settler
where you're competing against other people

to collect resources and use them to build structures

And within the text adventure we hid information in various ways

with which you could reconstruct an entire game

You could figure out the roads the cities the towns

the resources the numbers on the tiles even the dice rolls

You put all that information together and you could extract an answer

in a way that's too complicated to explain right now

Laughter

But find me afterwards if you really want to know

Laughter

But what this puzzle emphasized for me

is the value of perspective shifts in inspiring an aha
aha
So in this puzzle

you go from experiencing the world on the ground as a character

to looking down on it from above as if you're playing a board game

and in that shift

you completely reframe all the information you've been given

The hardest part of construction for me is coming up with a great idea for an aha
aha
Fortunately the world is a torrent of ideas and information

I've seen fantastic puzzles constructed out of the waggle dances of bees

and the remarkable coincidence that the  keys of a piano

can be perfectly mapped to the  constellations in the sky

Once you find that out you can't not construct the puzzle

and it's going to be about having the solvers

make that connection in their own minds

Whether you give them stars on a keyboard

or play the celestial music of the cosmos

you're getting them there one way or another

Before long you find yourself staring at a turtle

and asking yourself Is this a puzzle

Laughter

And also staring at a turtle and saying

I never appreciated what multitudes this contains in its shell alone

This might be a familiar experience to you

if you've ever been watching a TED Talk and asked yourself Is this a puzzle
TED
Laughter

I'm not telling

But what I will say

is that puzzles can be found in the most unexpected of places

That brings us back to one of my favorite puzzles of all time

which was constructed by Trip Payne
Trip Payne
And this time I'm going to play it for you with the sound on

so get ready to name that tune

Sloweddown mock clucking

Sloweddown mock clucking

Sloweddown mock clucking

Laughter

Who knows what that is

Yeah You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman

Laughter

So you can identify that and seven other songs and clips

and then look at the videos themselves for clues

where the way that they are filmed and edited together

plus things like the cutaways to the panel of five people

sitting at a table

which is reminiscent of a panel of judges

all of this can suggest reality competition show

And either through internet research

or from just recognizing this you can get to the aha
aha
which is that these clips are shotforshot recreations

of lipsynch battles from RuPaul's Drag Race
RuPaul's Drag Race
Laughter

So why do we do this

Laughter

Applause

You tell me I don't know

So first of all it's really fun

But I think it also improves our lives in various ways

Being able to solve puzzles when I'm confronted with a challenge

has allowed me to explore it from multiple perspectives

before I lock in an approach

Also the process of solving is great training for working with a team

knowing when to listen when to share

and how to recognize and celebrate insight

and being able to construct ahas is a very powerful tool
ahas
Think of how powerful and exciting and convincing an idea is

that comes from your own mind

where you make all the connections yourself

So in January of 

after tens of thousands of hours of work

we finally run our Mystery Hunt

And it's a different sort of satisfaction than the quick high of an aha moment

Instead it's the slow burn of saying something through perplexing abstraction

yet being understood

And when it was all over

in our exhaustion we turned to each other and the world and we said

We're never doing this again It's too much work
 
It's really fun but no more winning

One year later in January of 

we won the MIT Mystery Hunt again

Laughter

So we're currently I don't know how many tens of thousands of hours of work in

and we're two months out from the  Hunt

So thank you for listening I have to go write a puzzle

Laughter

Applause

This is me at five years old

shortly before jumping into this beautifully still pool of water

I soon find out the hard way that this pool is completely empty

because the icecold water is near freezing

and literally takes my breath away

Even though I already know how to swim

I can't get up to the water's surface no matter how hard I try

That's the last thing I remember trying to do before blacking out

Turns out the lifeguard on duty had been chatting with two girls

when I jumped in

and I was soon underwater

so he couldn't actually see or hear me struggle

I was eventually saved by a girl walking near the pool

who happened to look down and see me

The next thing I know I'm getting mouthtomouth

and being rushed to the hospital to determine the extent of my brain loss

If I had been flailing at the water's surface

the lifeguard would have noticed and come to save me

I share this neardeath experience because it illustrates

how dangerous things are when they're just beneath the surface

Today I study implicit gender bias in startups

which I consider to be far more insidious than mere overt bias

for this very same reason

When we see or hear an investor

behaving inappropriately towards an entrepreneur

we're aware of the problem

and at least have a chance to do something about it

But what if there are subtle differences

in the interactions between investors and entrepreneurs

that can affect their outcomes

differences that we're not conscious of

that we can't directly see or hear

Before studying startups at Columbia Business School

I spent five years running and raising money for my own startup

I remember constantly racing around to meet with prospective investors

while trying to manage my actual business

At one point I joked that I had reluctantly pitched

each and every family member friend colleague angel investor

and VC this side of the Mississippi
VC
Well in the process of speaking to all these investors

I noticed something interesting was happening

I was getting asked a very different set of questions than my male cofounder

I got asked just about everything that could go wrong with the venture

to induce investor losses

while my male cofounder was asked about our venture's home run potential

to maximize investor gains

essentially everything that could go right with the venture

He got asked how many new customers we were going to bring on

while I got asked how we were going to hang on to the ones we already had

Well as the CEO of the company I found this to be rather odd

In fact I felt like I was taking crazy pills

But I eventually rationalized it by thinking

maybe this has to do with how I'm presenting myself

or it's something simply unique to my startup

Well years later I made the difficult decision to leave my startup

so I could pursue a lifelong dream of getting my PhD

It was at Columbia that I learned about a social psychological theory

originated by Professor Tory Higgins called regulatory focus
Tory Higginsregulatory focus
which differentiates between two distinct motivational orientations

of promotion and prevention

A promotion focus is concerned with gains

and emphasizes hopes accomplishments and advancement needs

while a prevention focus is concerned with losses

and emphasizes safety responsibility and security needs

Since the bestcase scenario for a prevention focus

is to simply maintain the status quo

this has us treading water just to stay afloat

while a promotion focus instead has us swimming in the right direction

It's just a matter of how far we can advance

Well I had my very own eureka moment when it dawned on me

that this concept of promotion

sounded a lot like the questions posed to my male cofounder

while prevention resembled those questions asked of me

As an entrepreneurship scholar

I started digging into the research on startup financing

and discovered there's an enormous gap

between the amount of funds that male and female founders raise

Although women found  percent of US companies

they only get two percent of the venture funding

I got to thinking

what if this funding gap is not due to any fundamental difference

in the businesses started by men and women

What if women get less funding than men

due to a simple difference in the questions that they get asked

After all when it comes to venture funding

entrepreneurs need to convince investors of their startup's home run potential

It's not enough to merely demonstrate

you're not going to lose your investors' money

So it makes sense that women would be getting less funding than men

if they're engaging

in prevention as opposed to promotionoriented dialogues

Well I got the chance to test this hypothesis

on companies with similar quality and funding needs across all years

at the funding competition known as TechCrunch Disrupt
TechCrunch Disrupt
Startup Battlefield has run in New York City
Battlefield
since its inception in 

TechCrunch is widely regarded as the ideal place for startups to launch
TechCrunch
with participants including startups that have since become household names

like Dropbox Fitbit and Mint
DropboxFitbitMint
presenting to some of the world's most prominent VCs

Well despite the comparability of companies in my sample

maleled startups went on to raise five times as much funding

as the femaleled ones

This made me especially curious to see what's driving this gender disparity

Well it took a while

but I got my hands on all the videos of both the pitches and the Q and A sessions

from TechCrunch and I had them transcribed
TechCrunch
I first analyzed the transcripts

by loading a dictionary of regulatoryfocused terms

into the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software called LIWC
liwc
This LIWC software generated the frequencies
liwc
of promotion and prevention words in the transcribed text

As a second method

I had each of the questions and answers manually coded

by the Tory Higgins Research Lab at Columbia

Regardless of the topic at hand

an intention can be framed in promotion or prevention

Let's take that topic of customers I mentioned briefly earlier

A promotioncoded question sounds like

How many new customers do you plan to acquire this year

while a preventioncoded one sounds like

How do you plan to retain your existing customers

During the same time

I also gathered background information

on the startups and entrepreneurs that can affect their funding outcomes

like the startup's age quality and funding needs

and the entrepreneur's past experience

so I could use these data points as controls in my analysis

Well the very first thing that I found

is that there's no difference in the way entrepreneurs present their companies

In other words both male and female entrepreneurs

use similar degrees of promotion and prevention language

in their actual pitches

So having ruled out this difference on the entrepreneur's side

I then moved on to the investor's side

analyzing the six minutes of QA sessions
Q
that entrepreneurs engaged in with the VCs after pitching

When examining the nearly  questions

and corresponding answers in these exchanges

both of my methods showed significant support

for the fact that male entrepreneurs get asked promotion questions

and female entrepreneurs get asked prevention questions

In fact a whopping  percent of the questions posed

to male entrepreneurs were promotionfocused

while  percent of those posed to female entrepreneurs were preventionfocused

What's especially interesting

is that I expected female VCs

to behave similarly to male VCs

Given its prevalence in the popular media and the venturefunding literature

I expected the birdsofafeather theory of homophily to hold here

meaning that male VCs would favor male entrepreneurs

with promotion questions

and female VCs would do the same for female entrepreneurs

But instead all VCs displayed the same implicit gender bias

manifested in the regulatory focus of the questions they posed

to male versus female candidates

So female VCs asked male entrepreneurs promotion questions

and then turned around and asked female entrepreneurs prevention questions

just like the male VCs did

So given the fact that both male and female VCs

are displaying this implicit gender bias

what effect if any does this have on startup funding outcomes

My research shows it has a significant effect

The regulatory focus of investor questions

not only predicted how well the startups would perform

at the TechCrunch Disrupt competitions
TechCrunch Disruption
but also how much funding the startups went on to raise in the open market

Those startups who were asked predominantly promotion questions

went on to raise seven times as much funding

as those asked prevention questions

But I didn't stop there

I then moved on to analyze entrepreneurs' responses to those questions

and I found that entrepreneurs are apt to respond in kind

to the questions they get

meaning a promotion question begets a promotion response

and a prevention question begets a prevention response

Now this might make intuitive sense to all of us here

but it has some unfortunate consequences in this context of venture funding

So what ends up happening

is that a male entrepreneur gets asked a promotion question

granting him the luxury to reinforce his association

with the favorable domain of gains by responding in kind

while a female entrepreneur gets asked a prevention question

and inadvertently aggravates her association

with the unfavorable domain of losses by doing so

These responses then trigger venture capitalists' subsequent biased questions

and the questions and answers collectively fuel a cycle of bias

that merely perpetuates the gender disparity

Pretty depressing stuff right

Well fortunately there's a silver lining to my findings

Those plucky entrepreneurs who managed to switch focus

by responding to prevention questions with promotion answers

went on to raise  times more funding

than those who responded to prevention questions

with prevention answers

So what this means is that if you're asked a question

about defending your startup's market share

you'd be better served to frame your response

around the size and growth potential of the overall pie

as opposed to how you merely plan to protect your sliver of that pie

So if I get asked this question

I would say

We're playing in such a large and fastgrowing market

that's bound to attract new entrants

We plan to take increasing share in this market

by leveraging our startup's unique assets

I've thus subtly redirected this dialogue into the favorable domain of gains

Now these results are quite compelling among startups that launched at TechCrunch
TechCrunch
but field data can merely tell us that there's a correlational relationship

between regulatory focus and funding

So I sought to see whether this difference in regulatory focus

can actually cause funding outcomes

by running a controlled experiment

on both angel investors and ordinary people

Simulating the TechCrunch Disrupt environment
TechCrunch
I had participants listen to four sixminute audio files

of  questionandanswer exchanges

that were manipulated for promotion and prevention language

and then asked them to allocate a sum of funding

to each venture as they saw fit

Well my experimental results reinforced my findings from the field

Those scenarios where entrepreneurs were asked promotion questions

received twice the funding allocations

of those where entrepreneurs were asked prevention questions

What's especially promising

is the fact that those scenarios where entrepreneurs switched

as opposed to matched focus when they received prevention questions

received significantly more funding from both sets of participants

So to my female entrepreneurs out there

here are a couple simple things you could do

The first is to recognize the question you're being asked

Are you getting a prevention question

If this is the case answer the question at hand by all means

but merely frame your response in promotion

in an effort to garner higher amounts of funding for your startups

The unfortunate reality though

is that both men and women evaluating startups

display the same implicit gender bias in their questioning

inadvertently favoring male entrepreneurs over female ones

So to my investors out there

I would offer that you have an opportunity here

to approach QA sessions more evenhandedly
Q
not just so that you could do the right thing

but so that you can improve the quality of your decision making

By flashing the same light on every startup's potential

for gains and losses

you enable all deserving startups to shine

and you maximize returns in the process

Today I get to be that girl

walking by the pool

sounding the alarm

that something is going on beneath the surface

Together we have the power to break this cycle

of implicit gender bias in startup funding

Let's give the most promising startups

regardless of whether they're led by men or women

a fighting chance to grow and thrive

Thank you

Applause

Now people have a lot of misconceptions about science 

about how it works and what it is

A big one is that science is just a big old pile of facts

But that's not true  that's not even the goal of science

Science is a process

It's a way of thinking

Gathering facts is just a piece of it but it's not the goal

The ultimate goal of science is to understand objective reality

the best way we know how

and that's based on evidence

The problem here is that people are flawed

We can be fooled 

we're really good at fooling ourselves

And so baked into this process is a way of minimizing our own bias

So sort of boiled down more than is probably useful

here's how this works

If you want to do some science

what you want to do is you want to observe something 

say The sky is blue Hey I wonder why

You question it

The next thing you do is you come up with an idea that may explain it

a hypothesis

Well you know what Oceans are blue
 
Maybe the sky is reflecting the colors from the ocean

Great but now you have to test it

so you predict what that might mean

Your prediction would be

Well if the sky is reflecting the ocean color

it will be bluer on the coasts

than it will be in the middle of the country

OK that's fair enough

but you've got to test that prediction

so you get on a plane you leave Denver on a nice gray day

you fly to LA you look up and the sky is gloriously blue

Hooray your thesis is proven

But is it really No
 
You've made one observation

You need to think about your hypothesis think about how to test it

and do more than just one

Maybe you could go to a different part of the country

or a different part of the year

and see what the weather's like then

Another good idea is to talk to other people

They have different ideas different perspectives

and they can help you

This is what we call peer review

And in fact that will probably also save you a lot of money and a lot of time

flying coasttocoast just to check the weather

Now what happens if your hypothesis does a decent job but not a perfect job

Well that's OK

because what you can do is you can modify it a little bit

and then go through this whole process again 

make predictions test them 

and as you do that over and over again you will hone this idea

And if it gets good enough

it may be accepted by the scientific community

at least provisionally

as a good explanation of what's going on

at least until a better idea

or some contradictory evidence comes along

Now part of this process is admitting when you're wrong

And that can be really really hard

Science has its strengths and weaknesses

and they depend on this

One of the strengths of science is that it's done by people

and it's proven itself to do a really good job

We understand the universe pretty well because of science

One of science's weaknesses is that it's done by people

and we bring a lot of baggage along with us when we investigate things

We are egotistical

we are stubborn we're superstitious

we're tribal we're humans 

these are all human traits and scientists are humans

And so we have to be aware of that when we're studying science

and when we're trying to develop our theses

But part of this whole thing

part of this scientific process

part of the scientific method

is admitting when you're wrong

I know I've been there

Many years ago I was working on Hubble Space Telescope

and a scientist I worked with came to me with some data

and he said I think there may be a picture

of a planet orbiting another star in this data

We had not had any pictures taken of planets orbiting other stars yet

so if this were true

then this would be the first one

and we would be the ones who found it

That's a big deal

I was very excited

so I just dug right into this data

I spent a long time trying to figure out if this thing were a planet or not

The problem is planets are faint and stars are bright

so trying to get the signal out of this data

was like trying to hear a whisper in a heavy metal concert 

it was really hard

I tried everything I could

but after a month of working on this

I came to a realization  couldn't do it

I had to give up

And I had to tell this other scientist

The data's too messy

We can't say whether this is a planet or not

And that was hard

Then later on we got followup observations with Hubble

and it showed that it wasn't a planet

It was a background star or galaxy something like that

Well not to get too technical but that sucked

Laughter

I was really unhappy about this

But that's part of it

You have to say Look you know we can't do this with the data we have

And then I had to face up to the fact

that even the followup data showed we were wrong

Emotionally I was pretty unhappy

But if a scientist is doing their job correctly

being wrong is not so bad

because that means there's still more stuff out there 

more things to figure out

Scientists don't love being wrong but we love puzzles

and the universe is the biggest puzzle of them all

Now having said that

if you have a piece and it doesn't fit no matter how you move it

jamming it in harder isn't going to help

There's going to be a time when you have to let go of your idea

if you want to understand the bigger picture

The price of doing science is admitting when you're wrong

but the payoff is the best there is

knowledge and understanding

And I can give you a thousand examples of this in science

but there's one I really like

It has to do with astronomy

and it was a question that had been plaguing astronomers

literally for centuries

When you look at the Sun it seems special

It is the brightest object in the sky

but having studied astronomy physics chemistry thermodynamics for centuries

we learned something very important about it

It's not that special

It's a star just like millions of other stars

But that raises an interesting question

If the Sun is a star

and the Sun has planets

do these other stars have planets

Well like I said with my own failure in the planet I was looking for

finding them is super hard

but scientists tend to be pretty clever people

and they used a lot of different techniques

and started observing stars

And over the decades

they started finding some things that were pretty interesting

right on the thin hairy edge of what they were able to detect

But time and again it was shown to be wrong

That all changed in 

A couple of astronomers 

Alexander Lyne  Andrew Lyne pardon me 

and Matthew Bailes

had a huge announcement

They had found a planet orbiting another star

And not just any star but a pulsar

and this is the remnant of a star that has previously exploded

It's blasting out radiation

This is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet

but they had very methodically looked at this pulsar

and they detected the gravitational tug of this planet as it orbited the pulsar

It looked really good

The first planet orbiting another star had been found 

except not so much

Laughter

After they made the announcement

a bunch of other astronomers commented on it

and so they went back and looked at their data

and realized they had made a very embarrassing mistake

They had not accounted for some very subtle characteristics

of the Earth's motion around the Sun

which affected how they measured this planet going around the pulsar

And it turns out that when they did account for it correctly

poof  their planet disappeared

It wasn't real

So Andrew Lyne had a very formidable task

He had to admit this

So in  at the American Astronomical Society meeting

which is one of the largest gatherings of astronomers on the planet

he stood up and announced that he had made a mistake

and that the planet did not exist

And what happened next 

oh I love this 

what happened next was wonderful

He got an ovation

The astronomers weren't angry at him

they didn't want to chastise him

They praised him for his honesty and his integrity

I love that

Scientists are people

Laughter

And it gets better

Laughter

Lyne steps off the podium

The next guy to come up is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan
Aleksander Wolszczan
He takes the microphone and says

Yeah so Lyne's team didn't find a pulsar planet

but my team found not just one

but two planets orbiting a different pulsar

We knew about the problem that Lyne had

we checked for it and yeah ours are real

And it turns out he was right

And in fact a few months later

they found a third planet orbiting this pulsar

and it was the first exoplanet system ever found 

what we call alien worlds  exoplanets

That to me is just wonderful

At that point the floodgates were opened

In  a planet was found around a star more like the Sun

and then we found another and another

This is an image of an actual planet orbiting an actual star

We kept getting better at it

We started finding them by the bucketload

We started finding thousands of them

We built observatories specifically designed to look for them

And now we know of thousands of them

We even know of planetary systems

That is actual data animated showing four planets orbiting another star

This is incredible Think about that

For all of human history

you could count all the known planets in the universe on two hands 

nine  eight

Nine Eight  eight
 
Laughter

Eh

Laughter

But now we know they're everywhere

Every star 

for every star you see in the sky there could be three five ten planets

The sky is filled with them

We think that planets may outnumber stars in the galaxy

This is a profound statement

and it was made because of science

And it wasn't made just because of science and the observatories and the data

it was made because of the scientists who built the observatories

who took the data

who made the mistakes and admitted them

and then let other scientists build on their mistakes

so that they could do what they do

and figure out where our place is in the universe

That is how you find the truth

Science is at its best when it dares to be human

Thank you

Applause and cheers

I want to talk to you tonight

about the work that makes all other work possible

about the millions of women who go to work in our homes

every single day

caring for children as nannies

caring for our loved ones with disabilities and our elders

as home care workers

maintaining sanity in our homes as cleaners

It's the work that makes all other work possible

And it's mostly done by women more than  percent women

disproportionately women of color

And the work itself is associated with work that women have historically done

work that's been made incredibly invisible

and taken for granted in our culture

But it's so fundamental to everything else in our world

It makes it possible for all of us to go out and do what we do in the world

every single day

knowing that the most precious aspects of our lives are in good hands

But we don't think about it that way

It's almost defined by its invisibility

You could go into any neighborhood

and not know which homes are also workplaces

There's no sign

There's no list or registry

It's just invisible

And it's this work that is not even referred to as real work

It's referred to as help

It's often seen as unskilled

not seen as professional

And race has played a profound role in how we value this work in our culture

Some of the first domestic workers in the United States were black women

who were enslaved

and racial exclusion has shaped their conditions for generations

In the s when Congress was discussing the labor laws

that would be a part of the New Deal

that would protect all workers

Southern members of Congress refused to support those labor laws

if they included protections for domestic workers and farmworkers

That history of racial exclusion

and our cultural devaluing of work that's associated with women

now means that millions of women go to work every single day

work incredibly hard

and still can't make ends meet

They earn poverty wages without a safety net

so that the women that we're counting on to take care of us and our families

can't take care of their own doing this work

But my work over the last  years has been about changing precisely that

It's about making these jobs good jobs that you can take pride in

and support your family on

At the National Domestic Workers Alliance we've been working hard in states

to pass new laws that will protect domestic workers from discrimination

and sexual harassment

that will create days of rest paid time off even

So far eight states have passed domestic workers bills of rights

Yes

Applause

And during the Obama administration

we were successful in bringing two million home care workers

under minimum wage and overtime protections

for the first time since 

Applause

Most recently we've been really excited to launch a new portable benefits platform

for domestic workers called Alia

which allows for domestic workers with multiple clients

to give them access to benefits for the very first time

So really important progress is being made

But I would argue tonight

that one of the most important things that domestic workers can provide

is actually what they can teach us

about humanity itself

and about what it will take to create a more humane world for our children

In the face of extreme immorality

domestic workers can be our moral compass

And it makes sense

because what they do is so fundamental

to the very basics of human need and humanity

They are there when we are born into this world

they shape who we become in this world

and they are with us as we prepare to leave this world

And their experiences with families are so varied

They have some relationships with the families that they work for

that are incredibly positive and mutually supportive

and last for years and years

And then the opposite also happens

And we've seen cases of sexual violence and assault

of extreme forms of abuse and exploitation

We've seen cases of human trafficking

Domestic workers live in poor neighborhoods

and then they go to work in very wealthy ones

They cross cultures and generations and borders and boundaries

and their job no matter what

is to show up and care 

to nurture to feed to clothe to bathe

to listen to encourage

to ensure safety

to support dignity 

to care no matter what

I want to tell you a story of a woman I met early on in this work

Her name is Lily

Lily and her family lived in Jamaica

and when she was  years old she was approached by an American couple

who were looking for a livein nanny to come live with them

in the United States

and help them care for their children

They offered Lily's family that if she came to work as their nanny

she would be able to have access to a US education

and she would have a weekly salary sent home to help her family financially

They decided it was a good idea

and decided to take the opportunity

Lily held up her end of the bargain

and helped to raise three children

But all communication with her family was severed

no letters no phone calls

She was never allowed to go to school

and she was never paid 

for  years

One day she saw an article in a newspaper about another domestic worker

with a really similar story to hers

another case that I was working on at the time

and she found a way to reach me

She also found a way to reach her brother

who was living in the United States at the time as well

Between the two of us we were able to help her escape

And she had the help of one of the children

One of the children was old enough to realize

that the way his nanny was being treated was wrong

and he gave her the money that he had been saving through his childhood

to help her escape

But here's the thing about this story

She was essentially enslaved for  years

Human trafficking and slavery is a criminal offense

And so her lawyers and I asked Lily

did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her

And after thinking about what it would mean

she said no

because she didn't want the children to be separated from their parents

Instead we filed a civil lawsuit and we eventually won the case

and her case became a rallying cry for domestic workers everywhere

She was reunited with her family and went on to have a family of her own

But the thing that's so profound to me about this story

is despite having  years stolen from her life

it did not affect the care and compassion that she felt for the children

And I see this from domestic workers all the time

In the face of indignities

and our failure to respect and value this work in our culture

they still show up

and they care

They're simply too proximate to our shared humanity

They know how your toddler likes to be held

as they take their bottle before a nap

They know how your mother likes her tea

how to make her smile and tell stories despite her dementia

They are so proximate to our humanity

They know that at the end of the day

these are people who are part of families 

someone's mother

someone's grandmother

someone's best friend

and someone's baby

undeniably human

and therefore not disposable

Domestic workers know that any time a single person becomes disposable

it's a slippery slope

You see the cultural devaluing of domestic work

is a reflection of a hierarchy of human value

that defines everything in our world

a hierarchy that values the lives and contributions

of some groups of people over others

based on race gender

class immigration status 

any number of categories

And that hierarchy of human value requires stories about those groups of people

in order to sustain itself

So these stories have seeped deep into our culture

about how some people are less intelligent

some people are less intuitive

weaker

by extension less trustworthy

less valuable

and ultimately

less human

And domestic workers know it's a slippery slope

when we start to see a worker as less than a real worker

to a woman as less than a woman

to a mother as less than a mother

to a child as less than a child

In the spring of 

the Trump administration announced a new policy at the USMexico border

a zerotolerance policy

to forcibly separate all children from their parents

who were arriving at the border seeking asylum

children as young as  months separated from their parents

after a long and arduous journey to reach the USMexico border

in search of safety and a new beginning

Thousands of children separated

And because they were migrants

they were treated as less than children

In response I helped to organize the Families Belong Together Vigil
at the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen Texas
on Father's Day
Inside that processing center there were hundreds of children
who were being held processed
and then prepared to be shipped all over country
to be jailed in facilities hundreds of miles away from their parents
I saw with my own eyes
children not [old] enough for kindergarten
in unmarked buses
being shipped off to jails hundreds of miles away
And as they passed us by
they reached for us through the windows
as we stood vigil to let them know that they are not alone

and we are fighting for them

Domestic workers came from all over Texas to be a part of the vigil

They saw in those families their own family stories

They had also come here in search of safety and a new beginning

a better life for their families

and they saw in the eyes of those children

their own children

And through our tears

we looked at each other and we asked each other

How did we get here

to putting children in cages

and separating them from the people who love them the most in the world

How

And what I thought to myself was if domestic workers were in charge

this never would have happened

Our humanity would never have been so disposable

that we would be treating children in this way

The Dalai Lama once said that love and compassion are necessities

not luxuries

Without them humanity cannot survive

In other words they are fundamental to human existence

Domestic workers are in charge of the fundamentals

They love and they care

and they show compassion no matter what

We live in a time of moral choices

everywhere we turn

at the border

at the ballot box

in our workplaces

right in our homes full of moral choices

As you go about your day and you encounter these moral choices

think of Lily

Think like Lily

Think like a domestic worker who shows up and cares no matter what

Love and compassion no matter what

Show up like a domestic worker

because our children are counting on us

Thank you

Applause

We survey CEOs police officers truck drivers cooks engineers

If people are working we've surveyed them

And what we know in terms of their happiness

workers all want the same things

[The Way We Work]
[]
There's three billion working people in the world

And about  percent of them would say they're happy at work

That means about  billion or almost two billion people

are not happy at work

What does that do

both to those people and the organizations that they work in

Well let's talk about money

Organizations that have a lot of happy employees

have three times the revenue growth

compared to organizations where that's not true

They outperform the stock market by a factor of three

And if you look at employee turnover

it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees

The miracle thing is

you don't have to spend more money to make this happen

It's not about pingpong tables and massages and pet walking

It's not about the perks

It's all about how they're treated by their leaders

and by the people that they work with

So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees

Idea number one

in organizations where employees are happy

what you find is two things are present

trust and respect

Leaders often say

We trust our employees

We empower our employees

And then when an employee needs a laptop 

and this is a true example 

 people have to approve that laptop

So for the employee all the words are right

but  levels of approval for a  laptop

You've actually spent more money than the laptop on the approval

And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted

So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust

The first organization that comes to mind is Four Seasons

They have magnificent properties all around the world

And their employees are told

Do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer

To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right

makes the employees feel great

And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service

in the world

Idea number two fairness

The thing that erodes trust in an organization

faster than anything else

is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly

Employees want to be treated the same

regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age

or their experience or their job category

compared to anyone else

When I think about great organizations who get fairness right

the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce
Salesforce
They found that men and women working in the same job

with the same level of proficiency

were making different amounts of money

So immediately they calculated the difference

and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out

Idea number three is listening

So to be a listener who connects with all types of people

we have to unlearn a few things

We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact 

an intense stare

and a compassionate look

That's not listening

Repeating what the person says  that's not listening

Being humble

and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible 

that's what listening is

And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not

They want to know when they talk to you and share an idea

did you consider it when you made a decision

The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking

is to know that what they say matters so much

you might actually change your mind

Otherwise what's the point of the conversation

We all know the things we need to change

the things that we need to do differently

The way you behave the way you treat others

the way you respond the way you support

defines the work experience for everyone around you

Changing to be a better person 

the world is littered with those failures

But changing because there's something you believe in

some purpose that you have

where you're willing to risk almost everything

because it's so important to you 

that's the reason to change

If it's not you should probably find a different place to work

So a little while ago

members of my family had three bits of minor surgery

about a half hour each

and we got three sets of bills

For the first one the anesthesia bill alone was  dollars

the second one  dollars

the third one  dollars

So I'm a journalist I'm like what's up with that

I found out that I was actually for the expensive one

being charged  dollars for a generic antinausea drug

that I could buy online for two dollars and fortynine cents

I had a long and unsatisfactory argument with the hospital

the insurer and my employer

Everybody agreed that this was totally fine

But it got me thinking and the more I talked to people the more I realized

nobody has any idea what stuff costs in health care

Not before during or after that procedure or test

do you have any idea what it's going to cost

It's only months later that you get an explanation of benefits

that explains exactly nothing

So this came back to me a little while later

I had volunteered for a buyout from the New York Times

where I had worked for more than  years as a journalist

I was looking for my next act

It turned out that next act was to build a company

telling people what stuff costs in health care

I won a Shark Tanktype pitch contest to do just that

Health costs ate up almost  percent of our gross domestic product last year

but nobody has any idea what stuff costs

But what if we did know

So we started out small

We called doctors and hospitals

and asked them what they would accept as a cash payment for simple procedures

Some people were helpful

A lot of people hung up on us

Some people were just plain rude

They said We don't know

or Our lawyers won't let us tell you that

though we did get a lot of information

We found for example that here in the New York area

you could get an echocardiogram for  dollars in Brooklyn

or for  dollars in Manhattan just a few miles away

New Orleans the same simple blood test

 dollars over here

 dollars just a few blocks away

San Francisco the same MRI

 dollars

or  dollars just  miles away

These pricing variations existed for all the procedures

and all the cities that we surveyed

Then we started to ask people to tell us their health bills

In partnership with public radio station WNYC here in New York
WNYC
we asked women to tell us the prices of their mammograms
X
People told us nobody would do that that it was too personal

But in the space of three weeks

 women told us about their prices

Then we started to make it easier for people to share their data

into our online searchable database

It's sort of like a mashup of Kayakcom and the Waze traffic app for health care
KayakcomWaze
Laughter

We call it a communitycreated guide to health costs

Our survey and crowdsourcing work grew into partnerships

with top newsrooms nationwide 

in New Orleans Philadelphia

San Francisco Los Angeles Miami and other places

We used the data to tell stories about people who were suffering

and how to avoid that suffering to avoid that gotcha bill

A woman in New Orleans saved nearly  dollars using our data

A San Francisco contributor saved nearly  dollars

by putting away his insurance card

and paying cash

There are a lot of people who are going to innetwork hospitals

and getting outofnetwork bills

And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man

We learned that thousands of people wanted to tell us their prices

They want to learn what stuff costs

find out how to argue a bill

help us solve this problem that's hurting them and their friends and families

We talked to people who had to sell a car to pay a health bill

go into bankruptcy

skip a treatment because of the cost

Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis

but not the cure

We set off a huge conversation about costs

involving doctors and hospitals yes but also their patients

or as we like to call them people

Laughter

We changed policy

A consumer protection bill that had been stalled

in the Louisiana legislature for  years

passed after we launched

Let's face it

this huge slowrolling public health crisis

is a national emergency

And I don't think government's going to help us out anytime soon

But what if the answer was really simple

make all the prices public all the time

Would our individual bills go down Our health premiums
 
Be really clear about this

this is a United States problem

In most of the rest of the developed world

sick people don't have to worry about money

It's also true that price transparency will not solve every problem

There will still be expensive treatments

huge friction from our insurance system

There will still be fraud

and a massive problem with overtreatment and overdiagnosis

And not everything is shoppable

Not everybody wants the cheapest appendectomy

or the cheapest cancer care

But when we talk about these clear effects

we're looking at a real issue that's actually very simple

When we first started calling for prices

we actually felt like we were going to be arrested

It seemed kind of transgressive to talk about medicine and health care

in the same breath

and yet it became liberating

because we found not only data

but also good and honest people out there in the system

who want to help folks get the care they need

at a price they can afford

And it got easier to ask

So I'll leave you with some questions

What if we all knew what stuff cost in health care in advance

What if every time you Googled for an MRI

you got dropdowns telling you where to buy and for how much

the way you do when you Google for a laser printer

What if all of the time and energy and money that's spent hiding prices

was squeezed out of the system

What if each one of us could pick the  test every time

instead of the  one

Would our individual bills go down

Our premiums

I don't know but if you don't ask you'll never know

And you might save a ton of money

And I've got to think that a lot of us and the system itself

would be a lot healthier

Thank you

Hiroko Kawano ReviewTanya Cushman
So I'd like you to join me on a field trip

and I want to go to the beach and take you all to the beach

and so enjoy the sea air and the salt spray

And let's go down to the water's edge

and you'll notice we're getting knocked around by the waves

and it's really difficult to stay in place right

But now look down

and what you're going to see

is that the rocks are covered by all sorts of sea creatures

that are just staying there in place no problem

It turns out that if you want to survive in this really demanding environment

your very existence is dependent upon your ability to make glue actually

So let me introduce you to some of the heroes of our story

just a few of them

So these are mussels

and you'll notice they're covering the rocks

and what they've done is made adhesives

and they're sticking down on the rocks

and they're sticking to each other actually

So they're hunkered down together as a group

This is a closeup photograph of an oyster reef

and oysters they're amazing

What they do is they cement to each other

and they build these huge extensive reef systems

They can be kilometers long they can be meters deep

and arguably they are the most dominant influence

on how healthy any coastal marine ecosystem is going to be

because what they do is they're filtering the water constantly

they're holding sand and dirt in place

Actually other species live inside of these reefs

And then if you think about what happens when a storm comes in

if the storm surge first has to hit miles of these reefs

the coast behind it is going to be protected

So they're really quite influential

If you've been to any rocky beach pretty much anywhere in the world

you're probably familiar with what barnacles look like

And so what these animals do 

and there's many others these are just three of them 

is they make adhesives

they stick to each other and to the rocks and they build communities

and by doing this there's a lot of survival advantages they get

So one of them is that just any individual is subjected to less of the turbulence

and all the damaging features that can happen from that environment

So they're all hunkered down there

Then also there's a safety in numbers thing

because it also helps you keep away the predators

because if say a seagull wants to pick you up and eat you

it's more difficult for the seagull if they're stuck together

And then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency

So you can imagine that when Mr and Mrs Barnacle decide

OK it's time to have little baby barnacles 

I won't tell you how they do that just yet 

but when they decide it's time to do that

it's a lot easier

and their reproductive efficiency's higher if they're all living close together

So we want to understand how they do this

How do they stick

And I can't really tell you all the details

because we're still trying to figure it out

but let me give you a little flavor

of some of the things that we're trying to do

This is a picture of one of the aquarium systems we have in our lab

and everything in the image is part of the system

and so what we do is we keep 

and you can see in the glass tank there at the bottom a bunch of mussels

We have the water chilled we have the lights cycled

we actually have turbulence in the system

because the animals make more adhesives for us

when the water is turbulent

So we induce them to make the adhesive

we collect it we study it

They're here in Indiana

as far as they know they're in Maine in February

and they seem to be pretty happy as far as we can tell

And then we also work with oysters

and up top it's a photo of a small reef in South Carolina

and what we're most interested in is how they attach to each other

how they connect

So what you can see in the bottom image is two oysters cementing to each other

We want to know what's in between

and so a lot of times we'll cut them and look down

and in the next series of images we have here

you can see on the bottom we'll have two shells

the shell of one animal and the shell of another animal

and the cement's in between

If you look at the image on the right

what you can maybe see

is that there's structure in the shell of each animal

but then the cement actually looks different

And so we're using all sorts of fancy biology and chemistry tools

to understand what's going on in there

and what we're finding is the structures are different

and the chemistry is actually different and it's quite interesting

And in this picture 

I guess let me step back before I tell you what this is

So do you know the cartoon The Magic School Bus

Or if you're a little bit older Fantastic Voyage right

And you remember they had characters

that they would shrink down to these microscopic levels

and then they would sort of swirl in

and swim around and fly around all these biological structures

I think of this as like that except for it's real in this case

And so what we did is we have two oysters that are stuck together

and this area used to be completely filled in with the cement

and what we're finding is that the cement has lots of different components in there

but broadly speaking there are hard nonsticky parts

and there are soft sticky parts

and what we did is we removed the nonsticky parts selectively

to see what's left 

for what's actually attaching the animals 

and what we got is this

and we can see there's a sticky adhesive that's holding them together

And I just think it's a really cool image

because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there

Anyways those are some of the things we're doing to understand

how marine biology is making these materials

And from a fundamental perspective it's really exciting to learn

But what do we want to do with this information

Well there's a lot of technological applications

if we can harness what the animals are doing

So let me give you one example

So imagine you're at home

and you break your favorite figurine or a mug or something like that

You want to put it back together

So where do you go

You go to my favorite place in town

which is the glue aisle of the hardware store

I know where you spend your nights

because you're all hip cool people because you're here

and you're going to bars and concerts 

this is where I hang out every night

So anyways

so what I want you to do is get one of every adhesive that's on the shelf

bring it home

but before you try to put things back together

I want you to try to do it in a bucket of water

It's won't work right We all know this
 
So obviously marine biology has solved this

so what we need to do is figure out ways to be able to copy this ourselves

And one of the issues here

is you can't just go and get the materials from the beach

because if you get some mussels and try to milk them for their adhesive

you'll get a little bit of material

but you're never going to have enough to do anything with just enough to see

We need to scale this up ideally maybe traincar scale

So on the top is an image of one of the types of molecules

that the animals use to make their glue

and what they are is very long molecules called proteins

and these proteins happen to have some fairly unique parts in them

that bring about the adhesive properties

What we want to do is take those little parts of that chemistry

and we want to put it into other long molecules that we can get

but that we can make on a really large scale

so you might know them as plastics or polymers

and so we're sort of simplifying what they do

but then putting that adhesion chemistry into these large molecules

And we've developed many different adhesive systems in doing this

When you make a new adhesive that looks pretty good what do you do

You start running around the lab just sticking stuff together

In this case we took a bit of a glue and glued together two pieces of metal

We hung something from it to see what it looked like

so we used a pot of live mussels and we thought we were very clever

Laughs

We're obviously much more quantitative about this most often

and so we benchmark against commercial adhesives

and we actually have some materials now that are stronger than superglue

So to me that's really cool

That's a good day in the lab it's stronger than superglue

And here's something else that we can do

So this is a tank of seawater

and then in that syringe is one of our adhesive formulations

What we're doing is we're dispensing it completely underwater

on a piece of metal

And then we want to make an adhesive bond or joint

So we take another piece of metal

and we put it on there and just position it

And you want to let it set up for a while give it a chance

so we'll just put a weight on it nothing fancy

This is a tube with lead shot in it nothing fancy

And then you let it sit for a while

So this has never seen air it's completely underwater
 
And you pick it up

I never know what's going to happen I'm always very anxious here
 
You pick it up 

and it stuck

To me this is really cool

So we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion

Possibly it's the strongest or one of the strongest underwater adhesives

that's ever been seen

It's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce

so for us it's pretty exciting it's pretty cool

So what do we want to do with these things

Well here are some products that you're probably really familiar with

So think about your cell phone your laptop plywood in most structures

the interior of your car shoes phone books  things like this

They're all held together with adhesives

and there's two main problems

with the adhesives used in these materials

The first one is that they're toxic

So the worst offender here is plywood

Plywood or a lot of furniture or wood laminate in floors 

a main component of the adhesives here is formaldehyde

and it's maybe a compound you've heard of

It's a gas and it's also a carcinogen

and so we're constructing a lot of structures from these adhesives

and we're also breathing a lot of this carcinogen

So not good obviously right

The other issue is that these adhesives are all permanent

And so what do you do with your shoes or your car or even your laptop

at the end of life when you're done using it

For the most part they end up in landfills

There's precious materials in there

we'd love to be able to get out and recycle them

but we can't do it so easily

because they're all stuck together permanently right

So here's one approach we're taking to try and solve some of these problems

and what we've done here is we've taken another long molecule

that we can actually get from corn

and then into that molecule

we've put some of the adhesion chemistry from the mussels

So because we've got the corn and we've got the mussels

we call this our surfandturf polymer

And it sticks It sticks really well

It's very strong

It's also biobased That's nice

But maybe more importantly here it's also degradable

we can degrade it under very mild conditions

just with water

And so what we can do is we can set things up

and we can bond them strongly when we want

but we can also take them apart when we want

It's something we're thinking about

And here is a place where a lot of us want to be

Actually in this specific case this is a place we do not want to be

but we'd like to replace this

So sutures staples screws

this is how we put you back together if you've had some surgery or an injury

It's just awful It hurts

In the case of the sutures

look at how much you're making concentrated mechanical stresses

as you pull things together

you're making sites for infection

poke holes in healthy tissue  it's not so good

Or if you need a plate to hold together your bones

look at how much healthy bone you have to drill out

just to hold the plate in place  so this is awful

To me it looks like these were devised in a medieval torture chamber

but it's our modern surgical joinery

So I'd love it if we'd get to a place where we can replace systems like this

with adhesives right

It's not easy

We're working on this but this is not easy

So think about what you would need for adhesives in these cases

So first of all

you would need an adhesive that will set in a wet environment

And if you look at the silly little picture there

it's just to illustrate that our bodies are about  percent water

so it's a wet environment

It's also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist

I did not miss my calling at all

So then the other requirements you need for a good biomedical adhesive

it needs to bond strongly of course

and it needs to not be toxic

You don't want to hurt the patients

And getting any two of those requirements in a material is pretty easy

It's been done many times

But getting all three hasn't been done it's very hard
 
And then if you talk to surgeons they get really picky

Oh actually I want the adhesive to set on the same time frame as the surgery

Oh okay

Or Oh I want the adhesive to degrade

so the patient's tissues can remodel the site

So this is really hard We're working on it

This is just one image we have

So we're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft tissue and hard tissue

and sometimes we'll whack it with a hammer

Usually we're cutting it in very precise shapes

then we glue them back together

We've got some exciting results some strong materials

some things that look like they're not toxic

They set wet looks pretty good

but I won't tell you we've solved the wetadhesion problem

because we haven't

but it's certainly in our sights for the future

So that's one place that we'd like to see things go farther down the road

There's lots of other places too you can imagine

we might be better off if we could get more adhesives in there

So one thing is cosmetics

So if you think about people putting on fake nails or eyelash extensions here 

like this 

what do they use

They use very toxic adhesives right now

So it's just ripe for replacement

That's something we'd like to do

And there are other places too

So think about cars and planes

The lighter you can make them

the more fuel efficient they're going to be

And so if we can get away from rivets and from welding

to put more adhesives in there

then we might be better off

with our future generation of transportation

So for us this all comes back to the beach

So we look around and we wonder How do these sea creatures stick

And what can we do with the technology

And I would argue that we have really a lot of things we can still learn

from biology and from nature

So what I'd like to encourage you all to do in the future

is put down your nonrecyclable laptops and cell phones

and go out and explore the natural world

and then start asking some of your own questions

Thanks very much

I have a tendency to assume the worst

and once in a while this habit plays tricks on me

For example if I feel unexpected pain in my body

that I have not experienced before and that I cannot attribute

then all of a sudden my mind might turn a tense back into heart disease

or calf muscle pain into deep vein thrombosis

But so far I haven't been diagnosed with any deadly or incurable disease

Sometimes things just hurt for no clear reason

But not everyone is as lucky as me

Every year more than  million people die worldwide

Especially in highincome economies like ours

a large fraction of deaths is caused by slowly progressing diseases

heart disease chronic lung disease cancer Alzheimer's diabetes

just to name a few

Now humanity has made tremendous progress in diagnosing and treating many of these

But we are at a stage where further advancement in health

cannot be achieved only by developing new treatments

And this becomes evident when we look at one aspect

that many of these diseases have in common

the probability for successful treatment

strongly depends on when treatment is started

But a disease is typically only detected once symptoms occur

The problem here is that in fact many diseases can remain asymptomatic

hence undetected for a long period of time

Because of this there is a persisting need for new ways

of detecting disease at early stage

way before any symptoms occur

In health care this is called screening

And as defined by the World Health Organization

screening is the presumptive identification of unrecognized disease

in an apparently healthy person

by means of tests  that can be applied rapidly and easily 

That's a long definition so let me repeat it

identification of unrecognized disease

in an apparently healthy person

by means of tests that can be applied both rapidly and easily

And I want to put special emphasis on the words rapidly and easily

because many of the existing screening methods

are exactly the opposite

And those of you who have undergone colonoscopy

as part of a screening program for colorectal cancer

will know what I mean

Obviously there's a variety of medical tools available

to perform screening tests

This ranges from imaging techniques such as radiography

or magnetic resonance imaging

to the analysis of blood or tissue

We have all had such tests

But there's one medium that for long has been overlooked

a medium that is easily accessible

basically nondepletable

and it holds tremendous promise for medical analysis

And that is our breath

Human breath is essentially composed of five components

nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide water and argon

But besides these five there are hundreds of other components

that are present in very low quantity

These are called volatile organic compounds

and we release hundreds even thousands of them

every time we exhale

The analysis of these volatile organic compounds in our breath

is called breath analysis

In fact I believe that many of you have already experienced breath analysis

Imagine you're driving home late at night

when suddenly there's a friendly police officer

who asks you kindly but firmly

to pull over and blow into a device like this one

This is an alcohol breath tester

that is used to measure the ethanol concentration in your breath

and determine whether driving in your condition is a clever idea

Now I'd say my driving was pretty good

but let me check

Beep

 so nothing to worry about all fine

Laughter

Now imagine a device like this one

that does not only measure alcohol levels in your breath

but that detects diseases like the ones I've shown you

and potentially many more

The concept of correlating the smell of a person's breath

with certain medical conditions

in fact dates back to Ancient Greece

But only recently research efforts on breath analysis have skyrocketed

and what once was a dream is now becoming reality

And let me pull up this list again that I showed you earlier

For the majority of diseases listed here

there's substantial scientific evidence

suggesting that the disease could be detected by breath analysis

But how does it work exactly

The essential part is a sensor device

that detects the volatile organic compounds in our breath

Simply put when exposed to a breath sample

the sensor outputs a complex signature

that results from the mixture of volatile organic compounds that we exhale

Now this signature represents a fingerprint of your metabolism

your microbiome

and the biochemical processes that occur in your body

If you have a disease

your organism will change

and so will the composition of your exhaled breath

And then the only thing that is left to do is to correlate a certain signature

with the presence or absence of certain medical conditions

The technology promises several undeniable benefits

Firstly the sensor can be miniaturized

and integrated into small handheld devices

like this alcohol breath tester

This would allow the test to be used in many different settings

and even at home

so that a visit at the doctor's office

is not needed each time a test shall be performed

Secondly breath analysis is noninvasive

and can be as simple as blowing into an alcohol breath tester

Such simplicity and ease of use would reduce patient burden

and provide an incentive for broad adoption of the technology

And thirdly the technology is so flexible

that the same device could be used

to detect a broad range of medical conditions

Breath analysis could be used to screen for multiple diseases at the same time

Nowadays each disease typically requires a different medical tool

to perform a screening test

But this means you can only find what you're looking for

With all of these features breath analysis is predestined

to deliver what many traditional screening tests are lacking

And most importantly

all of these features should eventually provide us

with a platform for medical analysis

that can operate at attractively low cost per test

On the contrary existing medical tools

often lead to rather high cost per test

Then in order to keep costs down

the number of tests needs to be restricted

and this means a that the tests can only be performed
a
on a narrow part of the population for example the highrisk population

and b that the number of tests per person needs to be kept at a minimum
b
But wouldn't it actually be beneficial

if the test was performed on a larger group of people

and more often and over a longer period of time for each individual

Especially the latter would give access to something very valuable

that is called longitudinal data

Longitudinal data is a data set that tracks the same patient

over the course of many months or years

Nowadays medical decisions are often based on a limited data set

where only a glimpse of a patient's medical history

is available for decisionmaking

In such a case

abnormalities are typically detected

by comparing a patient's health profile

to the average health profile of a reference population

Longitudinal data would open up a new dimension

and allow abnormalities to be detected

based on a patient's own medical history

This will pave the way for personalized treatment

Sounds pretty great right

Now you will certainly have a question that is something like

If the technology is as great as he says then why aren't we using it today

And the only answer I can give you is

not everything is as easy as it sounds

There are technical challenges for example

There's the need for extremely reliable sensors

that can detect mixtures of volatile organic compounds

with sufficient reproducibility

And another technical challenge is this

How do you sample a person's breath in a very defined manner

so that the sampling process itself

does not alter the result of the analysis

And there's the need for data

Breath analysis needs to be validated in clinical trials

and enough data needs to be collected

so that individual conditions can be measured against baselines

Breath analysis can only succeed

if a large enough data set can be generated

and made available for broad use

If breath analysis holds up to its promises

this is a technology that could truly aid us

to transform our health care system 

transform it from a reactive system

where treatment is triggered by symptoms of disease

to a proactive system

where disease detection diagnosis and treatment

can happen at early stage

way before any symptoms occur

Now this brings me to my last point and it's a fundamental one

What exactly is a disease

Imagine that breath analysis can be commercialized as I describe it

and early detection becomes routine

A problem that remains is in fact a problem

that any screening activity has to face

because for many diseases

it is often impossible to predict with sufficient certainty

whether the disease would ever cause any symptoms

or put a person's life at risk

This is called overdiagnosis

and it leads to a dilemma

If a disease is identified

you could decide not to treat it

because there's a certain probability that you would never suffer from it

But how much would you suffer

just from knowing that you have a potentially deadly disease

And wouldn't you actually regret that the disease was detected

in the first place

Your second option is to undergo early treatment

with the hope for curing it

But often this would not come without side effects

To be precise

the bigger problem is not overdiagnosis

it's overtreatment

because not every disease has to be treated immediately

just because a treatment is available

The increasing adoption of routine screening

will raise the question

What do we call a disease that can rationalize treatment

and what is just an abnormality that should not be a source of concern

My hopes are that routine screening using breath analysis

can provide enough data and insight

so that at some point we'll be able to break this dilemma

and predict with sufficient certainty

whether and when to treat at early stage

Our breath and the mixture of volatile organic compounds that we exhale

hold tremendous amounts of information on our physiological condition

With what we know today we have only scratched the surface

As we collect more and more data and breath profiles across the population

including all varieties of gender age origin and lifestyle

the power of breath analysis should increase

And eventually breath analysis should provide us with a powerful tool

not only to proactively detect specific diseases

but to predict and ultimately prevent them

And this should be enough motivation

to embrace the opportunities and challenges

that breath analysis can provide

even for people that are not parttime hypochondriacs like me

Thank you

OK I want to take a moment to let each of you think to yourselves

about the last time you sent or received a fax

Laughter

Well for me it was this morning

because one piece of my work

is making sure that everyone in the US has the information that they need

to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot

And collecting that information

from the local government offices responsible for maintaining it

means sending and receiving a lot of faxes

Voting is one of our most fundamental rights

It's one of the most tangible ways

that each and every one of us can shape our communities

And as we enter this fourth industrial revolution

where technology is changing everything around us

you would think with something as important as the right to vote

that we would have the most modern secure

inclusive system that could exist 

But we don't

When we look at comparable democracies

the US has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the world

We have a system where even the most persistent voters

come up against exhausting barriers

A system where thcentury technology 

like fax machines 

and outdated practices stand in the way of full vibrant participation

In US presidential elections turnout hovers around  percent

The numbers are even lower for local elections

That means that nearly  percent of Americans aren't voters

That's nearly  million people

I believe in something very straightforward

that everyone should have the information that they need to become a voter

that the voting process should be seamless and secure

and that every voter should have information they trust

to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot

Because when more people vote

together we make better decisions for our communities

So I've spent the last eight years on a mission

to push our democracy into the st century

Now one of the most common approaches to election modernization

is advocating for policy change

and that's an incredibly important piece of the strategy

for building a system where millions of more people become voters

But I've taken a different approach

I focused on a critical yet largely untapped resource

for election modernization

local election officials

I work with thousands of local election officials across the country

to build tools and skills that they can use immediately

to transform the way that they're engaging today's voters

Folks like Kat and Marie

Kat and Marie have worked together for years in a windowless office

in the basement of the Mercer County Courthouse in West Virginia

Together they have a tremendous responsibility

They're local election officials serving Mercer County's  registered voters

Local election officials are the public servants

that do the daytoday work that makes our election system function

When you fill out a voterregistration form

they're the folks that process them and add you to the rolls

They're the folks who buy the technology that we use to cast and count ballots

They recruit and train the volunteers at your local polling place

And they're the official nonpartisan source

for informing people in their communities about how to vote

And unlike other countries

where there's some form of centralized election authority

in the US

there are  different county and municipal offices

like Kat and Marie's

that each have an independent role in administering elections

Yes that's nearly  slightly different ways

that you might experience voting based on where you happen to live

When I was talking with Kat and Marie

like so many election officials that I talk with in rural towns

and in major cities alike

they were deeply proud of getting to help people in their communities

but they were also worried

All of the new tools that people were using to get information 

the internet social media 

they were difficult to figure out how to use effectively

And they felt like they weren't fully meeting the needs of Mercer County voters

One thing that they really wished that they had was a website

so they could create a hub

with information about how to register in upcoming elections

and a place to put election results

See at the time when voters had questions

they had to either call or visit their office

which meant that Kat and Marie were inevitably answering

the same questions over and over again

which is both a superinefficient use of their time

but also created totally unnecessary barriers for voters

when that information could just live online

And Mercer County wasn't alone

At the time they were one of  counties in the US

that had no voting information online

I'll let that sink in

They were one of the nearly onethird of counties in the US

that had no place online

to find official information about how to vote

To Kat and Marie not having and election website was unacceptable

but they didn't have very many options

They didn't have the budget to hire a web developer

they didn't have the expertise to build a site themselves

so they went without

And  voters in Mercer County went without

We're in a moment where we have an unprecedented opportunity

to transform civic engagement

Technology is revolutionizing science and industry

It's already transformed how we connect with one another

and understand the world around us

but our democratic institutions 

they're being left behind

The US is one of the few major democracies in the world

that puts the onus of voter registration on the individual voter

rather than the government

The rules that govern how to vote vary from state to state

and sometimes even county to county

And we have ballots that are pages and pages long

This November on my ballot

there are literally over  different people and referenda

for me to make decisions about

We have to be using the best tools we can bring to bear

to help voters navigate this complexity

and right now we're not

One of the most common narratives I hear in my work

is that people aren't civically engaged because they're apathetic 

because they don't care

But as my brilliant friends at the Center for Civic Design say

if there is apathy

it comes from the system

not the voter

We can change the system right now

by connecting local election officials like Kat and Marie

with stcentury tools

and the training that they need to use them to better serve voters

Tools and training to do things like use social media for voter engagement

or use data to staff and equip polling places

so that we don't see hourslong lines at the polls

or training on cybersecurity best practices

so that we can ensure that our voting systems are secure

When we invest in this approach

we see meaningful lasting results

Kat and Marie are online now

Inspired by their experience we built a website template

using researchbased best practices in civic design

and developed the training

so that Kat and Marie are able to maintain their site themselves

In less than a week

they went from having never seen the back end of a website

to building a resource for Mercer County voters

that they have been independently keeping up to date since 

Today the  voters in Mercer County

and over  voters in counties across the country

have everything that they need to become a voter

directly from their local election official

on a mobilefriendly easytouse accessible website

And we can even further scale the impact

when local election officials are not only reaching out

through their own channels

but they're extending their reach by working in partnership with others

Efforts like the Ballot Information Project
Ballot Information Project
and the Voting Information Project work with election officials nationwide

to create a centralized standard database of key voting information

like what's on your ballot and where to vote

That information powers tools built by companies like Google and Facebook
GoogleFacebook
to get information in the places where people already are

like their newsfeed and search
feedsearch
In  the Ballot Information Project
Ballot
connected the public with information about candidates and referenda

over  millions times

helping between a third and a half of every single person who cast a ballot

And that model has been replicated for elections around the world

When we look at efforts in other areas of government

we can see the opportunity when we listen to the public's needs

and we meet them with modern tools

I think about my friends at mRelief
m Relief
who have helped  families

unlock  million dollars in food benefits

by helping government agencies transition away

from a page paperbased application for food stamps

to a process that can happen in  questions over text message

in fewer than three minutes

That kind of transformation is possible in voting

It's happening right now

but there's still so much work to do

Now if you have any technical bone in your body

I know what you're thinking

This is all solvable

The technology that we need exists

We collectively have the expertise

You might even be thinking about volunteering

at your local election office

I love how solutionsoriented you are

but to be clear

the work that is needed to modernize our election system

isn't something that's going to happen using  percent time

or through a hackathon

or by doing a oneoff technology project

What we need is significant sustained longterm investment

Investment in technology

and investment in the skills of local election officials

to run stcentury elections

because if we don't invest in the long game

we risk finding ourselves perpetually behind

So if you're ready to help millions

if you're ready to close the gap between the system that we have

and the system that we deserve

we need you

Organizations that are doing this work yearround need you

Local election offices need you

Come join us

Thank you

Nobody likes to make a mistake

And I made a whopping one

And figuring out what I did wrong led to a discovery

that completely changes the way we think about the Earth and Moon

I'm a planetary scientist

and my favorite thing to do is smash planets together

Laughter

In my lab I can shoot at rocks using cannons like this one

Cannon shot

Laughter

In my experiments I can generate the extreme conditions

during planet formation

And with computer models I can collide whole planets together

to make them grow

or I can destroy them

Laughter

I want to understand how to make the Earth and the Moon

and why the Earth is so different from other planets

The leading idea for the origin of the Earth and Moon

is called the giant impact theory

The theory states that a Marssized body struck the young Earth

and the Moon formed from the debris disk around the planet

The theory can explain so many things about the Moon

but it has a huge flaw

it predicts that the Moon is mostly made from the Marssized planet

that the Earth and the Moon are made from different materials

But that's not what we see

The Earth and the Moon are actually like identical twins

The genetic code of planets is written in the isotopes of the elements

The Earth and Moon have identical isotopes

That means that the Earth and Moon are made from the same materials

It's really strange that the Earth and the Moon are twins

All of the planets are made from different materials

so they all have different isotopes

they all have their own genetic code

No other planetary bodies have the same genetic relationship

Only the Earth and Moon are twins

When I started working on the origin of the Moon

there were scientists that wanted to reject the whole idea of the giant impact

They didn't see any way for this theory to explain the special relationship

between the Earth and the Moon

We were all trying to think of new ideas

The problem was there weren't any better ideas

All of the other ideas had even bigger flaws

So we were trying to rescue the giant impact theory

A young scientist in my group suggested that we try changing the spin

of the giant impact

Maybe making the Earth spin faster could mix more material

and explain the Moon

The Marssized impactor had been chosen

because it could make the Moon

and make the length of Earth's day

People really liked that part of the model

But what if something else determined the length of Earth's day

Then there would be many more possible giant impacts that could make the Moon

I was curious about what could happen

so I tried simulating fasterspinning giant impacts

and I found that it is possible

to make a disk out of the same mixture of materials as the planet

We were pretty excited

Maybe this was the way to explain the Moon

The problem is we also found that that's just not very likely

Most of the time the disk is different from the planet

and it looked like making our Moon this way

would be an astronomical coincidence

and it was just hard for everyone to accept the idea

that the Moon's special connection to Earth was an accident

The giant impact theory was still in trouble

and we were still trying to figure out how to make the Moon

Then came the day when I realized my mistake

My student and I were looking at the data from these fastspinning giant impacts

On that day we weren't actually thinking about the Moon

we were looking at the planet

The planet gets superhot and partially vaporized

from the energy of the impact

But the data didn't look like a planet

It looked really strange

The planet was weirdly connected to the disk

I got that superexcited feeling

when something really wrong might be something really interesting

In all of my calculations

I had assumed there was a planet with a separate disk around it

Calculating what was in the disk as how we tested

whether an impact could make the Moon

But it didn't look that simple anymore

We were making the mistake

of thinking that a planet was always going to look like a planet

On that day I knew that a giant impact was making something completely new

I've had eureka moments

This was not one of them

Laughter

I really didn't know what was going on

I had this strange new object in front of me

and the challenge to try and figure it out

What do you do when faced with the unknown

How do you even start

We questioned everything

What is a planet

When is a planet no longer a planet anymore

We played with new ideas

We had to get rid of our old way of thinking

and by playing I could throw away all of the data

all of the rules of the real world

and free my mind to explore

And by making a mental space

where I could try out outrageous ideas

and then bring them back into the real world to test them

I could learn

And by playing we learned so much

I combined my lab experiments with computer models

and discovered that after most giant impacts

the Earth is so hot there's no surface

There's just a deep layer of gas that gets denser and denser with depth

The Earth would have been like Jupiter

There's nothing to stand on

And that was just part of the problem

I wanted to understand the whole problem

I couldn't let go of the challenge to figure out what was really going on

in giant impacts

It took almost two years

of throwing away old ideas

and building new ones

that we understood the data

and knew what it meant for the Moon

I discovered a new type of astronomical object

It's not a planet

It's made from planets

A planet is a body whose selfgravity

is strong enough to give it its rounded shape

It spins around all together

Make it hotter and spin it faster

the equator gets bigger and bigger until it reaches a tipping point

Push past the tipping point

and the material at the equator spreads into a disk

It's now broken all the rules of being a planet

It can't spin around together anymore

its shape keeps changing as it gets bigger and bigger

the planet has become something new

We gave our discovery its name

synestia
Synestia
We named it after the goddess Hestia

the Greek goddess of the hearth and home

because we think the Earth became one

The prefix means all together

to emphasize the connection between all of the material

A synestia is what a planet becomes

when heat and spin push it over the limit of a spheroidal shape

Would you like to see a synestia
synestia
Cheers

In this visualization of one of my simulations

the young Earth is already spinning quickly from a previous giant impact

Its shape is deformed but our planet would be recognizable

by the water on its surface

The energy from the impact vaporizes the surface

the water the atmosphere

and mixes all of the gases together in just a few hours

We discovered that many giant impacts make synestias
synestias
but these burning bright objects don't live very long

They cool down shrink and turn back into planets

While rocky planets like Earth were growing

they probably turned into synestias one or more times
synsetia
A synestia gives us a new way to solve the problem of the origin of the Moon

We propose that the Moon formed inside a huge vaporous synestia

The Moon grew from magma rain

that condensed out of the rock vapor

The Moon's special connection to Earth

is because the Moon formed inside the Earth

when Earth was a synestia

The Moon could have orbited inside the synestia for years

hidden from view

The Moon is revealed by the synestia cooling and shrinking

inside of its orbit

The synestia turns into planet Earth

only after cooling for hundreds of years longer

In our new theory

the giant impact makes a synestia

and the synestia divides into two new bodies

creating our isotopically identical Earth and Moon

Synestias have been created throughout the universe
Synestias
And we only just realized that by finding them in our imagination

What else am I missing in the world around me

What is hidden from my view by my own assumptions

The next time you look at the Moon

remember

the things you think you know

may be the opportunity to discover something truly amazing

When I was in the sixth grade I got into a fight at school

It wasn't the first time I'd been in a fight

but it was the first time one happened at school

It was with a boy who was about a foot taller than me

who was physically stronger than me

and who'd been taunting me for weeks

One day in PE he stepped on my shoe and refused to apologize

So filled with anger I grabbed him and I threw him to the ground

I'd had some previous judo training

Laughter

Our fight lasted less than two minutes

but it was a perfect reflection of the hurricane

that was building inside of me

as a young survivor of sexual assault

and as a girl who was grappling with abandonment

and exposure to violence in other spaces in my life

I was fighting him

but I was also fighting the men and boys that had assaulted my body

and the culture that told me I had to be silent about it

A teacher broke up the fight

and my principal called me in her office

But she didn't say Monique what's wrong with you

She gave me a moment to collect my breath

and asked What happened

The educators working with me led with empathy

They knew me

They knew I loved to read they knew I loved to draw

they knew I adored Prince

And they used that information to help me understand

why my actions and those of my classmate were disruptive

to the learning community they were leading

They didn't place me on suspension

they didn't call the police

My fight didn't keep me from going to school the next day

It didn't keep me from graduating it didn't keep me from teaching
 
But unfortunately that's not a story that's shared by many black girls

in the US and around the world today

We're living through a crisis in which black girls

are being disproportionately pushed away from schools 

not because of an imminent threat they pose to the safety of a school

but because they're often experiencing schools

as locations for punishment and marginalization

That's something that I hear from black girls around the country

But it's not insurmountable

We can shift this narrative

Let's start with some data

According to a National Black Women's Justice Institute analysis

of civil rights data

collected by the US Department of Education

black girls are the only group of girls who are overrepresented

along the entire continuum of discipline in schools

That doesn't mean that other girls aren't experiencing exclusionary discipline

and it doesn't mean that other girls aren't overrepresented

at other parts along that continuum

But black girls are the only group of girls

who are overrepresented all along the way

Black girls are seven times more likely than their white counterparts

to experience one or more outofschool suspensions

and they're nearly three times more likely than their white and Latinx counterparts

to be referred to the juvenile court

A recent study by the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality

partially explained why this disparity is taking place

when they confirmed that black girls experience

a specific type of age compression

where they're seen as more adultlike than their white peers

Among other things the study found

that people perceive black girls to need less nurturing

less protection to know more about sex

and to be more independent than their white peers

The study also found

that the perception disparity begins when girls are as young as five years old

And that this perception and the disparity increases over time

and peaks when girls are between the ages of  and 

This is not without consequence

Believing that a girl is older than she is can lead to harsher treatment

immediate censure when she makes a mistake

and victim blaming when she's harmed

It can also lead a girl to think that something is wrong with her

rather than the conditions in which she finds herself

Black girls are routinely seen as too loud too aggressive

too angry too visible

Qualities that are often measured in relation to nonblack girls

and which don't take into consideration what's going on in this girl's life

or her cultural norms

And it's not just in the US

In South Africa

black girls at the Pretoria Girls High School

were discouraged from attending school with their hair in its natural state

without chemical processing

What did those girls do

They protested

And it was a beautiful thing to see the global community for the most part

wrap its arms around girls as they stood in their truths

But there were those who saw them as disruptive

largely because they dared to ask the question

Where can we be black if we can't be black in Africa

Laughter

Applause

It's a good question

Around the world

black girls are grappling with this question

And around the world

black girls are struggling to be seen working to be free

and fighting to be included

in the landscape of promise that a safe space to learn provides

In the US little girls just past their toddler years

are being arrested in classrooms for having a tantrum

Middle school girls are being turned away from school

because of the way they wear their hair naturally

or because of the way the clothes fit their bodies

High school girls are experiencing violence

at the hands of police officers in schools

Where can black girls be black without reprimand or punishment

And it's not just these incidents

In my work as a researcher and educator

I've had an opportunity to work with girls like Stacy

a girl who I profile in my book Pushout

who struggles with her participation in violence

She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses

that science has to offer

about how her adverse childhood experiences inform

why she's participating in violence

and goes straight to describing herself as a problem child

largely because that's the language that educators were using

as they routinely suspended her

But here's the thing

Disconnection and the internalization of harm grow stronger in isolation

So when girls get in trouble we shouldn't be pushing them away

we should be bringing them in closer

Education is a critical protective factor

against contact with the criminal legal system

So we should be building out policies and practices

that keep girls connected to their learning

rather than pushing them away from it

It's one of the reasons I like to say that education is freedom work

When girls feel safe they can learn

When they don't feel safe they fight

they protest they argue they flee they freeze

The human brain is wired to protect us when we feel a threat

And so long as school feels like a threat

or part of the tapestry of harm in a girl's life

she'll be inclined to resist

But when schools become locations for healing

they can also become locations for learning

So what does this mean for a school to become a location for healing

Well for one thing it means that we have to immediately discontinue

the policies and practices that target black girls for their hairstyles or dress

Applause

Let's focus on how and what a girl learns

rather than policing her body in ways that facilitate rape culture

or punish children for the conditions in which they were born

This is where parents and the community of concerned adults can enter this work

Start a conversation with the school

and encourage them to address their dress code

and other conductrelated policies as a collaborative project

with parents and students

so as to intentionally avoid bias and discrimination

Keep in mind though

that some of the practices that harm black girls most are unwritten

So we have to continue to do the deep internal work to address the biases

that inform how when and whether we see black girls for who they actually are

or what we've been told they are

Volunteer at a school

and establish culturally competent and gender responsive discussion groups

with black girls Latinas indigenous girls

and other students who experience marginalization in schools

to give them a safe space

to process their identities and experiences in schools

And if schools are to become locations for healing

we have to remove police officers

and increase the number of counselors in schools

Applause

Education is freedom work

And whatever our point of entry is we all have to be freedom fighters

The good news is that there are schools

that are actively working to establish themselves

as locations for girls to see themselves as sacred and loved

The Columbus City Prep School for Girls in Columbus Ohio is an example of this

They became an example the moment their principal declared

that they were no longer going to punish girls for having a bad attitude

In addition to building 

Essentially what they did is they built out a robust continuum

of alternatives to suspension expulsion and arrest

In addition to establishing a restorative justice program

they improved their student and teacher relationships

by ensuring that every girl has at least one adult on campus

that she can go to when she's in a moment of crisis

They built out spaces along the corridors of the school and in classrooms

for girls to regroup if they need a minute to do so

And they established an advisory program that provides girls with an opportunity

to start every single day with the promotion of selfworth

communication skills and goal setting

At this school

they're trying to respond to a girl's adverse childhood experiences

rather than ignore them

They bring them in closer they don't push them away
 
And as a result their truancy and suspension rates have improved

and girls are arriving at school increasingly ready to learn

because they know the teachers there care about them

That matters

Schools that integrate the arts and sports into their curriculum

or that are building out tranformative programming

such as restorative justice mindfulness and meditation

are providing an opportunity for girls to repair their relationships with others

but also with themselves

Responding to the lived complex and historical trauma

that our students face

requires all of us who believe in the promise of children and adolescents

to build relationships learning materials

human and financial resources and other tools

that provide children with an opportunity to heal so that they can learn

Our schools should be places where we respond to our most vulnerable girls

as essential to the creation of a positive school culture

Our ability to see her promise should be at its sharpest

when she's in the throws of poverty and addiction

when she's reeling from having been sextrafficked

or survived other forms of violence

when she's at her loudest

or her quietest

We should be able to support her intellectual

and socialemotional wellbeing

whether her shorts reach her knees or stop midthigh or higher

It might seem like a tall order in a world

so deeply entrenched in the politics of fear

to radically imagine schools as locations where girls can heal and thrive

but we have to be bold enough to set this as our intention

If we commit to this notion of education as freedom work

we can shift educational conditions

so that no girl even the most vulnerable among us

will get pushed out of school

And that's a win for all of us

Thank you

Applause

Do you hear that

Do you know what that is

Silence

The sound of silence

Simon and Garfunkel wrote a song about it

But silence is a pretty rare commodity these days

and we're all paying a price for it in terms of our health 

a surprisingly big price as it turns out

Luckily there are things we can do right now

both individually and as a society

to better protect our health

and give us more of the benefits of the sounds of silence

I assume that most of you know that too much noise is bad for your hearing

Whenever you leave a concert or a bar and you have that ringing in your ears

you can be certain that you have done some damage to your hearing

likely permanent

And that's very important

However noise affects our health in many different ways beyond hearing

They're less wellknown

but they're just as dangerous as the auditory effects

So what do we mean when we talk about noise

Well noise is defined as unwanted sound

and as such both has a physical component the sound

and a psychological component

the circumstances that make the sound unwanted

A very good example is a rock concert

A person attending the rock concert being exposed to  decibels

does not think of the music as noise

This person likes the band and even paid a hundred dollars for the ticket

so no matter how loud the music this person doesn't think of it as noise

In contrast think of a person living three blocks away from the concert hall

That person is trying to read a book

but cannot concentrate because of the music

And although the sound pressure levels are much lower in this situation

this person still thinks of the music as noise

and it may trigger reactions that can in the long run have health consequences

So why are quiet spaces so important

Because noise affects our health in so many ways beyond hearing

However it's becoming increasingly difficult to find quiet spaces

in times of constantly increasing traffic

growing urbanization

construction sites airconditioning units

leaf blowers lawnmowers

outdoor concerts and bars personal music players

and your neighbors partying until am

Whew

In  the World Health Organization estimated

that  million healthy life years are lost every year

due to exposure to environmental noise

in the Western European member states alone

One important effect of noise is that it disturbs communication

You may have to raise your voice to be understood

In extreme cases you may even have to pause the conversation

It's also more likely to be misunderstood in a noisy environment

These are all likely reasons why studies have found

that children who attend schools in noisy areas

are more likely to lag behind their peers in academic performance

Another very important health effect of noise

is the increased risk for cardiovascular disease

in those who are exposed to relevant noise levels

for prolonged periods of time

Noise is stress

especially if we have little or no control over it

Our body excretes stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol

that lead to changes in the composition of our blood

and in the structure of our blood vessels

which have been shown to be stiffer after a single night of noise exposure

Epidemiological studies show associations between the noise exposure

and an increased risk for high blood pressure

heart attacks and stroke

and although the overall risk increases are relatively small

this still constitutes a major public health problem

because noise is so ubiquitous

and so many people are exposed to relevant noise levels

A recent study found that US society

could save  billion dollars each year

by lowering environmental noise exposure by five decibels

just by saving costs for treating cardiovascular disease

There are other diseases like cancer diabetes and obesity

that have been linked to noise exposure

but we do not have enough evidence yet

to in fact conclude that these diseases are caused by the noise

Yet another important effect of noise is sleep disturbance

Sleep is a very active mechanism that recuperates us

and prepares us for the next wake period

A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone of what sleep researchers call

a good sleep hygiene

And our auditory system has a watchman function

It's constantly monitoring our environment for threats

even while we're sleeping

So noise in the bedroom can cause a delay in the time it takes us to fall asleep

it can wake us up during the night

and it can prevent our blood pressure from going down during the night

We have the hypothesis that if these noiseinduced sleep disturbances

continue for months and years

then an increased risk for cardiovascular disease is likely the consequence

However we are often not aware of these noiseinduced sleep disturbances

because we are unconscious while we're sleeping

In the past we've done studies on the effects of traffic noise on sleep

and research subjects would often wake up in the morning and say

Ah I had a wonderful night I fell asleep right away

never really woke up

When we would go back to the physiological signals

we had recorded during the night

we would often see numerous awakenings

and a severely fragmented sleep structure

These awakenings were too brief for the subjects to regain consciousness

and to remember them during the next morning

but they may nevertheless have a profound impact

on how restful our sleep is

So when is loud too loud

A good sign of too loud is once you start changing your behavior

You may have to raise your voice to be understood

or you increase the volume of your TV

You're avoiding outside areas or you're closing your window

You're moving your bedroom to the basement of the house

or you even have sound insulation installed

Many people will move away to less noisy areas

but obviously not everybody can afford that

So what can we do right now to improve our sound environment

and to better protect our health

Well first of all if something's too loud speak up

For example many owners of movie theaters

seem to think that only people hard of hearing are still going to the movies

If you complain about the noise and nothing happens

demand a refund and leave

That's the language that managers typically do understand

Also talk to your children about the health effects of noise

and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they're older

You can also move your bedroom to the quiet side of the house

where your own building shields you from road traffic noise

If you're looking to rent or buy a new place

make low noise a priority

Visit the property during different times of the day

and talk to the neighbors about noise

You can wear noisecanceling headphones when you're traveling

or if your office has high background noise levels

In general seek out quiet spaces

especially on the weekend or when you're on vacation

Allow your system to wind down

I very appropriately for this talk

attended a noise conference in Japan four years ago

When I returned to the United States and entered the airport

a wall of sound hit me

This tells you that we don't realize anymore

the constant degree of noise pollution we're exposed to

and how much we could profit from more quiet spaces

What else can we do about noise

Well very much like a carbon footprint we all have a noise footprint

and there are things we can do to make that noise footprint smaller

For example don't start mowing your lawn at am on a Saturday morning

Your neighbors will thank you

Or use a rake instead of a leaf blower

In general noise reduction at the source makes the most sense

so whenever you're looking to buy a new car

airconditioning unit blender you name it

make low noise a priority

Many manufacturers will list the noise levels their devices generate

and some even advertise with them

Use that information

Many people think that stronger noise regulation and enforcement are good ideas

even obvious solutions perhaps

but it's not as easy as you may think

because many of the activities that generate noise

also generate revenue

Think about an airport and all the business that is associated with it

Our research tells politicians at what noise level

they can expect a certain health effect

and that helps inform better noise policy

Robert Koch supposedly once said

One day mankind will fight noise as relentlessly as cholera and the pest

I think we're there

and I hope that we will win this fight

and when we do we can all have a nice quiet celebration

Laughter

Thank you

So my story starts on July  

the day my mother followed her college sweetheart

to New York City from Egypt

As fireworks exploded behind the skyline

my father looked at my mother jokingly and said

Look habibti

Americans are celebrating your arrival

Laughter

Unfortunately it didn't feel much like a celebration

when growing up my mother and I would wander past Queens

into New York City streets

and my mother with her hijab and long flowy dresses

would tighten her hand around my small fingers

as she stood up against weathered comments like

Go back to where you came from

Learn English

Stupid immigrant

These words were meant to make us feel unsafe insecure

in our own neighborhoods in our own skin

But it was these same streets

that made me fall in love with New York

Queens is one of the most diverse places in the world

with immigrant parents holding stories that always start

with something between three and  dollars in a pocket

a voyage across a vast sea

and a cashonly hustle

sheltering families in jampacked busted apartments

And it was these same families

that worked so hard to make sure that we had safe microcommunities 

we as immigrant children

to feel affirmed and loved in our identities

But it was mostly the women

And these women are the reason why

regardless of these statements that my mom faced

she remained unapologetic

And these women were some of the most powerful women

I have ever met in my entire life

I mean they had networks for everything

They had rotations for who watched whose kids when

for saving extra cash

for throwing belly dance parties

and memorizing Koran and learning English

And they would collect small gold tokens

to fundraise for the local mosque

And it was these same women

when I decided to wear my hijab

who supported me through it

And when I was bullied for being Muslim

I always felt like I had an army of unapologetic North African aunties

who had my back

And so every morning at 

I would wake up and stand in front of a mirror

and wrap beautiful bright silk around my head

the way my mother does and my grandmother did

And one day that summer 

I stepped out into the streets of New York City

on my way to volunteer at a domestic violence organization

that a woman in my neighborhood had started

And I remember at that moment I felt a yank at the back of my head

Then someone pulled and grabbed me

trying to remove my hijab from off of my head

I turned around to a tall broadshouldered man

pure hate in his eyes

I struggled and fought back

and finally was able to get away

hid myself in the bathroom of that organization and cried and cried

I kept thinking to myself

Why does he hate me

He doesn't even know me

Hate crimes against Muslims in the US

increased by  percent post

and one in every four women in the US

will suffer some form of gender violence

And it may not seem like it

but Islamophobia and antiMuslim violence

is a form of gender violence

given the visibility of Muslim women in our hijabs

And so I was not alone

and that horrified me

It made me want to do something

It made me want to go out there and make sure that no one I loved

that no woman would have to feel this insecure in her own skin

So I started to think about how the women in my own neighborhood

were able to build community for themselves

and how they were able to use the very little resources they had

to actually offer something

And I began to think about what I could potentially offer

to build safety and power for women

And through this journey

I learned a couple of things

and this is what I want to share with you today some of these lessons

So lesson number one

start with what you know

At the time I had been doing Shotokan karate

for as long as I could remember

and so I had a black belt

Yeah And so I thought  surprise

Laughter

I thought that maybe I should go out into my neighborhood

and teach selfdefense to young girls

And so I actually went out and knocked on doors

spoke to community leaders to parents to young women

and finally was able to secure a free community center basement

and convince enough young women that they should come to my class

And it actually all worked out

because when I pitched the idea

most of the responses were like

All right cute

this ' hijabi girl who knows karate

How nice

But in reality I became the Queens New York version of Mr Miyagi

at  years old

and I started teaching  young women in that community center basement

selfdefense

And with every single selfdefense move

for eight sessions over the course of that summer

we began to understand the power of our bodies

and we began to share our experiences

about our identities

And sometimes there were shocking realizations

and other times there were tears

but mostly it was laughs

And I ended that summer with this incredible sisterhood

and I began to feel much safer in my own skin

And it was because of these women that we just kept teaching

I never thought that I would continue but we just kept teaching

And today nine years  cities

 countries  courses

and thousands of women and girls later

I'm still teaching

And what started as a selfdefense course

in the basement of a community center

is now an international grassroots organization

focused on building safety and power for women around the world

Malikah

Applause

Now for lesson number two

start with who you know

Oftentimes it could be quite exciting

especially if you're an expert in something

and you want to have impact

to swoop into a community and think you have the magic recipe

But very early on I learned

that as esteemed philosopher Kendrick Lamar once said

it's really important to be humble and to sit down

So basically at  years old

the only community that I had any business doing work with

were the yearold girls in my neighborhood

and that's because I was friends with them

Other than that I didn't know what it meant to be a child

of Bengali immigrants in Brooklyn

or to be Senegalese in the Bronx

But I did know young women who were connected to those communities

and it was quite remarkable how they already had

these layers of trust and awareness and relationship with their communities

So like my mother and the women in her neighborhood

they had these really strong social networks

and it was about providing capacity

and believing in other women's definition of safety

Even though I was a selfdefense instructor

I couldn't come into a community

and define safety for any other woman

who was not part of my own community

And it was because as our network expanded

I learned that selfdefense is not just physical

It's actually really emotional work

I mean we would do a minute selfdefense class

and then we'd have  minutes reserved for just talking and healing

And in those  minutes

women would share what brought them to the class to begin with

but also various other experiences with violence

And as an example one time in one of those classes

one woman actually started to talk about the fact

that she had been in a domestic violence relationship for over  years

and it was her first time being able to articulate that

because we had established that safe space for her

So it's powerful work

but it only happens when we believe in women's agency to define

what safety and what power looks like for themselves

All right for lesson number three 

and this was the hardest thing for me 

the most important thing about this work is to start with the joy

When I started doing this work I was reacting to a hatebased attack

so I was feeling insecure and anxious and overwhelmed

I was really afraid

And it makes sense because if you take a step back

and I can imagine that a lot of women in this room can probably relate to this

the feeling an overwhelming feeling of insecurity

is oftentimes with us constantly

I mean imagine this

walking home late at night hearing footsteps behind you

You wonder if you should walk faster or if you should slow down

You keep your keys in your hand in case you need to use them

You say Text me when you get home I want to make sure you are safe

And we mean those words

We're afraid to put down our drinks

We're afraid to speak too much or too little in a meeting

And imagine being woman and black and trans and queer and Latinx

and undocumented and poor and immigrant

and you could then only imagine how overwhelming this work can be

especially within the context of personal safety

However when I took a step to reflect

on what brought me to this work to begin with

I began to realize it was actually the love that I had

for women in my community

It was the way I saw them gather

their ability to build for each other

that inspired me to keep doing this work

day in and day out

So whether I was in a refugee camp in Jordan

or a community center in Dallas Texas

or a corporate office in Silicon Valley

women gathered in beautifully magical ways

and they built together and supported each other

in ways that shifted culture

to empower and build safety for women

And that is how the change happens

It was through those relationships we built together

That's why we don't just teach selfdefense

but we also throw dance parties

and host potlucks

and write love notes to each other

and sing songs together

And it's really about the friendship

and it's been so so fun

So the last thing I want to leave you with

is that the key takeaway for me in teaching selfdefense all of these years

is that I actually don't want women as cool as the selfdefense moves are

to go out and use these selfdefense techniques

I don't want any woman to have to deescalate any violent situation

But for that to happen

the violence shouldn't happen

and for the violence not to happen

the systems and the cultures

that allow for this violence to take place to begin with needs to stop

And for that to happen we need all hands on deck

So I've given you my secret recipe

and now it's up to you

To start with what you know to start with who you know

and to start with joy But just start

Thank you so much

Applause

So for the past  years

I've been obsessed with this idea

that climate change is an information issue

that computers will help us fight

I went from data science to climate policy research

from tech to public service

in pursuit of better data

to avoid the wasted energy resources opportunities

that lead to runaway carbon emissions

Until one day running in the streets with a friend it hit me

the same cars factories power plants

whose emissions are wrecking our climate over time

also release harmful local pollutants

that threaten our health right here and right now

All this time I'd focused on the longterm environmental risk

when I should have been up in arms

about the immediate health impact of pollutants in the air

Air pollution is a burning public health crisis

It kills seven million people every year

it costs five trillion dollars to the world economy

and worst it robs us of our most precious gift

the years in our lives

six months of life expectancy in my hometown of Paris

and up to three four five years in parts of India and China

And in the US more people die from car exhaust than from car accidents

So how do we protect ourselves from pollution

The reason it's difficult is an information gap

We simply lack the data to understand our exposure

And that's because the way we monitor air quality today

is designed not to help people breathe but to help governments govern

Most major cities operate networks of airquality monitoring stations

like this one in London

to decide when to cut traffic or when to shut down factories

And these machines are like the computers from the 's

that filled entire rooms

They're incredibly precise but incredibly large

heavy costly 

so much that you can only deploy just a few of them

and they cannot move

So to governments air pollution looks like this

But for the rest of us

air quality looks like this

It changes all the time

hour by hour street by street

up to eight times within a single city block

And even more from indoor to outdoor

So unless you happen to be walking right next to one of those stations

they just cannot tell you what you breathe

So what would environmental protection look like

if it was designed for the age of the smartphone

So for the past three years

my team and I have been building a technology

that helps you know what you breathe

and fits in your hand

Flow is a personal airquality tracker that you can wear with you
Flow
on a backpack a bike a stroller

It's packed with miniature sensors

that monitor the most important pollutants in the air around you

like nitrogen oxides

the exhaust gas from cars

or particulate matter that gets into your bloodstream

and creates strokes and heart issues

Or volatile organic compounds

the thousands of chemicals in everyday products

that we end up breathing

And that makes this data actionable

and helps you understand what you're breathing

by telling you where and when you've been exposed to poor air quality

and that way you can make informed decisions

to take action against pollution

You can change the products you use at home

you can find the best route to cycle to work

you can run when pollution is not peaking

and you can find the best park to bring your children out

Over time you build better habits to decrease your exposure to pollution

and by tracking air quality around them

cyclists commuters parents

will also contribute to mapping air quality in their city

So we're building more than a device

but a community

And last summer

we sent early prototypes of our technology to  volunteers in London

and together they mapped air quality

across  miles of sidewalk

and  percent of all of central London

So our goal now is to scale this work around the world

to crowdsource data so we can map air quality on every street

to build an unprecedented database

so scientists can research pollution

and to empower citizens civic leaders policy makers

to support cleanair policies for change

Because this can and must change

Remember cigarettes in bars

It took decades of lung cancer research and secondhand smoking studies

but eventually we reached a tipping point and we passed smokingban laws

We must reach the same tipping point for air quality and I believe we will

In the past couple years alone

governments have fined carmakers record amounts

for cheating on emission standards

Cities have passed congestion charges or built bike lanes 

like Paris that turned this highway

right next to my home in the middle of the city

into a waterfront park

And now mayors around the world are thinking of banning diesel outright

by   

But how much faster could we go how many lives could we save

Technology alone will not solve climate change

nor will it make air pollution disappear overnight

But it can make the quality of our air much more transparent

and if we can empower people

to take action to improve their own health

then together we can act to bring an end to our pollution

Thank you very much

Why are transgender people suddenly everywhere

Laughter

As a trans activist I get this question a lot

Keep in mind less than one percent of American adults

openly identify as trans
trans
According to a recent GLAAD survey about  percent of nontrans Americans
GLAAD
claim to know a trans person in real life

So for the other  percent this may seem like a new topic

But trans people are not new

Gender variance is older than you think

and trans people are part of that legacy

From central Africa to South America to the Pacific Islands and beyond

there have been populations who recognize multiple genders

and they go way back

The hijra of India and Pakistan for example

have been cited as far back as  years ago in the Kama Sutra

Indigenous American nations each have their own terms

but most share the umbrella term twospirit

They saw gendervariant people

as shamans and healers in their communities

and it wasn't until the spread of colonialism

that they were taught to think otherwise

Now in researching trans history

we look for both trans people and trans practices

Take for example the women who presented as men

so they could fight in the US Civil War

After the war most resumed their lives as women

but some like Albert Cashier continued to live as men
Albert Cashier
Albert was eventually confined to an asylum

and forced to wear a dress for the rest of his life

Sighs

Around  a group of selfdescribed androgynes

formed the Cercle Hermaphroditos

Their mission was to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution

And in doing that they became one of the earliest trans support groups

By the 's and 's medical researchers were starting to study trans medicine

but they were aided by their trans patients

like Louise Lawrence a trans woman who had corresponded extensively

with people who had been arrested for public crossdressing

She introduced sexual researchers like Alfred Kinsey

to a massive trans network

Other early figures would follow

like Virginia Prince Reed Erickson and the famous Christine Jorgensen

who made headlines with her very public transition in 

But while white trans suburbanites were forming their own support networks

many trans people of color had to carve their own path

Some like Miss Major GriffinGracy walked in drag balls

Others were the socalled street queens

who were often targeted by police for their gender expression

and found themselves on the forefront of seminal events

in the LGBT rights movement
LGBT
This brings us to the riots at Cooper Donuts in 
Cooper Donut
Compton's Cafeteria in 

and the famous Stonewall Inn in 

In  Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson
Sylvia RiveraMarsha PJohnson
two veterans of Stonewall

established STAR Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries
Established STAR Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries
Trans people continued to fight for equal treatment under the law

even as they faced higher rates of discrimination

unemployment arrests and the looming AIDS epidemic

For as long as we've been around

those in power have sought to disenfranchise trans people

for daring to live lives that are ours

This motion picture still taken in Berlin in 

is sometimes used in history textbooks

to illustrate how the Nazis burned works they considered unGerman

But what's rarely mentioned is that included in this massive pile

are works from the Institute for Sexual Research

See I just recapped the trans movement in America

but Magnus Hirschfeld and his peers in Germany
Magnus Hirschfeld
had us beat by a few decades

Magnus Hirschfeld was an early advocate for LGBT people
Magnus HirschfeldLGBT
He wrote the first booklength account of trans individuals

He helped them obtain medical services and IDs

He worked with the Berlin Police Department

to end discrimination of LGBT people
LGBT
and he hired them at the Institute

So when the Nazi Party burned his library

it had devastating implications for trans research around the world

This was a deliberate attempt to erase trans people

and it was neither the first nor the last

So whenever people ask me why trans people are suddenly everywhere

I just want to tell them that we've been here

These stories have to be told

along with the countless others that have been buried by time

Not only were our lives not celebrated but our struggles have been forgotten

and yeah to some people that makes trans issues seem new

Today I meet a lot of people who think that our movement

is just a phase that will pass

but I also hear wellintentioned allies telling us all to be patient

because our movement is still new

Imagine how the conversation would shift

if we acknowledge just how long trans people have been demanding equality

Are we still overreacting

Should we continue to wait

Or should we for example

do something about the trans women of color who are murdered

and whose killers never see justice

Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet

Sighs

Finally I want other trans people to realize they're not alone

I grew up thinking my identity was an anomaly that would die with me

People drilled this idea of otherness into my mind

and I bought it because I didn't know anyone else like me

Maybe if I had known my ancestors sooner

it wouldn't have taken me so long to find a source of pride

in my identity and in my community

Because I belong to an amazing vibrant community of people

that uplift each other even when others won't

that take care of each other even when we are struggling

that somehow despite it all

still find cause to celebrate each other

to love each other

to look one another in the eyes and say

You are not alone

You have us

And we're not going anywhere

Thank you

Applause

Ah earth's oceans

They are beautiful inspiring lifesustaining

They are also as you're probably quite aware more or less screwed

In the Seychelles for example

human activities and climate change have left corals bleached

Overfishing has caused fish stocks to plummet

Biodiversity is in peril

So what can we do

Well some form of protection obviously

Nature is very resilient

When marine areas are strategically protected

entire ecosystems can bounce back

However creating marine protected areas isn't easy

First you have the issue of figuring out where to protect

This coral reef overlaps with that international fishing route

intersects with this fish hatchery

Everything is interconnected

And marine protection plans must take into account

how one area affects another

Then there's the issue of getting everyone on board

Coastal economies often rely on fishing and tourism

If people think they can't do their work

there's no chance of getting the local buyin you need

for the area to be successful

Marine protected areas must also be enforced

That means the government itself must be deeply invested in the plan

Token support will not cut it

And finally conservation requires money

A lot of it

Governments in island and coastal nations may want to protect their waters

but often these nations have very high debt

and can't afford to prioritize conservation

If we rely on philanthropic dollars alone to fund marine protection

we might get a small marineprotected area here

another little one there

But we need more marine protected areas faster

to have lasting impact

So what exactly does smart ocean conservation look like

How do we get the money government support and careful planning

that takes into account both local economies

and complex ecosystems

We want to share with you an audacious idea

from The Nature Conservancy

It seeks to address all of these things in one fell swoop

They've realized that debt held by island and coastal nations

is the very thing that will enable them to achieve their conservation goals

TNC's idea is to restructure this debt

to generate the funds and political will

to protect reefs mangroves and fisheries

For example if you refinance your house

to take advantage of a better interest rate

maybe you use the savings to insulate your attic

That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do for entire coastal countries

Refinance the debt

then use the savings to create marine protected areas

Of course sovereign debt restructuring is more complicated than that

but you get the basic idea

If investors put in  million dollars now

it can unlock as much as  billion for ocean conservation

And this is how the work gets done

Step one negotiate the deal

A coastal nation commits to protect at least  percent of its ocean areas

In exchange The Nature Conservancy bring investors public funders

and international development organizations

to the table to restructure a portion of the nation's debt

leading to lower interest rates and longer repayment periods

Step two create a marine plan

Simultaneously The Nature Conservancy works with marine scientists

government leaders and local stakeholders

to create a detailed conservation plan

that integrates the needs of the ocean with the needs of the people

Step three activate for longevity

TNC establishes an independently run conservation trust fund

The savings from the debt restructure goes into it

to support new marine protected areas

The trust then holds the government accountable for its commitments

ensuring that the Blue Bonds finance real protection efforts

Could this plan work

It already has

In  TNC helped create a national conservation plan in the Seychelles

TNC restructured  million dollars of the government's debt

And in exchange the government agreed to protect  percent of its marine areas

Today the Seychelles is on track

to protect  square kilometers of ocean

That's an area roughly the size of Germany

The Seychelles is protecting its coral reefs

it's replenishing its fisheries

it's improving its resilience to climate change

At the same time it's strengthening its economy

This success is making other governments take note

Many want to be part of this

There's an opportunity to scale this up dramatically

And fast

TNC has identified  more nations where such a plan should be possible

But to execute they need seed capital

And to put in place local teams who can develop conservation plans

work with all the stakeholders and structure the deals

If they get the support they need over the next five years

they could protect four million square kilometers of ocean

That's  Germanies

This would increase the amount of protected areas

in all of the world's oceans

by an incredible  percent

It would allow vast tracks of the world's coral reefs to replenish

and give safe harbor to countless species

This would be truly incredible

And it's really just the beginning

Because there aren't  countries in the world

where this kind of debt conversion would work

There are almost 

With this approach everyone wins

Governments local citizens funders

and most importantly our oceans

So in fact we all win

Ah earth's oceans

The most important gift your mother and father ever gave you

was the two sets of three billion letters of DNA
DNA
that make up your genome

But like anything with three billion components

that gift is fragile

Sunlight smoking unhealthy eating

even spontaneous mistakes made by your cells

all cause changes to your genome

The most common kind of change in DNA
DNA
is the simple swap of one letter or base such as C
C
with a different letter such as T G or A
tgA
In any day the cells in your body will collectively accumulate

billions of these singleletter swaps which are also called point mutations

Now most of these point mutations are harmless

But every now and then

a point mutation disrupts an important capability in a cell

or causes a cell to misbehave in harmful ways

If that mutation were inherited from your parents

or occurred early enough in your development

then the result would be that many or all of your cells

contain this harmful mutation

And then you would be one of hundreds of millions of people

with a genetic disease

such as sickle cell anemia or progeria

or muscular dystrophy or TaySachs disease

Grievous genetic diseases caused by point mutations

are especially frustrating

because we often know the exact singleletter change

that causes the disease and in theory could cure the disease

Millions suffer from sickle cell anemia

because they have a single A to T point mutations
AT
in both copies of their hemoglobin gene

And children with progeria are born with a T
T
at a single position in their genome

where you have a C
C
with the devastating consequence that these wonderful bright kids

age very rapidly and pass away by about age 

Throughout the history of medicine

we have not had a way to efficiently correct point mutations

in living systems

to change that diseasecausing T back into a C
TC
Perhaps until now

Because my laboratory recently succeeded in developing such a capability

which we call base editing

The story of how we developed base editing

actually begins three billion years ago

We think of bacteria as sources of infection

but bacteria themselves are also prone to being infected

in particular by viruses

So about three billion years ago

bacteria evolved a defense mechanism to fight viral infection

That defense mechanism is now better known as CRISPR
CRISPR
And the warhead in CRISPR is this purple protein
CRISPR
that acts like molecular scissors to cut DNA
DNA
breaking the double helix into two pieces

If CRISPR couldn't distinguish between bacterial and viral DNA
CRISPRDNA
it wouldn't be a very useful defense system

But the most amazing feature of CRISPR
CRISPR
is that the scissors can be programmed to search for

bind to and cut

only a specific DNA sequence
DNA
So when a bacterium encounters a virus for the first time

it can store a small snippet of that virus's DNA
DNA
for use as a program to direct the CRISPR scissors
CRISPR
to cut that viral DNA sequence during a future infection
DNA
Cutting a virus's DNA messes up the function of the cut viral gene
DNA
and therefore disrupts the virus's life cycle

Remarkable researchers including Emmanuelle Charpentier George Church

Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang
Jennifer DoudnaFeng Zhang
showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors could be programmed
CRISPR
to cut DNA sequences of our choosing
DNA
including sequences in your genome

instead of the viral DNA sequences chosen by bacteria
DNA
But the outcomes are actually similar

Cutting a DNA sequence in your genome
DNA
also disrupts the function of the cut gene typically

by causing the insertion and deletion of random mixtures of DNA letters
DNA
at the cut site

Now disrupting genes can be very useful for some applications

But for most point mutations that cause genetic diseases

simply cutting the alreadymutated gene won't benefit patients

because the function of the mutated gene needs to be restored

not further disrupted

So cutting this alreadymutated hemoglobin gene

that causes sickle cell anemia

won't restore the ability of patients to make healthy red blood cells

And while we can sometimes introduce new DNA sequences into cells
DNA
to replace the DNA sequences surrounding a cut site
DNA
that process unfortunately doesn't work in most types of cells

and the disrupted gene outcomes still predominate

Like many scientists I've dreamed of a future

in which we might be able to treat or maybe even cure

human genetic diseases

But I saw the lack of a way to fix point mutations

which cause most human genetic diseases

as a major problem standing in the way

Being a chemist I began working with my students

to develop ways on performing chemistry directly on an individual DNA base
DNA
to truly fix rather than disrupt the mutations that cause genetic diseases

The results of our efforts are molecular machines

called base editors

Base editors use the programmable searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors
CRISPR
but instead of cutting the DNA
DNA
they directly convert one base to another base

without disrupting the rest of the gene

So if you think of naturally occurring CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors
CRISPR
you can think of base editors as pencils

capable of directly rewriting one DNA letter into another
DNA
by actually rearranging the atoms of one DNA base
DNA
to instead become a different base

Now base editors don't exist in nature

In fact we engineered the first base editor shown here

from three separate proteins

that don't even come from the same organism

We started by taking CRISPR scissors and disabling the ability to cut DNA
CRISPRDNA
while retaining its ability to search for and bind a target DNA sequence
DNA
in a programmed manner

To those disabled CRISPR scissors shown in blue
CRISPR
we attached a second protein in red

which performs a chemical reaction on the DNA base C
DNAC
converting it into a base that behaves like T
T
Third we had to attach to the first two proteins

the protein shown in purple

which protects the edited base from being removed by the cell

The net result is an engineered threepart protein

that for the first time allows us to convert Cs into Ts
CsTs
at specified locations in the genome

But even at this point our work was only half done

Because in order to be stable in cells

the two strands of a DNA double helix have to form base pairs
DNA
And because C only pairs with G
CG
and T only pairs with A
TA
simply changing a C to a T on one DNA strand creates a mismatch
DNACT
a disagreement between the two DNA strands
DNA
that the cell has to resolve by deciding which strand to replace

We realized that we could further engineer this threepart protein

to flag the nonedited strand as the one to be replaced

by nicking that strand

This little nick tricks the cell

into replacing the nonedited G with an A
GA
as it remakes the nicked strand

thereby completing the conversion of what used to be a CG base pair
CG
into a stable TA base pair
TA
After several years of hard work

led by a former post doc in the lab Alexis Komor
Alexis Komor
we succeeded in developing this first class of base editor

which converts Cs into Ts and Gs into As
CsTsGsAs
at targeted positions of our choosing

Among the more than  known diseaseassociated point mutations

the two kinds of mutations that this first base editor can reverse

collectively account for about  percent or  or so pathogenic point mutations

But correcting the largest fraction of diseasecausing point mutations

would require developing a second class of base editor

one that could convert As into Gs or Ts into Cs
AsGsTsCs
Led by Nicole Gaudelli a former post doc in the lab

we set out to develop this second class of base editor

which in theory could correct up to almost half of pathogenic point mutations

including that mutation that causes the rapidaging disease progeria

We realized that we could borrow once again

the targeting mechanism of CRISPR scissors
CRISPR
to bring the new base editor to the right site in a genome

But we quickly encountered an incredible problem

namely there is no protein

that's known to convert A into G or T into C
AGTC
in DNA
DNA
Faced with such a serious stumbling block

most students would probably look for another project

if not another research advisor

Laughter

But Nicole agreed to proceed with a plan

that seemed wildly ambitious at the time

Given the absence of a naturally occurring protein

that performs the necessary chemistry

we decided we would evolve our own protein in the laboratory

to convert A into a base that behaves like G
AG
starting from a protein that performs related chemistry on RNA
RNA
We set up a Darwinian survivalofthefittest selection system

that explored tens of millions of protein variants

and only allowed those rare variants

that could perform the necessary chemistry to survive

We ended up with a protein shown here

the first that can convert A in DNA
ADNA
into a base that resembles G
G
And when we attached that protein

to the disabled CRISPR scissors shown in blue
CRISPR
we produced the second base editor

which converts As into Gs
AsGs
and then uses the same strandnicking strategy

that we used in the first base editor

to trick the cell into replacing the nonedited T with a C
TC
as it remakes that nicked strand

thereby completing the conversion of an AT base pair to a GC base pair
ATGC

Thank you

As an academic scientist in the US

I'm not used to being interrupted by applause

Laughter

We developed these first two classes of base editors

only three years ago and one and a half years ago

But even in that short time

base editing has become widely used by the biomedical research community

Base editors have been sent more than  times

at the request of more than  researchers around the globe

A hundred scientific research papers have been published already

using base editors in organisms ranging from bacteria

to plants to mice to primates

While base editors are too new

to have already entered human clinical trials

scientists have succeeded in achieving a critical milestone towards that goal

by using base editors in animals

to correct point mutations that cause human genetic diseases

For example

a collaborative team of scientists led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy

two additional students in my lab

recently used a virus to deliver that second base editor

into a mouse with progeria

changing that diseasecausing T back into a C
TC
and reversing its consequences at the DNA RNA and protein levels
DNARNA
Base editors have also been used in animals

to reverse the consequence of tyrosinemia

beta thalassemia muscular dystrophy

phenylketonuria a congenital deafness

and a type of cardiovascular disease 

in each case by directly correcting a point mutation

that causes or contributes to the disease

In plants base editors have been used

to introduce individual single DNA letter changes
DNA
that could lead to better crops

And biologists have used base editors to probe the role of individual letters

in genes associated with diseases such as cancer

Two companies I cofounded Beam Therapeutics and Pairwise Plants

are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases

and to improve agriculture

All of these applications of base editing

have taken place in less than the past three years

on the historical timescale of science

the blink of an eye

Additional work lies ahead

before base editing can realize its full potential

to improve the lives of patients with genetic diseases

While many of these diseases are thought to be treatable

by correcting the underlying mutation

in even a modest fraction of cells in an organ

delivering molecular machines like base editors

into cells in a human being

can be challenging

Coopting nature's viruses to deliver base editors

instead of the molecules that give you a cold

is one of several promising delivery strategies

that's been successfully used

Continuing to develop new molecular machines

that can make all of the remaining ways

to convert one base pair to another base pair

and that minimize unwanted editing at offtarget locations in cells

is very important

And engaging with other scientists doctors ethicists and governments

to maximize the likelihood that base editing is applied thoughtfully

safely and ethically

remains a critical obligation

These challenges notwithstanding

if you had told me even just five years ago

that researchers around the globe

would be using laboratoryevolved molecular machines

to directly convert an individual base pair

to another base pair

at a specified location in the human genome

efficiently and with a minimum of other outcomes

I would have asked you

What sciencefiction novel are you reading

Thanks to a relentlessly dedicated group of students

who were creative enough to engineer what we could design ourselves

and brave enough to evolve what we couldn't

base editing has begun to transform that sciencefictionlike aspiration

into an exciting new reality

one in which the most important gift we give our children

may not only be three billion letters of DNA
DNA
but also the means to protect and repair them

Thank you

Applause

Thank you

I'd like to tell you about a patient named Donna

In this photograph Donna was in her mids

a vigorous healthy woman

the matriarch of a large clan

She had a family history of heart disease however

and one day she had the sudden onset of crushing chest pain

Now unfortunately rather than seeking medical attention

Donna took to her bed for about  hours until the pain passed

The next time she went to see her physician

he performed an electrocardiogram

and this showed that she'd had a large heart attack

or a myocardial infarction in medical parlance

After this heart attack Donna was never quite the same

Her energy levels progressively waned

she couldn't do a lot of the physical activities she'd previously enjoyed

It got to the point where she couldn't keep up with her grandkids

and it was even too much work to go out to the end of the driveway

to pick up the mail

One day her granddaughter came by to walk the dog

and she found her grandmother dead in the chair

Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia that was secondary to heart failure

But the last thing that I should tell you

is that Donna was not just an ordinary patient

Donna was my mother

Stories like ours are unfortunately far too common

Heart disease is the number one killer in the entire world

In the United States

it's the most common reason patients are admitted to the hospital

and it's our number one health care expense

We spend over a  billion dollars  billion with a B 

in this country every year

on the treatment of heart disease

Just for reference that's more than twice the annual budget

of the state of Washington

What makes this disease so deadly

Well it all starts with the fact that the heart is the least regenerative organ

in the human body

Now a heart attack happens when a blood clot forms in a coronary artery

that feeds blood to the wall of the heart

This plugs the blood flow

and the heart muscle is very metabolically active

and so it dies very quickly

within just a few hours of having its blood flow interrupted

Since the heart can't grow back new muscle

it heals by scar formation

This leaves the patient with a deficit

in the amount of heart muscle that they have

And in too many people their illness progresses to the point

where the heart can no longer keep up with the body's demand for blood flow

This imbalance between supply and demand is the crux of heart failure

So when I talk to people about this problem

I often get a shrug and a statement to the effect of

Well you know Chuck we've got to die of something

Laughter

And yeah but what this also tells me

is that we've resigned ourselves to this as the status quo because we have to

Or do we

I think there's a better way

and this better way involves the use of stem cells as medicines

So what exactly are stem cells

If you look at them under the microscope there's not much going on

They're just simple little round cells

But that belies two remarkable attributes

The first is they can divide like crazy

So I can take a single cell and in a month's time

I can grow this up to billions of cells

The second is they can differentiate or become more specialized

so these simple little round cells can turn into skin can turn into brain

can turn into kidney and so forth

Now some tissues in our bodies are chockfull of stem cells

Our bone marrow for example cranks out billions of blood cells every day

Other tissues like the heart are quite stable

and as far as we can tell the heart lacks stem cells entirely

So for the heart we're going to have to bring stem cells in from the outside

and for this we turn to the most potent stem cell type

the pluripotent stem cell

Pluripotent stem cells are so named

because they can turn into any of the some cell types

that make up the human body

So this is my big idea

I want to take human pluripotent stem cells

grow them up in large numbers

differentiate them into cardiac muscle cells

and then take them out of the dish

and transplant them into the hearts of patients who have had heart attacks

I think this is going to reseed the wall with new muscle tissue

and this will restore contractile function to the heart

Applause

Now before you applaud too much this was my idea  years ago

Laughter

And I was young I was full of it and I thought

five years in the lab and we'll crank this out

and we'll have this into the clinic

Let me tell you what really happened

Laughter

We began with the quest to turn these pluripotent stem cells into heart muscle

And our first experiments worked sort of

We got these little clumps of beating human heart muscle in the dish

and that was cool because it said in principle

this should be able to be done

But when we got around to doing the cell counts

we found that only one out of  of our stem cells

were actually turning into heart muscle

The rest was just a gemisch of brain and skin and cartilage

and intestine

So how do you coax a cell that can become anything

into becoming just a heart muscle cell

Well for this we turned to the world of embryology

For over a century the embryologists had been pondering

the mysteries of heart development

And they had given us what was essentially a Google Map

for how to go from a single fertilized egg

all the way over to a human cardiovascular system

So we shamelessly absconded all of this information

and tried to make human cardiovascular development happen in a dish

It took us about five years but nowadays

we can get  percent of our stem cells to turn into cardiac muscle 

a fold improvement

So this was quite exciting

This slide shows you our current cellular product

We grow our heart muscle cells in little threedimensional clumps

called cardiac organoids

Each of them has  to  heart muscle cells in it

If you look closely you can see these little organoids are actually twitching

each one is beating independently

But they've got another trick up their sleeve

We took a gene from jellyfish that live in the Pacific Northwest

and we used a technique called genome editing

to splice this gene into the stem cells

And this makes our heart muscle cells flash green every time they beat

OK so now we were finally ready to begin animal experiments

We took our cardiac muscle cells

and we transplanted them into the hearts of rats

that had been given experimental heart attacks

A month later I peered anxiously down through my microscope

to see what we had grown

and I saw 

nothing

Everything had died

But we persevered on this and we came up with a biochemical cocktail

that we called our prosurvival cocktail

and this was enough to allow our cells to survive

through the stressful process of transplantation

And now when I looked through the microscope

I could see this fresh young human heart muscle

growing back in the injured wall of this rat's heart

So this was getting quite exciting

The next question was

Will this new muscle beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart

So to answer that

we returned to the cells that had that jellyfish gene in them

We used these cells essentially like a space probe

that we could launch into a foreign environment

and then have that flashing report back to us

about their biological activity

What you're seeing here is a zoomedin view

a blackandwhite image of a guinea pig's heart

that was injured and then received three grafts of our human cardiac muscle

So you see those sort of diagonally running white lines

Each of those is a needle track

that contains a couple of million human cardiac muscle cells in it

And when I start the video you can see what we saw

when we looked through the microscope

Our cells are flashing

and they're flashing in synchrony

back through the walls of the injured heart

What does this mean

It means the cells are alive

they're well they're beating

and they've managed to connect with one another

so that they're beating in synchrony

But it gets even more interesting than this

If you look at that tracing that's along the bottom

that's the electrocardiogram from the guinea pig's own heart

And if you line up the flashing with the heartbeat

that's shown on the bottom

what you can see is there's a perfect onetoone correspondence

In other words the guinea pig's natural pacemaker is calling the shots

and the human heart muscle cells are following in lockstep

like good soldiers

Applause

Our current studies have moved into what I think is going to be

the best possible predictor of a human patient

and that's into macaque monkeys

This next slide shows you a microscopic image

from the heart of a macaque that was given an experimental heart attack

and then treated with a saline injection

This is essentially like a placebo treatment

to show the natural history of the disease

The macaque heart muscle is shown in red

and in blue you see the scar tissue that results from the heart attack

So as you look as this you can see how there's a big deficiency in the muscle

in part of the wall of the heart

And it's not hard to imagine how this heart would have a tough time

generating much force

Now in contrast this is one of the stemcelltreated hearts

Again you can see the monkey's heart muscle in red

but it's very hard to even see the blue scar tissue

and that's because we've been able to repopulate it

with the human heart muscle

and so we've got this nice plump wall

OK let's just take a second and recap

I've showed you that we can take our stem cells

and differentiate them into cardiac muscle

We've learned how to keep them alive after transplantation

we've showed that they beat in synchrony with the rest of the heart

and we've shown that we can scale them up

into an animal that is the best possible predictor of a human's response

You'd think that we hit all the roadblocks that lay in our path right

Turns out not

These macaque studies also taught us

that our human heart muscle cells created a period of electrical instability

They caused ventricular arrhythmias or irregular heartbeats

for several weeks after we transplanted them

This was quite unexpected because we hadn't seen this in smaller animals

We've studied it extensively

and it turns out that it results from the fact that our cellular graphs

are quite immature

and immature heart muscle cells all act like pacemakers

So what happens is we put them into the heart

and there starts to be a competition with the heart's natural pacemaker

over who gets to call the shots

It would be sort of like

if you brought a whole gaggle of teenagers into your orderly household all at once

and they don't want to follow the rules and the rhythms of the way you run things

and it takes a while to rein everybody in

and get people working in a coordinated fashion

So our plans at the moment

are to make the cells go through this troubled adolescence period

while they're still in the dish

and then we'll transplant them in in the postadolescent phase

where they should be much more orderly

and be ready to listen to their marching orders

In the meantime it turns out we can actually do quite well

by treating with antiarrhythmia drugs as well

So one big question still remains

and that is of course the whole purpose that we set out to do this

Can we actually restore function to the injured heart

To answer this question

we went to something that's called left ventricular ejection fraction

Ejection fraction is simply the amount of blood

that is squeezed out of the chamber of the heart

with each beat

Now in healthy macaques like in healthy people

ejection fractions are about  percent

After a heart attack ejection fraction drops down to about  percent

so these animals are well on their way to heart failure

In the animals that receive a placebo injection

when we scan them a month later

we see that ejection fraction is unchanged

because the heart of course doesn't spontaneously recover

But in every one of the animals that received a graft

of human cardiac muscle cells

we see a substantial improvement in cardiac function

This averaged eight points so from  to  percent

What I can tell you is that eight points is better

than anything that's on the market right now

for treating patients with heart attacks

It's better than everything we have put together

So if we could do eight points in the clinic

I think this would be a big deal that would make a large impact

on human health

But it gets more exciting

That was just four weeks after transplantation

If we extend these studies out to three months

we get a full point gain in ejection fraction

Applause

Function in these treated hearts is so good

that if we didn't know up front that these animals had had a heart attack

we would never be able to tell from their functional studies

Going forward our plan is to start phase one

first in human trials here at the University of Washington in  

two short years from now

Presuming these studies are safe and effective

which I think they're going to be

our plan is to scale this up and ship these cells all around the world

for the treatment of patients with heart disease

Given the global burden of this illness

I could easily imagine this treating a million or more patients a year

So I envision a time maybe a decade from now

where a patient like my mother will have actual treatments

that can address the root cause and not just manage her symptoms

This all comes from the fact that stem cells give us the ability

to repair the human body

from its component parts

In the nottoodistant future

repairing humans is going to go

from something that is farfetched science fiction

into common medical practice

And when this happens

it's going to have a transformational effect

that rivals the development of vaccinations and antibiotics

I'd like to introduce you to an interesting person named tzi
  tzi
He lives in Italy

at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology

because he's a mummy

This is an artist's rendition of what he might have looked like

when he was alive  years ago

You want to see what he looks like today

Laughter

OK brace yourselves gross mummy pic coming at you

So he's not as handsome as he used to be

but he's actually in great shape for a mummy

because he was discovered frozen in ice

tzi is the oldest mummy that's been discovered with preserved skin

 years is super old

older than the Egyptian pyramids

and tzi's skin is covered in  black tattoos

all lines and crosses on parts of his body

where he might have experienced pain

So scientists think that they might have been used

to mark sites for some kind of therapy

like acupuncture

So clearly if the oldest skin we've seen

is all tattooed up

tattooing is a very ancient practice

But fastforward to today and tattoos are everywhere

Almost one in four Americans has a tattoo

it's a multibilliondollar industry

and whether you love tattoos or hate them

this talk will change the way you think about them

So why are tattoos so popular

Unlike tzi most of us today use tattoos for some kind of selfexpression
  tzi
Personally I love tattoos because I love art

and there is something so wonderful to me

almost romantic about the way a tattoo as an art form

cannot be commodified

Right Your tattoo lives and dies with you
 
It can't be bought or sold or traded

so its only value is really personal to you

and I love that

Now I tend to gravitate towards really colorful tattoos

because I'm obsessed with color

I teach a whole course on it at my university

But my very first tattoo was an allblack tattoo

like tzi's
  tzi
Yep I did that clichd thing that young people do sometimes

and I got a tattoo in a language I can't even read

Laughter

OK but I was  years old

I had just returned from my first trip overseas

I was in Japan in the mountains

meditating in Buddhist monasteries

and it was a really meaningful experience to me

so I wanted to commemorate it with this Japanese and Chinese character

for mountain

Now here's what blows my mind

My yearold tattoo

and tzi's yearold tattoos

are made of the same exact stuff

soot

that black powdery carbon dust

that gets left behind in the fireplace when you burn stuff

And if you zoom way way in on either my tattoo or tzi's tattoos

you'll find that they all look something like this

A tattoo is nothing more than a bunch of tiny pigment particles

soot in this case

that get trapped in the dermis

which is the layer of tissue right underneath the surface of the skin

So in over five thousand years

we've done very little to update tattoo technology

apart from getting access to more colors

and slightly more efficient methods of installation

While I'm an artist I'm also a scientist

and I direct a laboratory that researches nanotechnology

which is the science of building things with ultratiny building blocks

thousands of times smaller even than the width of a human hair

And I began to ask myself

how could nanotechnology serve tattooing

If tattoos are just a bunch of particles in the skin

could we swap those particles out for ones that do something more interesting

Here's my big idea

I believe that tattoos can give you superpowers

Laughter

Now I don't mean they're going to make us fly

but I do think that we can have superpowers

in the sense that tattoos can give us new abilities

that we don't currently possess

By upgrading the particles we can engineer tattooing

so that it will change not only the appearance of our skin

but also the function of our skin

Let me show you

This is a diagram of a microcapsule

It's a tiny hollow particle with a protective outer shell

about the size of a tattoo pigment

and you can fill the inside with practically whatever you want

So what if we put interesting materials inside of these microcapsules

and made tattoo inks with them

What sorts of things could we make a tattoo do

What problems could we solve

What human limitations could we overcome

Well here's one idea

one of our weaknesses as humans

is that we can't see ultraviolet or UV light

That's the highenergy part of sunlight

that causes sunburn and increases our risk of skin cancer

Many animals and insects can actually see UV light but we can't

If we could we'd be able to see sunscreen when it was applied on our skin

Unfortunately most of us don't wear sunscreen

and those of us who do

can't really tell when it wears off because it's invisible

It's the main reason we treat over five million cases

of preventable skin cancer every year in the US alone

costing our economy over five billion dollars annually

So how could we overcome this human weakness with a tattoo

Well if the problem is that we can't see UV rays

maybe we can make a tattoo detect them for us

So I thought why don't we take some microcapsules

load it up with a UVsensitive colorchanging dye

and make a tattoo ink out of that

Now one of the troubles of being a tattoo technologist

is finding willing test subjects

Laughter

And when it came time to test this tattoo ink

I thought it best not to torture my poor graduate students

So I decided to tattoo a couple of spots on my own arm instead

And It actually worked Check it out

I call these tattoos solar freckles

because they're powered by sunshine

And right now they're invisible

but as soon as I expose them to a UV light acting as the Sun 

there they are blue spots

Now I'm not wearing sunscreen in this video

but if I was those blue spots would not appear

and then when my sunscreen wore off later

the solar freckles would reappear in UV light

and I would know that it was time to reapply sunscreen

So these tattoos act as a realtime nakedeye indicator

of your skin's UV exposure

And of course

I think there are lots of really cool artistic things you could do

with a colorchanging tattoo like this

but I hope that it will also help us solve a big problem

in skin protection

Applause

Let me give you another example

Normal human body temperature is about  to  degrees Fahrenheit

and if you fall outside of that range

you need to seek medical attention right away

Now the problem is that humans can't detect our own body temperature

without a thermometer

Sure you could try the old handontheforehead trick

but there's zero scientific evidence to back that up

Laughter

So what if we could create a tattooable thermometer

that you could access anytime

Well remember how the solar freckles used a UVsensitive dye

inside of the microcapsules of the tattoo ink

Well you could also put heatsensitive dyes

inside of microcapsules

and you could make different tattoo inks

that change color at different temperatures

Suppose it was   and a hundred degrees Fahrenheit

If you place those inks side by side

now you have a temperature scale

tuned to the human body

In this video you can see the different patches of tattoos

disappearing sequentially

as the pigskin we tested them on

is heated up

So if you were to place a tattoo like this

in a location that was stable to external temperature fluctuations 

maybe inside of the mouth perhaps on the back of the lip 
 
then you'd be able to read your body temperature anytime

by just glancing at your tattoo in the mirror

Amazing right

Applause

Thank you

Applause

Another limitation that we have as humans

is that our skin doesn't conduct electricity

and that can be a good thing but not necessarily 

Laughter

if you have an electronic biomedical implant

like a pacemaker for example

Right now if you have a pacemaker

you need surgery every five or  years to replace the battery when it dies

And wouldn't it be nice if instead

we could simply recharge the battery through a patch of conducting skin

Well if you were to try to tackle that problem with a tattoo

the first step would be to make a tattoo that conducts electricity

So we've been working on a conducting tattoo ink in my lab

And right now we're able to increase the conductivity of skin over fold

with our conducting tattoo ink

Now we have a long way to go before we reach the conductivity

of something like a copper wire

but we're making progress and I'm really excited about this

because I think that it could open up a whole new world of possibility

for tattoos

I envision a future where tattoos enable us 

tattooable wires and tattooable electronics enable us

to merge our technologies with our bodies

so that they feel more like extensions of ourselves

rather than external devices

So these are a few examples of the new abilities that we can gain

by using nanotechnology to upgrade our tattoos

but this really is only the beginning

I believe the sky is the limit for what we can do with hightech tattoos

In the future tattoos will not only be beautiful

they'll be functional too

Thank you

Hello

I'm not a real person

I'm actually a copy of a real person

Although I feel like a real person

It's kind of hard to explain

Hold on  I think I saw a real person  there's one

Let's bring him onstage

Hello

Applause

What you see up there is a digital human

I'm wearing an inertial motion capture suit

that's figuring what my body is doing

And I've got a single camera here that's watching my face

and feeding some machinelearning software that's taking my expressions

like Hm hm hm

and transferring it to that guy

We call him DigiDoug
Digidoug
He's actually a D character that I'm controlling live in real time

So I work in visual effects

And in visual effects

one of the hardest things to do is to create believable digital humans

that the audience accepts as real

People are just really good at recognizing other people

Go figure

So that's OK we like a challenge

Over the last  years

we've been putting humans and creatures into film

that you accept as real

If they're happy you should feel happy

And if they feel pain you should empathize with them

We're getting pretty good at it too

But it's really really difficult

Effects like these take thousands of hours

and hundreds of really talented artists

But things have changed

Over the last five years

computers and graphics cards have gotten seriously fast

And machine learning deep learning has happened

So we asked ourselves

Do you suppose we could create a photorealistic human

like we're doing for film

but where you're seeing the actual emotions and the details

of the person who's controlling the digital human

in real time

In fact that's our goal

If you were having a conversation with DigiDoug

oneonone

is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you

So that was our goal

About a year and a half ago we set off to achieve this goal

What I'm going to do now is take you basically on a little bit of a journey

to see exactly what we had to do to get where we are

We had to capture an enormous amount of data

In fact by the end of this thing

we had probably one of the largest facial data sets on the planet

Of my face

Laughter

Why me

Well I'll do just about anything for science

I mean look at me

I mean come on

We had to first figure out what my face actually looked like

Not just a photograph or a D scan

but what it actually looked like in any photograph

how light interacts with my skin

Luckily for us about three blocks away from our Los Angeles studio

is this place called ICT
ICT
They're a research lab

that's associated with the University of Southern California

They have a device there it's called the light stage

It has a zillion individually controlled lights

and a whole bunch of cameras

And with that we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions

We even captured the blood flow

and how my face changes when I make expressions

This let us build a model of my face that quite frankly is just amazing

It's got an unfortunate level of detail unfortunately

Laughter

You can see every pore every wrinkle

But we had to have that

Reality is all about detail

And without it you miss it

We are far from done though

This let us build a model of my face that looked like me

But it didn't really move like me

And that's where machine learning comes in

And machine learning needs a ton of data

So I sat down in front of some highresolution motioncapturing device

And also we did this traditional motion capture with markers

We created a whole bunch of images of my face

and moving point clouds that represented that shapes of my face

Man I made a lot of expressions

I said different lines in different emotional states 

We had to do a lot of capture with this

Once we had this enormous amount of data

we built and trained deep neural networks

And when we were finished with that

in  milliseconds

the neural network can look at my image

and figure out everything about my face

It can compute my expression my wrinkles my blood flow 

even how my eyelashes move

This is then rendered and displayed up there

with all the detail that we captured previously

We're far from done

This is very much a work in progress

This is actually the first time we've shown it outside of our company

And you know it doesn't look as convincing as we want

I've got wires coming out of the back of me

and there's a sixthofasecond delay

between when we capture the video and we display it up there

Sixth of a second  that's crazy good

But it's still why you're hearing a bit of an echo and stuff

And you know this machine learning stuff is brandnew to us

sometimes it's hard to convince to do the right thing you know

It goes a little sideways

Laughter

But why did we do this

Well there's two reasons really

First of all it is just crazy cool

Laughter

How cool is it

Well with the push of a button

I can deliver this talk as a completely different character

This is Elbor

We put him together to test how this would work

with a different appearance

And the cool thing about this technology is that while I've changed my character

the performance is still all me

I tend to talk out of the right side of my mouth

so does Elbor

Laughter

Now the second reason we did this and you can imagine

is this is going to be great for film

This is a brandnew exciting tool

for artists and directors and storytellers

It's pretty obvious right

I mean this is going to be really neat to have

But also now that we've built it

it's clear that this is going to go way beyond film

But wait

Didn't I just change my identity with the push of a button

Isn't this like deepfake and faceswapping

that you guys may have heard of

Well yeah

In fact we are using some of the same technology

that deepfake is using

Deepfake is D and image based while ours is full D
Deepfake
and way more powerful

But they're very related

And now I can hear you thinking

Darn it

I though I could at least trust and believe in video

If it was live video didn't it have to be true

Well we know that's not really the case right

Even without this there are simple tricks that you can do with video

like how you frame a shot

that can make it really misrepresent what's actually going on

And I've been working in visual effects for a long time

and I've known for a long time

that with enough effort we can fool anyone about anything

What this stuff and deepfake is doing

is making it easier and more accessible to manipulate video

just like Photoshop did for manipulating images some time ago
Photoshop
I prefer to think about

how this technology could bring humanity to other technology

and bring us all closer together

Now that you've seen this

think about the possibilities

Right off the bat you're going to see it in live events and concerts like this

Digital celebrities especially with new projection technology

are going to be just like the movies but alive and in real time

And new forms of communication are coming

You can already interact with DigiDoug in VR
VRDigidoug
And it is eyeopening

It's just like you and I are in the same room

even though we may be miles apart

Heck the next time you make a video call

you will be able to choose the version of you

you want people to see

It's like really really good makeup

I was scanned about a year and a half ago

I've aged

DigiDoug hasn't

On video calls I never have to grow old

And as you can imagine this is going to be used

to give virtual assistants a body and a face

A humanity

I already love it that when I talk to virtual assistants

they answer back in a soothing humanlike voice

Now they'll have a face

And you'll get all the nonverbal cues that make communication so much easier

It's going to be really nice

You'll be able to tell when a virtual assistant is busy or confused

or concerned about something

Now I couldn't leave the stage

without you actually being able to see my real face

so you can do some comparison

So let me take off my helmet here

Yeah don't worry it looks way worse than it feels

Laughter

So this is where we are

Let me put this back on here

Laughter

Doink

So this is where we are

We're on the cusp of being able to interact with digital humans

that are strikingly real

whether they're being controlled by a person or a machine

And like all new technology these days

it's going to come with some serious and real concerns

that we have to deal with

But I am just so really excited

about the ability to bring something that I've seen only in science fiction

for my entire life

into reality

Communicating with computers will be like talking to a friend

And talking to faraway friends

will be like sitting with them together in the same room

Thank you very much

Applause

Computers have become truly incredible

We are walking around with supercomputers in our pocket

How amazing is that

So it is disappointing

that the way we use computers the way we interact with them

hasn't really changed in the last  years

We still use a mouse and keyboards We're clicking on screens and buttons

Mobile phones are the same

We're just using fingers instead of a mouse

So is that it

Is that what the future looks like

We're going to be stuck in the screens

with our faces not seeing the world around us

That's not the future I imagine or the future I'm attracted to

What I've been always interested in is things

physical things we use every day like things on this table

that the family doesn't pay attention to

Things tell our story They tell who we are

They tell a lot about us

Let me give you an example

These are photographs of things a person touched during  hours

What can you tell about him

He loves his motorcycle Right

The biggest thing in his picture

What can you tell about this girl

She spends all her time on the beach

There's a surfboard

She lives by the sea

What can you tell about this guy

He's a chef

Look at all the ingredients he touched during the day

while he was preparing the food

and the computer is a tiny part of his life

this sad thing in the corner

So if we are using things all the time

and this is a big part of our lives

can things become the way for us to interact with our digital life

Can the world become your interface

That was my idea

I've been working for  years on it

My idea is that in order to interact in digital life

you don't need to have screens and keyboards and mouses

You can interact with your digital life

just by using the things you use every day

And to realize this idea I need to solve three big challenges

Let me tell you about them

The first one obviously Is it even possible

How can you take an everyday thing you use every day

and turn it into a computer interface

Now I was inspired by the book Hackers

I read it when I was a teenager

and one of the essential ideas of this book

is that you can change the purpose of things

by inventing new technology and then hacking into things

and changing them

So I've been thinking what kind of technology I can invent

so that I can hack into things you use every day

and make them interactive

So when I was working on this thing I invented this sensor

which injects structured electric fields into objects

and turns them into gesture interfaces

So this doorknob unmodified can become a gesture sensor

It can know how you're touching it It can feel how you're touching it

It makes a circle or can I grasp

And this doorknob isn't modified

There's nothing special about doorknobs

Anything can become interactive

What about plants

So plants are interesting because with plants

they can know where you're touching

You can see the line moving up and down on the image

And that can turn into a musical interface

Musical tones

Now we do have also practical applications

a calendar plant for those who are obsessed about practicality

Laughter

We can give things a personality

Low notes changing in pitch

So in this particular example

the orchid can communicate to you

through images and sounds

It doesn't like to be touched so it's created these electric images

that are hissing at you

This plant for example

is more robust it's a snake plant

and it likes playing with you It engages you

So every thing can be different

and every thing can represent what it feels

So everything can be hacked all the things including your body

In this example we hacked your body

so you can measure how you're folding your hands

and then using your hand gestures to control something else

so if you don't want to listen to some music thousands of times

you simply can cover your ears to turn it off

So everything can be hacked and research is important

but the second challenge we have

is how can we go from R and D and prototypes to real products

How can we make real things that are also interfaces

And you may ask yourself who would do this

Silicon Valley

Is it through Shenzhen

Now the challenge there is that the world of things is huge

Every year the apparel industry produces  billion garments

In comparison the technology industry only makes  billion phones

The world of things is much bigger than the world of technology

The technology world cannot change the world of things

Instead we need to create technology which changes makers of things

people who make your chairs and clothes and everything else

into makers of smart things

enable them to do that

So to test this challenge we came up with a very simple idea and challenge

Can a tailor make a wearable

Now we don't want to take a tailor

and turn the tailor into an electrical engineer

We still want to have some tailors around

But what we would like to do is create technology

which looks feels and behaves like a raw material used by the tailor

to make their clothes

For example a touch panel made for a tailor would look like this

made out of textiles so you can cut it with scissors and sew it in

At the same time it has to retain the performance

The way to make this textile touch panel

also requires a very different approach than for making consumer electronics

In our case we have to go to the mountains of Tokyo

to a small factory which was making kimono garments for generations

We worked with my collaborators

who were not engineers

It was an artisan who knows how to make things

and an artist who knows how to make things beautiful

Working with them we created one of the best yarns in the world

which consists of thin metallic alloys

wrapped around with polyester fibers and cotton fibers

These yarns were made in the same machines

which were making yarns for kimonos for generations

We then took these yarns and gave them to the factory

which is making textiles

and we wove our smart textile using regular machines

in a variety of colors and materials

and we gave those textiles to a tailor

in Savile Row in London

So tailors are traditionalists particularly in Savile Row

They don't use computers

They don't use machines

They use hands and they cut

They fit their products on the human body

not on D avatars
D
Technology is not a part of their vocabulary

but they are modern people

They know how to use technology

So if technology can be formed and shaped

like a button like a textile like something they can use

they absolutely can make a wearable

a garment which can place a phone call

Phone rings

So now we've proven that you can actually make a wearable

not by an electronic company but by a tailor

We worked and collaborated with Levi's
Levi's
our partners and our neighbors

to make a real product

and this product is this jacket I'm wearing right now

You can buy it It's on sale

It was made in the same factories which make all their products

and you have noticed

I've been controlling my presentation from the sleeve of the jacket

I go like this it goes forward Like this it goes backward

And of course I can do more things

It's not just to control a presentation

I can now control my navigation control my music

but most importantly it stays a jacket it stays a thing

which makes me look great

Laughter

Applause

And that's the most important thing

Laughter

So OK we proved we can turn things into interfaces

We proved that these things can be made by makers of things

and not by technology companies

I look awesome Are we done

Laughter

Not yet

The third challenge

How can we scale

How can we go from one product to many products

And that's what we're working on right now

Let me tell you how we're going to do this

First of all I want to make myself clear 

I am not talking about the Internet of Things

I'm not talking about creating another gadget

you get bored with and throw in the back of your drawer

and forget about

I am talking about the foundational important principle which guides my work

Technology has to make existing things better

It makes them better by connecting them to your digital life

and adds new usefulness and new functionality

while remaining the same original purpose

not changing it

This jacket I am wearing can control my mobile phone and presentation

but it still remains a jacket

That means that once we start making all things interactive and connected

every thing would have its own set of actuators displays and sensors

specific for those things

A pair of running shoes does not need to have a touch sensor

Why would it have one

If you have a sensor

it should measure your running performance

or knee impact

while remaining a great pair of shoes

Makers of things will have to start thinking

what kind of digital functionality they have to offer to their consumers

They will have to become service providers

or they may become irrelevant

We will have to provide and create a service ecosystem

just like we've done for mobile phones

where you have apps and services and everything else

and sometimes you're still making a phone call

Now to make this ecosystem possible we have to avoid fragmentation

We have to avoid different interfaces for different people for different things

We have to create uniform user experience

and for that reason we have to create a single computing platform

which powers all those things

What is the platform going to be

And I think the answer is obvious

it's a cloud cloud computing

Now you cannot connect things directly to the cloud obviously

So you have to develop a small device which can be plugged into all the things

and make them connected to the cloud

to unlock their potential and add new functionality

So let me show for the first time the real device which we've built

We are showing this for the first time

That's what it looks like

and it's a small device

which will be connected to things we want to make smart

and connected and interactive

How is it going to work

So on the back you have a few electrodes

So when you plug them into different things

like here

the device will recognize where you're plugging them

and then reconfigure itself to enable specific functionality

for this particular thing

We would like to give this device to makers of things

the people who make your clothing and furniture

so they can use it just like they use a button or a zipper

And what they're going to make with them is up to them

We don't want to dictate the use cases

We would like to let people who make those things 

artists and designers brands and craftsmen 

to imagine and create this new world

where things are connected

and have all this new exciting digital functionality

We don't need keyboards and screens and mouses to interact with your computer

So I've been working on this idea for  years

and now it's taking shape

and as it's taking shape what we are realizing

is that I always thought I was working on computer interfaces

I always thought of myself as an interaction designer

but I'm realizing that I'm not building interfaces

What I realized is that me and my team

we're building a new kind of computer

an ambient computer
An ambient computer
Thank you

Applause

So on the day after the Brexit vote

in June 

when Britain woke up to the shock

of discovering that we're leaving the European Union

my editor at the Observer newspaper in the UK

asked me to go back to South Wales where I grew up and to write a report

And so I went to a town called Ebbw Vale
Ebw Vale
Here it is

It's in the South Wales Valleys which is this quite special place

So it's had this very sort of rich workingclass culture

and it's famous for its Welsh male voice choirs and rugby and its coal

But when I was a teenager the coal mines and the steelworks closed

and the entire area was devastated

And I went there because it had one of the highest Leave votes in the country

Sixtytwo percent of the people here voted to leave the European Union

And I wanted to know why

When I got there I was just a bit taken aback

because the last time I went to Ebbw Vale
Ebbw
it looked like this

And now it looks like this

This is a new millionpound college of further education

that was mostly funded by the European Union

And this is the new sports center

that's at the middle of millionpound regeneration project

that's being funded by the European Union

And this is the new millionpound roadimprovement scheme

and there's a new train line a new railway station

and they're all being funded by the European Union

And it's not as if any of this is a secret

because there's big signs like this everywhere

[EU Funds Investing in Wales]
[]
Laughter

I had this sort of weird sense of unreality

walking around the town

And it came to a head

when I met this young man in front of the sports center

And he told me that he had voted to leave

because the European Union had done nothing for him

He was fed up with it

And all around town people told me the same thing

They said that they wanted to take back control

which was one of the slogans in the campaign

And they told me that they were most fed up

with the immigrants and with the refugees

They'd had enough

Which was odd

Because walking around I didn't meet any immigrants or refugees

I met one Polish woman who told me

she was practically the only foreigner in town

And when I checked the figures

I discovered that Ebbw Vale actually has
Ebbw
one of the lowest rates of immigration in the country

And so I was just a bit baffled

because I couldn't really understand

where people were getting their information from

Because it was the rightwing tabloid newspapers

which printed all these stories about immigration

And this is a very much leftwing Labour stronghold

But then after the article came out this woman got in touch with me

And she was from Ebbw Vale
Ebw Vale
and she told me about all this stuff that she'd seen on Facebook
Facebook
I was like What stuff

And she said it was all this quite scary stuff about immigration

and especially about Turkey

So I tried to find it

But there was nothing there

Because there's no archive of ads that people had seen

or what had been pushed into their news feeds

No trace of anything gone completely dark

And this referendum that will have this profound effect forever on Britain 

it's already had a profound effect

the Japanese car manufacturers that came to Wales and the north east

to replace the mining jobs 

they are already going because of Brexit

And this entire referendum took place in darkness

because it took place on Facebook
Facebook
And what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook
FacebookFacebook
because only you see your news feed and then it vanishes

so it's impossible to research anything

So we have no idea who saw what ads

or what impact they had

or what data was used to target these people

Or even who placed the ads or how much money was spent

or even what nationality they were

But Facebook does
Facebook
Facebook has these answers
Facebook
and it's refused to give them to us

Our parliament has asked Mark Zuckerberg multiple times to come to Britain

and to give us these answers

And every single time he's refused

And you have to wonder why

Because what I and other journalists have uncovered

is that multiple crimes took place during the referendum

And they took place on Facebook
Facebook
It's because in Britain we limit the amount of money

that you can spend in an election

And it's because in the th century

people would walk around with literally wheelbarrows of cash

and just buy voters

So we passed these strict laws to stop that from happening

But those laws don't work anymore

This referendum took place almost entirely online

And you can spend any amount of money on Facebook or on Google or on YouTube ads
FacebookYouTube
and nobody will know because they're black boxes

And this is what happened

We've actually got no idea of the full extent of it

But we do know that in the last days before the Brexit vote

the official Vote Leave campaign

laundered nearly three quarters of a million pounds

through another campaign entity

that our electoral commission has ruled was illegal

and it's referred it to the police

And with this illegal cash

Vote Leave unleashed a fire hose of disinformation

Ads like this

[Turkey's m people joining the EU]
[]
This is a lie it's a total lie

Turkey is not joining the European Union

There's not even any discussions of it joining the European Union

And most of us we never saw these ads

because we were not the target of them

Vote Leave identified a tiny sliver of people

who it identified as persuadable and they saw them

And the only reason we are seeing these now

is because parliament forced Facebook to hand them over
Facebook
And maybe you think

Well it was just a bit of overspending

It's a few lies

But this was the biggest electoral fraud in Britain for  years

In a onceinageneration vote

that hinged upon just one percent of the electorate

And it was just one of the crimes that took place in the referendum

There was another group

which was headed by this man Nigel Farage

the one to the right of Trump

And his group LeaveEU  it also broke the law

It broke British electoral laws and British data laws

and it's also being referred to the police

And this man Arron Banks he funded this campaign
Arron Banks
And in a completely separate case

he's being referred to our National Crime Agency

our equivalent of the FBI

because our electoral commission

has concluded they don't know where his money came from

Or if it was even British

And I'm not even going to go into the lies that Arron Banks has told

about his covert relationship with the Russian government

Or the weird timing of Nigel Farage's meetings with Julian Assange

and with Trump's buddy Roger Stone now indicted
Roger Stone
immediately before two massive WikiLeaks dumps

both of which happened to benefit Donald Trump
Donald Trump
But I will tell you that Brexit and Trump were intimately entwined

This man told me that Brexit was the petri dish for Trump

And we know it's the same people the same companies

the same data the same techniques

the same use of hate and fear

This is what they were posting on Facebook
Facebook
And I don't even want to call this a lie

[Immigration without assimilation equals invasion]
[]
because it feels more like a hate crime to me

I don't have to tell you

that hate and fear are being sown online all across the world

Not just in Britain and America but in France and in Hungary

and Brazil and Myanmar and New Zealand

And we know there is this dark undertow which is connecting us all globally

And it is flowing via the technology platforms

But we only see a tiny amount of what's going on on the surface

And I only found out anything about this dark underbelly

because I started looking into Trump's relationship to Farage

into a company called Cambridge Analytica

And I spent months tracking down an exemployee Christopher Wiley

And he told me how this company that worked for both Trump and Brexit

had profiled people politically

in order to understand their individual fears

to better target them with Facebook ads
Facebook
And it did this by illicitly harvesting the profiles

of  million people from Facebook
Facebook
It took an entire year's work to get Christopher on the record

And I had to turn myself from a feature writer

into an investigative reporter to do it

And he was extraordinarily brave

because the company is owned by Robert Mercer

the billionaire who bankrolled Trump

and he threatened to sue us multiple times

to stop us from publishing

But we finally got there and we were one day ahead of publication

We got another legal threat

Not from Cambridge Analytica this time

but from Facebook
Facebook
It told us that if we publish they would sue us

We did it anyway

Applause

Facebook you were on the wrong side of history in that

And you were on the wrong side of history in this 

in refusing to give us the answers that we need

And that is why I am here

To address you directly the gods of Silicon Valley

Applause

Mark Zuckerberg 
  
Applause

and Sheryl Sandberg and Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Jack Dorsey

and your employees and your investors too

Because  years ago

the biggest danger in the South Wales coal mines was gas

Silent and deadly and invisible

It's why they sent the canaries down first to check the air

And in this massive global online experiment that we are all living through

we in Britain are the canary

We are what happens to a western democracy

when a hundred years of electoral laws are disrupted by technology

Our democracy is broken our laws don't work anymore

and it's not me saying this

it's our parliament published a report saying this

This technology that you have invented has been amazing

But now it's a crime scene

And you have the evidence

And it is not enough to say that you will do better in the future

Because to have any hope of stopping this from happening again

we have to know the truth

And maybe you think Well it was just a few ads

And people are smarter than that right

To which I would say Good luck with that

Because what the Brexit vote demonstrates

is that liberal democracy is broken

And you broke it

This is not democracy 

spreading lies in darkness paid for with illegal cash

from God knows where

It's subversion

and you are accessories to it

Applause

Our parliament has been the first in the world

to try to hold you to account

and it's failed

You are literally beyond the reach of British law  not just British laws

this is nine parliaments nine countries are represented here

who Mark Zuckerberg refused to come and give evidence to

And what you don't seem to understand is that this is bigger than you

And it's bigger than any of us

And it is not about left or right or Leave or Remain or Trump or not

It's about whether it's actually possible

to have a free and fair election ever again

Because as it stands I don't think it is

And so my question to you is is this what you want

Is this how you want history to remember you

as the handmaidens to authoritarianism

that is on the rise all across the world

Because you set out to connect people

And you are refusing to acknowledge

that the same technology is now driving us apart

And my question to everybody else is

is this what we want

to let them get away with it

and to sit back and play with our phones as this darkness falls

The history of the South Wales Valleys is of a fight for rights

And this is not a drill  it's a point of inflection

Democracy is not guaranteed and it is not inevitable

and we have to fight and we have to win

and we cannot let these tech companies have this unchecked power

It's up to us  you me and all of us

We are the ones who have to take back control

So I have a pretty fun job

which is to figure out what makes people happy

It's so fun it might almost seen a little frivolous

especially at a time where we're being confronted

with some pretty depressing headlines

But it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key

to solving some of the toughest problems we're facing

It's taken me almost a decade to figure this out

Pretty early on in my career

I published a paper in Science with my collaborators

entitled Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness

I was very confident in this conclusion

except for one thing

it didn't seem to apply to me

Laughter

I hardly ever gave money to charity

and when I did

I didn't feel that warm glow I was expecting

So I started to wonder if maybe there was something wrong with my research

or something wrong with me

My own lackluster emotional response to giving was especially puzzling

because my followup studies revealed that even toddlers exhibited joy

from giving to others

In one experiment my colleagues Kiley Hamlin Lara Aknin and I
Kiley HamlinLara Akin
brought kids just under the age of two into the lab

Now as you might imagine

we had to work with a resource that toddlers really care about

so we used the toddler equivalent of gold

namely Goldfish crackers

Laughter

We gave kids this windfall of Goldfish for themselves

and a chance to give some of their Goldfish away

to a puppet named Monkey

Video Researcher I found even more treats

and I'm going to give them all to you

Toddler Ooh Thank you

Researcher But you know I don't see any more treats

Will you give one to Monkey

Toddler Yeah Researcher Yeah

Toddler Yeah

Here

Researcher Ooh yummy Mmmm
 mm
Toddler All gone he ate it

Elizabeth Dunn Now we trained research assistants to watch these videos

and code toddlers' emotional reactions

Of course we didn't tell them our hypotheses

The data revealed that toddlers were pretty happy

when they got this pile of Goldfish for themselves

but they were actually even happier

when they got to give some of their Goldfish away

And this warm glow of giving persists into adulthood

When we analyzed surveys from more than  adults

across the globe

we saw that nearly a third of the world's population

reported giving at least some money to charity in the past month

Remarkably in every major region of the world

people who gave money to charity were happier than those who did not

even after taking into account their own personal financial situation

And this correlation wasn't trivial

It looked like giving to charity

made about the same difference for happiness

as having twice as much income

Now as a researcher

if you're lucky enough to stumble on an effect

that replicates around the world in children and adults alike

you start to wonder

Could this be part of human nature

We know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors

like eating and sex

that help perpetuate our species

and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors

I was really excited about these ideas

and I wrote about them in the New York Times

One of the people who read this article

was my accountant

Laughter

Yeah

At tax time I found myself seated across from him

watching as he slowly tapped his pen

on the charitable giving line of my tax return

with this look of like

poorly concealed disapproval

Laughter

Despite building my career by showing how great giving can feel

I actually wasn't doing very much of it

So I resolved to give more

Around that time

devastating stories about the Syrian refugee crisis

were everywhere

I really wanted to help

so I pulled out my credit card

I knew my donations would probably make a difference for someone somewhere

but going to the website of an effective charity

and entering my Visa number

still just didn't feel like enough

That's when I learned about the Group of Five

The Canadian government allows any five Canadians

to privately sponsor a family of refugees

You have to raise enough money to support the family

for their first year in Canada

and then they literally get on a plane to your city

One of the things that I think is so cool about this program

is that no one is allowed to do it alone

And instead of a Group of Five

we ended up partnering with a community organization

and forming a group of 

After almost two years of paperwork and waiting

we learned that our family would be arriving in Vancouver

in less than six weeks

They had four sons and a daughter

so we raced to find them a place to live

We were very lucky to find them a house

but it needed quite a bit of work

So my friends came out on evenings and weekends

and painted and cleaned and assembled furniture

When the big day came

we filled their fridge with milk and fresh fruit

and headed to the airport to meet our family

It was a little overwhelming for everyone

especially the fouryearold

His mother was reunited with her sister

who had come to Canada earlier through the same program

They hadn't seen each other in  years

When you hear that more than  million refugees have fled Syria

you're faced with this tragedy

that the human brain hasn't really evolved to comprehend

It's so abstract

Before if any of us had been asked to donate  hours a month

to help out with the refugee crisis

we probably would have said no

But as soon as we took our family to their new home in Vancouver

we all had the same realization

we were just going to do whatever it took to help them be happy

This experience made me think a little more deeply about my research

Back in my lab

we'd seen the benefits of giving spike

when people felt a real sense of connection with those they were helping

and could easily envision the difference they were making

in those individuals' lives

For example in one experiment

we gave participants an opportunity to donate a bit of money

to either UNICEF or Spread the Net

We chose these charities intentionally

because they were partners and shared the same critically important goal

of promoting children's health

But I think UNICEF is just such a big broad charity

that it can be a little hard to envision

how your own small donation will make a difference

In contrast Spread the Net offers donors a concrete promise

for every  dollars donated

they provide one bed net to protect a child from malaria

We saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net

the happier they reported feeling afterward

In contrast this emotional return on investment

was completely eliminated when people gave money to UNICEF

So this suggests that just giving money to a worthwhile charity

isn't always enough

You need to be able to envision

how exactly your dollars are going to make a difference

Of course the Group of Five program takes this idea to a whole new level

When we first took on this project

we would talk about when the refugees would arrive

Now we just refer to them as our family

Recently we took the kids ice skating

and later that day my sixyearold Oliver asked me

Mommy who is the oldest kid in our family

I assumed he was talking about his plethora of cousins

and he was talking about them

but also about our Syrian family

Since our family arrived

so many people and organizations have offered to help

providing everything from free dental fillings

to summer camps

It's made me see the goodness that exists in our community

Thanks to one donation

the kids got to go to bike camp

and every day of the week

some member of our group tried to be there to cheer for them

I happened to be there

the day the training wheels were supposed to come off

and let me tell you the fouryearold did not think this was a good idea

So I went over and talked to him

about the longterm benefits of riding without training wheels

Laughter

Then I remembered that he was four and barely spoke English

So I reverted to two words he definitely knew

ice cream

You try without training wheels I'll buy you ice cream

Here's what happened next

Video ED Yes Yeah
ED
Kid I'm gonna try

ED Oh my God Look at you go
 
Squealing Look at you go You're doing it all by yourself
 
Audience Laughter

Video ED Good job
ED
Audience Laughter

Applause

ED So this is the kind of helping that human beings evolved to enjoy

but for  years

Canada was the only country in the world

that allowed private citizens to sponsor refugees

Now  Canada

Applause

It's pretty great

Now Australia and the UK are starting up similar programs

Just imagine how different the refugee crisis could look

if more countries made this possible

Creating these kinds of meaningful connections between individuals

provides an opportunity to deal with challenges

that feel overwhelming

One of those challenges lies just blocks from where I'm standing right now

in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver

By some measures it's the poorest urban postal code in Canada

We actually debated whether to bring over a family of refugees

because there are so many people right here already struggling

My friend Evan told me that when he was a kid

and his parents drove through this neighborhood

he would duck down in the back seat

But Evan's parents never would have guessed

that when he grew up

he would open up the doors of a local restaurant

and invite this community inside to enjoy threecourse dinners

The program that Evan helped build is called Plenty of Plates

and the goal is not just to provide free meals

but to create moments of connection

between people who otherwise might never make eye contact

Each night a local business sponsors the dinner

and sends a team of volunteers

who help make and serve the meal

Afterward the leftovers get distributed to people who are out on the street

and importantly there's enough money left

to provide a thousand free lunches for this community

in the days that follow

But the benefits of this program extend beyond food

For the volunteers it provides an opportunity to engage with people

to sit down and hear their stories

After this experience one volunteer changed his commute

so that instead of avoiding this neighborhood

he walks through it

smiling or making eye contact as he passes familiar faces

All of us are capable of finding joy in giving

But we shouldn't expect this to happen automatically

Spending money helping others doesn't necessarily promote happiness

Instead it matters how we do it

And if we want people to give more

we need to subvert the way we think about charitable giving

We need to create opportunities to give

that enable us to appreciate our shared humanity

If any of you work for a charity

don't reward your donors with pens or calendars

Applause

Reward them with the opportunity

to see the specific impact that their generosity is having

and to connect with the individuals and communities they're helping

We're used to thinking about giving as something we should do

And it is

But in thinking about it this way

we're missing out on one of the best parts of being human

that we have evolved to find joy in helping others

Let's stop thinking about giving as just this moral obligation

and start thinking of it as a source of pleasure

Thank you

Applause

Ever since computers were invented

we've been trying to make them smarter and more powerful

From the abacus to roomsized machines

to desktops to computers in our pockets

And are now designing artificial intelligence to automate tasks

that would require human intelligence

If you look at the history of computing

we've always treated computers as external devices

that compute and act on our behalf

What I want to do is I want to weave computing AI and internet as part of us
AI
As part of human cognition

freeing us to interact with the world around us

Integrate human and machine intelligence

right inside our own bodies to augment us instead of diminishing us or replacing us

Could we combine what people do best such as creative and intuitive thinking

with what computers do best

such as processing information and perfectly memorizing stuff

Could this whole be better than the sum of its parts

We have a device that could make that possible

It's called AlterEgo and it's a wearable device
Alternego
that gives you the experience of a conversational AI

that lives inside your head

that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself internally

We have a new prototype that we're showing here

for the first time at TED and here's how it works
TED
Normally when we speak

the brain sends neurosignals through the nerves

to your internal speech systems

to activate them and your vocal cords to produce speech

One of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks

that we do as human beings

Now imagine talking to yourself

without vocalizing without moving your mouth

without moving your jaw

but by simply articulating those words internally

Thereby very subtly engaging your internal speech systems

such as your tongue and back of your palate

When that happens

the brain sends extremely weak signals to these internal speech systems

AlterEgo has sensors
Alternego
embedded in a thin plastic flexible and transparent device

that sits on your neck just like a sticker

These sensors pick up on these internal signals

sourced deep within the mouth cavity

right from the surface of the skin

An AI program running in the background

then tries to figure out what the user's trying to say

It then feeds back an answer to the user

by means of bone conduction

audio conducted through the skull into the user's inner ear

that the user hears

overlaid on top of the user's natural hearing of the environment

without blocking it

The combination of all these parts the input the output and the AI
AI
gives a net subjective experience of an interface inside your head

that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself

Just to be very clear the device does not record or read your thoughts

It records deliberate information that you want to communicate

through deliberate engagement of your internal speech systems

People don't want to be read they want to write

Which is why we designed the system

to deliberately record from the peripheral nervous system

Which is why the control in all situations resides with the user

I want to stop here for a second and show you a live demo

What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Eric a question

And he's going to search for that information

without vocalizing without typing without moving his fingers

without moving his mouth

Simply by internally asking that question

The AI will then figure out the answer and feed it back to Eric

through audio through the device

While you see a laptop in front of him he's not using it

Everything lives on the device

All he needs is that sticker device to interface with the AI and the internet

So Eric what's the weather in Vancouver like right now

What you see on the screen

are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now

This is happening in real time

Eric It's  degrees and rainy here in Vancouver

Arnav Kapur What happened is that the AI sent the answer
Arnav Kapur
through audio through the device back to Eric

What could the implications of something like this be

Imagine perfectly memorizing things

where you perfectly record information that you silently speak

and then hear them later when you want to

internally searching for information

crunching numbers at speeds computers do

silently texting other people

Suddenly becoming multilingual

so that you internally speak in one language

and hear the translation in your head in another

The potential could be farreaching

There are millions of people around the world

who struggle with using natural speech

People with conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease
ALSLou Gehrig
stroke and oral cancer

amongst many other conditions

For them communicating is a painstakingly slow and tiring process

This is Doug

Doug was diagnosed with ALS about  years ago
ALS
and has since lost the ability to speak

Today he uses an onscreen keyboard

where he types in individual letters using his head movements

And it takes several minutes to communicate a single sentence

So we went to Doug and asked him

what were the first words he'd like to use or say using our system

Perhaps a greeting like Hello how are you

Or indicate that he needed help with something

What Doug said that he wanted to use our system for

is to reboot the old system he had because that old system kept on crashing

Laughter

We never could have predicted that

I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug using our system for the first time

Voice Reboot computer

AK What you just saw there
AK
was Doug communicating or speaking in real time for the first time

since he lost the ability to speak

There are millions of people

who might be able to communicate in real time like Doug

with other people with their friends and with their families

My hope is to be able to help them express their thoughts and ideas

I believe computing AI and the internet

would disappear into us as extensions of our cognition

instead of being external entities or adversaries

amplifying human ingenuity

giving us unimaginable abilities and unlocking our true potential

And perhaps even freeing us to becoming better at being human

Thank you so much

Applause

Shoham Arad Come over here

OK

I want to ask you a couple of questions they're going to clear the stage

I feel like this is amazing it's innovative

it's creepy it's terrifying

Can you tell us what I think 

I think there are some uncomfortable feelings around this

Tell us is this reading your thoughts

will it in five years

is there a weaponized version of this what does it look like

AK So our first design principle before we started working on this
AK
was to not render ethics as an afterthought

So we wanted to bake ethics right into the design

We flipped the design

Instead of reading from the brain directly

we're reading from the voluntary nervous system

that you deliberately have to engage to communicate with the device

while still bringing the benefits of a thinking or a thought device

The best of both worlds in a way

SA OK I think people are going to have a lot more questions for you

Also you said that it's a sticker

So right now it sits just right here

Is that the final iteration

what the final design you hope looks like

AK Our goal is for the technology to disappear completely
AK
SA What does that mean

AK If you're wearing it I shouldn't be able to see it
AK
You don't want technology on your face you want it in the background

to augment you in the background

So we have a sticker version that conforms to the skin

that looks like the skin

but we're trying to make an even smaller version

that would sit right here

SA OK
SA
I feel like if anyone has any questions they want to ask Arnav

he'll be here all week

OK thank you so much Arnav

AK Thanks Shoham

So for the first time in America's modern history

we have five generations interacting at work

The veterans born between  and 

are known as the Greatest Generation the matures the silents

They're known for their selfsacrifice

respect for authority and work as its own reward

The boomers came shortly after born between  and 

This is a generation characterized by hard work

In fact we can thank this generation for the term workaholic

They appreciate competition they love effective communication

And they're thinking towards retirement if they haven't retired already

Generation X is known as the lost generation
X
the latchkey generation born between  and 
Latchkey
This is the smallest generation

sandwiched between boomers and the big millennials

More parents were divorced in this generation

than any generation prior

They also were the first generation to tell us about worklife balance

and the first to really ask for that in the workplace

And then millennials  you know the everybodygetsaribbon generation 

born between  and 

Never knew a time where technology wasn't present in the home

They're incredibly pragmatic they're hopeful and they're determined

They think they're going to change the world

in fact I believe they're going to do it

They might be a little bit idealistic sometimes

but in just the last several years

we've seen millennials overtake Generation X
X
to be the most represented generation in the workforce

In fact more than one in three people in the United States labor force

is a millennial

And soon to join us there Generation Z born since 
Z
our high school interns or soon to be high school graduates

Now if you open any internet browser

look at Amazon

search any of your favorite search engines

you might assume there's a literal war in the workplace right

We see blog topics like

Seventeen reasons why millennials are the worst generation

And Why baby boomers have ruined it for everybody

Or Bridging the great generational divide

It's like turning into this West Side Story

like boomers come in one door

millennials come in another door the lobby

they just fight with each other all day complain go home do the same

come back to work right

Well so what if I told you these generations may not exist

I've been spending some time thinking about this and researching this

and fellow researchers and I aren't exactly sure

that these generations are real

And in fact if we can agree that these groups even exist

we certainly don't agree who belongs in them

And they span something like  years

So at whatever point in history

a oneyearold and a yearold are said to share the same value system

to want the same things at work

to have the same stereotypes working for and against them

And in fact different areas of the world define these generations differently

So we can't even compare generations across various areas of the world

And these stereotypes about each generation

have in a lot of ways created this selffulfilling prophecy

that people begin to act as if they're part of that generation

because we've said out loud that generation is real

I'm not so sure that it is

And in fact this idea of generations

has become deeply embedded in United States culture

When we talk generations

people know exactly what we're talking about

In fact people have a lot of thoughts and feelings

about each of these generations

And I'll tell you how I know this

I did the thing

that every redblooded American and pretenure academic does

when they have a question

I Googled some stuff

And this is what I learned

Google is based on algorithms

and they provide you with commonly searched terms

or suggested hits based on what other people are searching

surrounding the same topic

And it gave me a really good sense of what people think

about each of these generations

Take a look

I learned that baby boomers are conservative

that Americans think they're stupid

The worst generation they're angry

apparently they're racist and they're so important

Looking at Generation X
X
I learned Generation X is a cynical group
X
they're angry

they're known as the lost generation  we know this

they're the smallest generation

Apparently they're stupid too

Laughter

And mostly they're frustrated with baby boomers

Alright millennials this is what I learned about us

So we're obsessed with food

Laughter

We're also stupid ah

We're lazy we're sensitive we're fired

we're also hated and we think we're important

And perhaps the most terrifying search result on the internet 

Generation Z is screwed
Z
Laughter

OK so for five years I've been talking to leaders and followers

across a wide variety of organizations

And this is what I've come to realize

Generations haven't become part of the conversation 

generations have become the conversation at work

What I've learned

is that we're working under the assumption that those Google results are true

And so what I think is that organizations are now desperate

to figure out how to manage the multigenerational workplace

Manage it

We manage all sorts of things

We're preparing for this wave of millennials to come to work

So we prepare for hurricanes right

We prepare to take the MCAT we prepare for natural disasters
MCAT
Why are we preparing for yearolds to come to work

Laughter

I've talked to these organizations

and I've heard amazing things that they're doing

to create a workspace for everybody to get along

and to have autonomy and to feel like they're thriving

But I've also heard some really incredibly harebrained ideas

about how to navigate the multigenerational workplace

Are you ready

This is what I saw

I visited an organization

and they adopted this idea that if you can see it you can be it

A really important concept

But I think they blew it

The put pictures on the walls of the ideal multigenerational workplace

because if you can see it you can be it

Laughter

Or like this one

Laughter

Like I don't even want to work here

Laughter

You don't get to wear color here apparently

and HR seriously has problems with people jumping in heels

I promise you that OK

I talked to an organization who recently decided

against putting a ball pit in the break room

because that's how you retain millennials

We're  not three

Laughter

And in fact I know a young at the time millennial

who was told that if she wanted people to take her seriously

just because she was a millennial she would have to do this 

wear shoulder pads

Yes

People younger than her and older than her wouldn't take her seriously

unless she wore shoulder pads

Straightoutofthes

can'tevenbuythemanywhere shoulder pads

This young woman had two graduate degrees

This young woman was me

And this is the best we came up with

How to navigate the multigenerational workplace  is shoulder pads

Laughter

So this is also what I've learned talking to organizations

that employ a wide range of people of various ages

We are so much more similar than we are different

And we're hearing this consistently

People want work that matters they want flexibility

they want support they want appreciation

they want better coffee

But none of these things are tied to a generation

Now sure we see small differences in what people want

We know yearolds and yearolds go home and do different things

They have different values

At least when it comes to things happening outside of work

But I think what's happened

is that this focus on generational cohorts

these groups of people

has created a space where we just forgot that people are people

And to know who they really are who we really work with

we have to figure out how to better navigate

this multigenerational workplace

than ball pits

Call me one of those idealist millennials but I think we can get there

And I don't think the idea is too terribly difficult

What if we radically simply not easily

meet people where they are

Individualize our approach

I've never met a generation

I've had a lot of conversations

with people who happened to identify with a specific generational cohort

I know that yearolds text message

and yearolds crochet blankets

None of these things are stereotypical of that generation right

Nilofer Merchant  she's a thought leader in innovation 
Nilofer Merchant
she tells us we have to meet people in their onlyness

that is that spot in the world where only we stand

as a function of our unique history our experiences and our hopes

But this requires flexibility and curiosity

And what happens when we meet people in their onlyness

only the spot in the world that they stand

we learn that that boomer who is just acting angry at work all the time

is scared

Because he's worked every day since he was  years old

and on a Monday sooner than he can imagine

he'll never go to work again

He's got plans

It's going to take like a week and a half

to do all the things on that retirement list

But then what

What if we give a little bit of grace

to the person that might be a little scared

Or that Generation Xer
Xer
who has four dropoffs three kids two hands

and is just trying to keep the wheels on the bus

Sure maybe she's a little aloof at work

Maybe she's a little independent maybe she's exhausted

Or that millennial

who asks for a raise after two months because they're entitled

Well maybe it's because that generation has more debt

than any generation before them coming out of college

and they just need the money

to keep going to pay rent

And suddenly when you meet people in their onlyness

that spot in the world only they stand

we're not talking about a generation anymore

We're talking about Jim or Jen or Candice

And so here's my challenge to us

Pick a person just one and explore their onlyness

And then learn

And then in the moments where it's appropriate teach

And figure out what they bring to work that no one else can bring to work

because that's what makes work richer

And then do it again

And do it again

And then some day we're not working with generations anymore

We're working with people

And so to really understand the beauty of the multigenerational workplace

I think we just have to meet people where they are

And that doesn't require that we unpack and live there with them

But we might find at least on occasion it's a beautiful place to visit

And so I think there's just no need

to argue about which generation is the most angry

or the most entitled or the most so obsessed with food

We all come to the classroom to work back to our homes

a little bit tired and a little bit tattered sometimes

Maybe let's just do our best to humbly meet people where they are

how they show up that day

generation and all

And in those moments

where it can feel a little bit like intergenerational warfare

I think we can at least all agree

that shoulder pads aren't the solution

Laughter

Thank you

Applause

How y'all doing

Good

I came here to give you a science lesson

about animal mating systems

and why defining monogamy has been a challenge for scientists

But you won't need a textbook or to download an online lecture

All you'll simply need to do is revisit the song OPP
OPP
by Naughty by Nature

Laughter

It was released in 

Now OPP is a callandresponse song
OPP
So throughout the talk I'm going to put lyrics up on the screen

and I'm going to recite some

and I'm going to prompt you

when it's your turn to do the response OK

Cheers

Now I know some people in this audience know this song

so I need you to lead the way with the tempo and the rhythm

if that's alright OK

Right y'all ready

You down with OPP
OPP
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL You down with OPP
DNLOPP
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL You down with OPP
DNLOPP
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL That was perfect
DNL
Thank you

OPP how can I explain it
OPP
I'll take it frame by frame it

To have y'all jumping shout and singing it

O is for other P is for people scratch your temple
OP
The last P well that's not that simple
P
Now in the song the MC hints that it's a fiveletter word

but to keep it rated PG
PG
he simply refers to it as property

Laughter

The song is about cheating on your significant other

Now around the time that this song was in heavy rotation

biologists were in deep discussion about whether bird species

notably songbirds and waterfowl were actually monogamous or not

See for decades generations of science students

were taught that well over  percent of the bird species were monogamous

A male and female mating faithfully for life

That was until the late s

when a new laboratory technique came on the scene

which could copy DNA from a small tissue or fluid sample
DNA
and decode the genetics of individuals

Now before that technique

we were never ever certain about

 percent who the parents of baby birds were

All we had were our field notes

And we would know which adults lived in a nest

and which ones fed the baby birds

Well come to find out study after study kept coming in

and we found so much evidence of infidelity 

Laughter

among bird species

particularly these songbirds

that we thought were the pinnacle of monogamy

It would have made Maury Povich jealous for the ratings

Laughter

It rocked biology and ornithology so hard

we had to modify and expand the entire definition of monogamy

Now it was so bad that this was the headline

of the New York Times science section

August 

Mating for Life It's not for the Birds or the Bees
 
Laughter

We had to come up with new definitions

The situation where an individual would change partners

either between breeding seasons

or just simply because they didn't like their partner anymore

We now call this serial monogamy

Laughter

I didn't know it was going to be this funny

Laughter

The situation where we know the male and female pair together

and all the babies belong to both partners

We call that genetic monogamy

And we now recognize that it only holds true

for about  percent of the songbird species

which we were very certain were truly monogamous

And with this reclassification

we realized that in a lot of those field observations

where we saw a male and female sharing a nest

comaintaining a territory even provisioning offspring together

often included a few baby birds that did not belong to the male partner

We call this social monogamy

Laughter

And the mechanism responsible

Extrapair copulation

It's OPP time for other people's what you get it
OPP
there's no room for relationship there's just room to 

Audience Hit it

How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at

Who thinks it's wrong because I was splitting and cohitting that

Well if you do that's OPP
OPP
Actually that's EPC
EPC
Which is the abbreviation for extrapair copulation

Laughter

Now we define extrapair copulation as the mating outside of a pair bond

And just like we were discovering via science

it can lead to babies that don't belong to the male partner

Alright

Now I first learned about EPCs years later
EPC
after all the science news broke while I was in graduate school

And as we were taking a class

talking about current discoveries and mating systems

this topic comes up

And as my professor's going through the definition

and recounting all the dramatic turns of events

that lead to these new revelations

I'm sitting in class and a familiar song starts bopping in my head

I'm like You down with OPP
OPP
Yeah you know me

Laughter

I mean that's exactly what that song was about

EPCs
EPC
And what I recognized

is that this gives us an opportunity to revisit this song

Let's switch the lyrics up

So say EPC
EPC
Audience EPC
EPC
DNL Say it EPC
DNLEPC
Audience EPC
EPC
I like to say it with pride

now when you do it do it well and make sure that it counts

You're not down with a discount

You down with EPC
EPC
Audience Yeah you know me

Now I had always been playing songs in my head

while I was in science class

kind of tapping into this index of pop culture and hiphop songs

But when I would share my analogies with my science professors

all of whom were older white men

I often got blank and confused stares as responses

Laughter

But when I would share this with people from communities like mine

or other colleagues  so diverse communities 

this hiphop science remix was a hit

That's because I was either talking to people who looked and sounded like me

or at the very least you know listened to some of the same songs

We were sharing a common cultural lexicon

And with that lexicon I was able to bring new science terms to them

and together we were sharing a new comprehension of science for the culture

Now hiphop song references

are a really good tool for teaching content to students from hiphop culture

or urban communities

And I use it intentionally to connect to those students

tapping into vocabulary that they already know

and systems that they already comprehend

And what it does in that process is it ratifies them us our culture

as knowledge purveyors

I use hiphop to frame and communicate science

because I'm intentionally communicating science to broader audiences

that public science outreach has traditionally overlooked

And in the process

I am affirming the genius

that thrives in the young minds of people from every hood everywhere

So let me ask you one last time

you down with EPC
EPC
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL You down with EPC
DNLEPC
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL You down with EPC
DNLEPC
Audience Yeah you know me

DNL Who's down with EPC

Audience All the homies

Thank you

Applause and cheers

Have you ever tried to understand a teenager

It's exhausting right

You must be puzzled by the fact that some teens do well in school

lead clubs and teams

and volunteer in their communities

but they eat Tide Pods for an online challenge

speed and text while driving

binge drink and experiment with illicit drugs

How can so many teens be so smart skilled and responsible 

and careless risktakers at the same time

When I was 

while frequently observing my peers in person

as well as on social media

I began to wonder why so many teens took such crazy risks

It seems like getting a certificate from DARE class in the fifth grade
DARE
can't stop them

Laughter

What was even more alarming to me

was that the more they exposed themselves to these harmful risks

the easier it became for them to continue taking risks

Now this confused me

but it also made me incredibly curious

So as someone with a name

that literally means to explore knowledge

I started searching for a scientific explanation

Now it's no secret that teens ages  to 

are more prone to risktaking than children or adults

but what makes them so daring

Do they suddenly become reckless

or is this just a natural phase that they're going through

Well neuroscientists have already found evidence

that the teen brain is still in the process of maturation 

and that this makes them exceptionally poor at decisionmaking

causing them to fall prey to risky behaviors

But in that case if the maturing brain is to blame

then why are teens more vulnerable than children

even though their brains are more developed than those of children

Also not all teens in the world take risks at the same level

Are there some other underlying or unintentional causes

driving them to risktaking

Well this is exactly what I decided to research

So I founded my research on the basis of a psychological process

known as habituation

or simply what we refer to as getting used to it

Habituation explains how our brains adapt to some behaviors

like lying with repeated exposures

And this concept inspired me to design a project

to determine if the same principle

could be applied to the relentless rise of risktaking in teenagers

So I predicted that habituation to risktaking

may have the potential to change the alreadyvulnerable teenage brain

by blunting or even eradicating

the negative emotions associated with risk

like fear or guilt

I also thought because they would feel less fearful and guilty

this desensitization would lead them to even more risktaking

In short I wanted to conduct a research study

to answer one big question

Why do teens keep making outrageous choices

that are harmful to their health and wellbeing

But there was one big obstacle in my way

To investigate this problem

I needed teenagers to experiment on

laboratories and devices to measure their brain activity

and teachers or professors to supervise me and guide me along the way

I needed resources

But you see I attended a high school in South Dakota

with limited opportunity for scientific exploration

My school had athletics

band choir debate and other clubs

but there were no STEM programs or research mentors
STEM
And the notion of high schoolers

doing research or participating in a science fair was completely foreign

Simply put I didn't exactly have the ingredients

to make a chefworthy dish

And these obstacles were frustrating

but I was also a stubborn teenager

And as the daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants

and one of just a handful of Muslim students

in my high school in South Dakota

I often struggled to fit in

And I wanted to be someone with something to contribute to society

not just be deemed the scarfwearing brown girl

who was an anomaly in my homogenous hometown

I hoped that by doing this research

I could establish this

and how valuable scientific exploration could be for kids like me

who didn't necessarily find their niche elsewhere

So with limited research opportunities

inventiveness allowed me to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles

I became more creative in working with a variety of methodologies

materials and subjects

I transformed my unassuming school library

into a laboratory

and my peers into lab rats

Laughter

My enthusiastic geography teacher

who also happens to be my school's football coach

ended up as my cheerleader

becoming my mentor to sign necessary paperwork

And when it became logistically impossible

to use a laboratory electroencephalography

or EEG

which are those electrode devices used to measure emotional responses

I bought a portable EEG headset with my own money

instead of buying the new iPhone X
iPhone X
that a lot of kids my age were saving up for

So finally I started the research

with  students ages  to  from my high school

Using the computer cubicles in my school library

I had them complete a computerized decisionmaking simulation

to measure their risktaking behaviors comparable to ones in the real world

like alcohol use drug use and gambling

Wearing the EEG headset

the students completed the test  times over three days

to mimic repeated risk exposures

A control panel on the EEG headset

measured their various emotional responses

like attention interest excitement frustration

guilt stress levels and relaxation

They also rated their emotions

on wellvalidated emotionmeasuring scales

This meant that I had measured the process of habituation

and its effects on decisionmaking

And it took  days to complete this research

And with months of frantically drafting proposals

meticulously computing data in a caffeinated daze at am

I was able to finalize my results

And the results showed that habituation to risktaking

could actually change a teen's brain by altering their emotional levels

causing greater risktaking

The students' emotions that were normally associated with risks

like fear stress guilt and nervousness

as well as attention

were high when they were first exposed to the risk simulator

This curbed their temptations and enforced selfcontrol

which prevented them from taking more risks

However the more they were exposed to the risks through the simulator

the less fearful guilty and stressed they became

This caused a situation

in which they were no longer able to feel

the brain's natural fear and caution instincts

And also because they are teenagers and their brains are still underdeveloped

they became more interested and excited in thrillseeking behaviors

So what were the consequences

They lacked selfcontrol for logical decisionmaking

took greater risks

and made more harmful choices

So the developing brain alone isn't to blame

The process of habituation also plays a key role in risktaking

and risk escalation

Although a teen's willingness to seek risk

is largely a result of the structural and functional changes

associated with their developing brains

the dangerous part that my research was able to highlight

was that a habituation to risks

can actually physically change a teen's brain

and cause greater risktaking

So it's the combination of the immature teen brain

and the impact of habituation

that is like a perfect storm to create more damaging effects

And this research can help parents and the general public

understand that teens aren't just willfully ignoring warnings

or simply defying parents by engaging in increasingly more dangerous behavior

The biggest hurdle they're facing is their habituation to risks

all the physical detectable and emotional functional changes

that drive and control and influence their overthetop risktaking

So yes we need policies that provide safer environments

and limit exposures to high risks

but we also need policies that reflect this insight

These results are a wakeup call for teens too

It shows them that the natural and necessary fear and guilt

that protect them from unsafe situations

actually become numb when they repeatedly choose risky behaviors

So with this hope to share my findings with fellow teenagers and scientists

I took my research

to the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair or ISEF

a culmination of over  students

from  countries regions and territories

who showcase their cuttingedge research and inventions

It's like the Olympics of science fair

Laughter

There I was able to present my research to experts in neuroscience and psychology

and garner valuable feedback

But perhaps the most memorable moment of the week

was when the booming speakers suddenly uttered my name

during the awards ceremony

I was in such disbelief that I questioned myself

Was this just another La La Land blunder

like at the Oscars

Laughter

Luckily it wasn't

I really had won first place

in the category Behavioral and Social Sciences

Applause

Needless to say

I was not only thrilled to have this recognition

but also the whole experience of science fair that validated my efforts

keeps my curiosity alive

and strengthens my creativity

perseverance and imagination

This still image of me experimenting in my school library

may seem ordinary

but to me it represents a sort of inspiration

It reminds me that this process taught me to take risks

And I know that might sound incredibly ironic

But I took risks realizing

that unforeseen opportunities often come from risktaking 

not the hazardous negative type that I studied

but the good ones

the positive risks

The more risks I took

the more capable I felt of withstanding my unconventional circumstances

leading to more tolerance resilience and patience

for completing my project

And these lessons have led me to new ideas

like Is the opposite of negative risktaking also true

Can positive risktaking escalate with repeated exposures

Does positive action build positive brain functioning

I think I just might have my next research idea

Applause

I recently had an epiphany

I realized that I could actually play a role

in solving one of the biggest problems that faces mankind today

and that is the problem of climate change

It also dawned on me that I had been working for  years or more

just to get to this point in my life

where I could actually make this contribution to a bigger problem

And every experiment that I have done in my lab

over the last  years

and people who work for me did in my lab over the last  years

has been directed toward doing the really big experiment

this one last big experiment

So who am I

I'm a plant geneticist

I live in a world where there's too much CO in the atmosphere

because of human activity

But I've come to appreciate the plants

as amazing machines that they are

whose job has been really to just suck up CO

And they do it so well

because they've been doing it for over  million years

And they're really good at it

And so 

I also have some urgency I want to tell you about

As a mother I want to give my two children a better world

than I inherited from my parents

it would be nicer to keep it going in the right direction

not the bad direction

But I also 

I've had Parkinson's for the last  years

and this gives me a sense of urgency that I want to do this now

while I feel good enough to really be part of this team

And I have an incredible team

We all work together

and this is something we want to do because we have fun

And if you're only going to have five people trying to save the planet

you better like each other

because you're going to be spending a lot of time together

Laughter

OK alright But enough about me

Let's talk about CO

CO is the star of my talk

Now most of you probably think of CO as a pollutant

Or perhaps you think of CO as the villain in the novel you know

It's always the dark side of CO

But as a plant biologist I see the other side of CO actually

And that CO that we see

we see it differently because I think we remember as plant biologists

something you may have forgotten

And that is that plants actually do this process called photosynthesis

And when they do photosynthesis 

all carbonbased life on our earth

is all because of the CO that plants and other photosynthetic microbes

have dragged in from CO that was in the atmosphere

And almost all of the carbon in your body came from air basically

So you come from air

and it's because of photosynthesis

because what plants do is they use the energy in sunlight

take that CO and fix it into sugars

It's a great thing

And the other thing that is really important

for what I'm going to tell you today

is that plants and other photosynthetic microbes

have a great capacity for doing this 

twentyfold or more than the amount of CO that we put up

because of our human activities

And so even though we're not doing a great job

at cutting our emissions and things

plants have the capacity

as photosynthetic organisms to help out

So we're hoping that's what they'll do

But there's a catch here

We have to help the plants a little ourselves

because what plants like to do is put most of the CO into sugars

And when the end of the growing season comes

the plant dies and decomposes

and then all that work they did to suck out the CO from the atmosphere

and make carbonbased biomass

is now basically going right back up in the atmosphere as CO

So how can we get plants to redistribute the CO they bring in

into something that's a little more stable

And so it turns out that plants make this product

and it's called suberin
suberin
This is a natural product that is in all plant roots

And suberin is really cool
Suberin
because as you can see there I hope

everywhere you see a black dot that's a carbon

There's hundreds of them in this molecule

And where you see those few red dots

those are oxygens

And oxygen is what microbes like to find

so they can decompose a plant

So you can see why this is a perfect carbon storage device

And actually it can stabilize the carbon that gets fixed by the plant

into something that's a little bit better for the plant

And so why now

Why is now a good time to do a biological solution to this problem

It's because over the last  or so years 

and I know that's a long time you're saying Why now 
 
but  years ago we began to understand

the functions of all the genes that are in an organism in general

And that included humans as well as plants

and many other complicated eukaryotes

And so what did the s begin

What began then is that we now know

the function of many of the genes that are in a plant

that tell a plant to grow

And that has now converged with the fact that we can do genomics

in a faster and cheaper way than we ever did before

And what that tells us is that all life on earth is really related

but plants are more related to each other than other organisms

And that you can take a trait that you know from one plant

and put it in another plant

and you can make a prediction that it'll do the same thing

And so that's important as well

Then finally we have these little genetic tricks that came along

like you heard about this morning 

things like CRISPR that allows us to do editing
CRISPR
and make genes be a little different from the normal state in the plant

OK so now we have biology on our side

I'm a biologist so that's why I'm proposing a solution

to the climate change problem

that really involves the best evolved organism on earth to do it  plants

So how are we going to do it

Biology comes to the rescue

Here we go

OK

You have to remember three simple things from my talk OK

We have to get plants to make more suberin than they normally make
suberin
because we need them to be a little better than what they are

We have to get them to make more roots

because if we make more roots we can make more suberin 

now we have more of the cells that suberin likes to accumulate in
suberin
And then the third thing is we want the plants to have deeper roots

And what that does is 

we're asking the plant actually OK make stable carbon

more than you used to

and then bury it for us in the ground

So they can do that if they make roots that go deep

rather than meander around on the surface of the soil

Those are the three traits we want to change

more suberin more roots and the last one deep roots

Then we want to combine all those traits in one plant

and we can do that easily and we will do it

and we are doing it actually in the model plant Arabidopsis

which allows us to do these experiments much faster

than we can do in another big plant

And when we find that we have plants where traits all add up

and we can get more of them more suberin in those plants
suberin
we're going to move it all 

we can and we we will we're beginning to do this 

move it to crop plants

And I'll tell you why we're picking crop plants to do the work for us

when I get to that part of my talk

OK so I think this is the science behind the whole thing

And so I know we can do the science I feel pretty confident about that

And the reason is because just in the last year

we've been able to find single genes that affect each of those three traits

And in several of those cases two out of the three

we have more than one way to get there

So that tells us we might be able to even combine within a trait

and get even more suberin

This shows one result

where we have a plant here on the right

that's making more than double the amount of root

than the plant on the left

and that's just because of the way we expressed one gene

that's normally in the plant

in a slightly different way than the plant usually does on its own

Alright so that's just one example I wanted to show you

And now I want to tell you that you know

we still have a lot of challenges actually

when we get to this problem

because it takes 

We have to get the farmers to actually buy the seeds

or at least the seed company to buy seeds

that farmers are going to want to have

And so when we do the experiments

we can't actually take a loss in yield

because while we are doing these experiments

say beginning about  years from now

the earth's population will be even more than it is right now

And it's rapidly growing still

So by the end of the century we have  billion people

we have wasted ecosystems that aren't really going to be able to handle

all the load they have to take from agriculture

And then we also have this competition for land

And so we figure to do this carbon sequestration experiment

actually requires a fair amount of land

We can't take it away from food

because we have to feed the people that are also going to be on the earth

until we get past this big crisis

And the climate change is actually causing loss of yield all over the earth

So why would farmers want to buy seeds

if it's going to impact yield

So we're not going to let it impact yield

we're going to always have checks and balances

that says go or no go on that experiment

And then the second thing is when a plant actually makes more carbon

and buries it in the soil like that

almost all the soils on earth are actually depleted of carbon

because of the load from agriculture

trying to feed eight billion people

which is what lives on the earth right now

And so that is also a problem as well

Plants that are making more carbon those soils become enriched in carbon

And carbonenriched soils actually hold nitrogen

and they hold sulphur and they hold phosphate 

all the minerals that are required for plants to grow and have a good yield

And they also retain water in the soil as well

So the suberin will break up into little particles

and give the whole soil a new texture

And as we've shown that we can get more carbon in that soil

the soil will get darker

And so we will be able to measure all that

and hopefully this is going to help us solve the problem

So OK

So we have the challenges of a lot of land that we need to use

we have to get farmers to buy it

and that's going to be the hard thing for us I think

because we're not really salesmen

we're people who like to Google a person rather than meet them

you know what I mean

Laughter

That's what scientists are mostly like

But we know now that you know no one can really deny 

the climate is changing everyone knows that

And it's here and it's bad and it's serious

and we need to do something about it

But I feel pretty optimistic that we can do this

So I'm here today as a character witness for plants

And I want to tell you that plants are going to do it for us

all we have to do is give them a little help

and they will go and get a gold medal for humanity

Thank you very much

Thank you

I finally got it out

Chris Anderson Wow

Joanne you're so extraordinary

Just to be sure we heard this right

you believe that within the next  years

you may be able to offer the world

seed variants for the major crops like  what  wheat corn maybe rice
 
that can offer farmers just as much yield

sequester three times four times more carbon than they currently do

Even more than that

Joanne Chory We don't know that number really

But they will do more

CA And at the same time
CA
make the soil that those farmers have more fertile

JC Yes right
JC
CA So that is astonishing
CA
And the genius of doing that and a solution that can scale

where there's already scale

JC Yes thank you for saying that
JC
CA No no you said it you said it
CA
But it almost seems too good to be true

Your Audacious Project is that we scale up the research in your lab

and pave the way to start some of these pilots

and make this incredible vision possible

JC That's right yes thank you
JC
CA Joanne Chory thank you so much

So when I was a little girl

a book sat on the coffee table in our living room

just steps from our front door

And the living room is a first impression

Ours had white carpet

and a curio of my mother's most treasured collectibles

That room represented the sacrifices of generations gone by

who by poverty or by policy

couldn't afford a curio of collectibles

let alone a middle class house to put them in

That room had to stay perfect

But I would risk messing up that perfect room every day

just to see that book

On the cover sat a woman named Septima Clark

She sat in perfect profile with her face raised to the sky

She had perfect saltandpepper cornrows

platted down the sides of her head

and pride and wisdom just emanated from her dark skin

Septima Clark was an activist and an educator

a woman after whom I'd eventually model my own career

But more than all the words she ever spoke

that single portrait of Septima Clark
Septima Clark
it defined confidence for me

before I ever even knew the word

It may sound simple

but confidence is something that we underestimate the importance of

We treat it like a nicetohave instead of a musthave

We place value on knowledge and resources

above what we deem to be the soft skill of confidence

But by most measures we have more knowledge

and more resources now than at any other point in history

and still injustice abounds and challenges persist

If knowledge and resources were all that we needed

we wouldn't still be here

And I believe that confidence is one of the main things

missing from the equation

I'm completely obsessed with confidence

It's been the most important journey of my life

a journey that to be honest I'm still on

Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows

Confidence is the difference between being inspired

and actually getting started

between trying and doing until it's done

Confidence helps us keep going even when we failed

The name of the book on that coffee table was I Dream A World

and today I dream a world where revolutionary confidence

helps bring about our most ambitious dreams into reality

That's exactly the kind of world that I wanted to create in my classroom

when I was a teacher

like a Willy Wonka world of pure imagination

but make it scholarly

All of my students were black or brown

All of them were growing up in a lowincome circumstance

Some of them were immigrants some of them were disabled

but all of them were the very last people

this world invites to be confident

That's why it was so important that my classroom be a place

where my students could build the muscle of confidence

where they could learn to face each day with the confidence you need

to redesign the world in the image of your own dreams

After all what are academic skills without the confidence to use those skills

to go out and change the world

Now is when I should tell you about two of my students Jamal and Regina

Now I've changed their names but their stories remain the same

Jamal was brilliant but unfocused

He would squirm in his chair during independent work

and he would never stay still for more than three or four minutes

Students like Jamal can perplex brand new teachers

because they're not quite sure how to support young people like him

I took a direct approach

I negotiated with Jamal

If he could give me focused work

then he could do it from anywhere in the classroom

from our classroom rug from behind my desk

from inside his classroom locker which turned out to be his favorite place

Jamal's least favorite subject was writing

and he never wanted to read what he had written out loud in class

but we were still making progress

One day I decided to host a mock  presidential election

in my classroom

My third graders had to research and write a stump speech

for their chosen candidate

Barack Obama Hillary Clinton or John McCain

The heavy favorites were obvious

but one student chose John McCain

It was Jamal

Jamal finally decided to read something that he had written out loud in class

and sure enough Jamal stunned all of us with his brilliance

Just like Jamal's dad John McCain was a veteran

and just like Jamal's dad protected him

Jamal believed that John McCain would protect the entire country

And he wasn't my candidate of choice but it didn't matter

because the entire class erupted into applause

a standing ovation for our brave friend Jamal

who finally showed up as his most confident self

for the first time that year

And then there was Regina

Regina was equally as brilliant but active

She'd inevitably finish her work early

and then she'd get on about the business of distracting other students

Laughter

Walking talking

passing those notes that teachers hate but kids love

You look like you passed a lot of them

Laughter

Despite my high ideals for our classroom

I would too often default to my baser instincts

and I would choose compliance over confidence

Regina was a glitch in my intended system

A good teacher can correct misbehavior

but still remain a student's champion

But on one day in particular

I just plain old chose control

I snapped

and my approach didn't communicate to Regina

that she was being a distraction

My approach communicated to Regina that she herself was a distraction

I watched the light go out from her eyes

and that light sparked joy in our classroom

I had just extinguished it

The entire class became irritable

and we didn't recover for the rest of the day

I think about the day often

and I have literally prayed that I did not do irreparable harm

because as a woman who used to be a little girl just like Regina

I know that I could have started the process of killing her confidence

forever

A lack of confidence pulls us down from the bottom

and weighs us down from the top

crushing us between a flurry of can'ts won'ts and impossibles

Without confidence we get stuck

and when we get stuck we can't even get started

Instead of getting mired in what can get in our way

confidence invites us to perform with certainty

We all operate a little differently when we're sure we can win

versus if we just hope we will

Now this can be a helpful check

If you don't have enough confidence

it could be because you need to readjust your goal

If you have too much confidence

it could be because you're not rooted in something real

Not everyone lacks confidence

We make it easier in this society for some people to gain confidence

because they fit our preferred archetype of leadership

We reward confidence in some people

and we punish confidence in others

and all the while far too many people

are walking around every single day without it

For some of us

confidence is a revolutionary choice

and it would be our greatest shame

to see our best ideas go unrealized

and our brightest dreams go unreached

all because we lacked the engine of confidence

That's not a risk I'm willing to take

So how do we crack the code on confidence

In my estimation it takes at least three things

permission community and curiosity

Permission births confidence

community nurtures it

and curiosity affirms it

In education we've got a saying

that you can't be what you can't see

When I was a little girl I couldn't show confidence

until someone showed me

My family used to do everything together

including the mundane things like buying a new car

and every time we did this

I'd watch my parents put on the exact same performance

We'd enter the dealership

and my dad would sit

while my mom shopped

When my mom found a car that she liked

they'd go in and meet with the dealer

and inevitably every time the dealer would turn his attention

and his body to my dad

assuming that he controlled the purse strings

and therefore this negotiation

Rev Packnett they'd say how do we get you into this car today
Rev
My dad would inevitably respond the same way

He'd slowly and silently gesture toward my mother

and then put his hands right back in his lap

It might have been the complete shock

of negotiating finances with a black woman in the 's

but whatever it was

I'd watch my mother work these car dealers over

until they were basically giving the car away for free

Laughter

She would never crack a smile

She would never be afraid to walk away

I know my mom just thought she was getting a good deal on a minivan

but what she was actually doing

was giving me permission to defy expectations

and to show up confidently in my skill no matter who doubts me

Confidence needs permission to exist

and community is the safest place to try confidence on

I traveled to Kenya this year to learn about women's empowerment

among Maasai women

There I met a group of young women

called Team Lioness

among Kenya's first allfemale community ranger groups

These eight brave young women were making history

in just their teenage years

and I asked Purity the most verbose young ranger among them

Do you ever get scared

I swear to you I want to tattoo her response all over my entire body

She said Of course I do

but I call on my sisters

They remind me that we will be better than these men

and that we will not fail

Purity's confidence to chase down lions and catch poachers

it didn't come from her athletic ability or even just her faith

Her confidence was propped up by sisterhood

by community

What she was basically saying was that if I am ever in doubt

I need you to be there

to restore my hope

and to rebuild my certainty

In community I can find my confidence

and your curiosity can affirm it

Early in my career I led a largescale event

that did not go exactly as planned

I'm lying to you It was terrible

And when I debriefed the event with my manager

I just knew that she was going to run down the list

of every mistake I had ever made

probably from birth

But instead she opened with a question

What was your intention

I was surprised but relieved

She knew that I was already beating myself up

and that question invited me to learn from my own mistakes

instead of damage my already fragile confidence

Curiosity invites people to be in charge of their own learning

That exchange it helped me approach my next project

with the expectation of success

Permission community curiosity

all of these are the things that we will need to breed the confidence

that we'll absolutely need to solve our greatest challenges

and to build the world we dream

a world where inequity is ended and where justice is real

a world where we can be free on the outside and free on the inside

because we know that none of us are free until all of us are free

A world that isn't intimidated by confidence

when it shows up as a woman

or in black skin

or in anything other than our preferred archetypes of leadership

A world that knows that that kind of confidence

is exactly the key we need to unlock the future that we want

I have enough confidence to believe that that world

will indeed come to pass

and that we are the ones to make it so

Thank you so much

Applause

My parents gave me an extraordinary name

Baratunde Rafiq Thurston
Baratunde Rafiq Thurston
Now Baratunde is based on a Yoruba name from Nigeria
BaratundeYoruba
but we're not Nigerian

Laughter

That's just how black my mama was

Laughter

Get this boy the blackest name possible What does the book say

Laughter

Rafiq is an Arabic name but we are not Arabs

My mom just wanted me to have difficulty boarding planes in the st century

Laughter

She foresaw America's turn toward nativism

She was a black futurist

Laughter

Thurston is a British name but we are not British

Shoutout to the multigenerational dehumanizing economic institution

of American chattel slavery though

Also Thurston makes for a great Starbucks name

Really expedites the process

Laughter

My mother was a renaissance woman

Arnita Lorraine Thurston
Arnita Lorraine Thurston
was a computer programmer former domestic worker

survivor of sexual assault

an artist and an activist

She prepared me for this world with lessons in black history

in martial arts in urban farming

and then she sent me in the seventh grade to the private Sidwell Friends School

where US presidents send their daughters

and where she sent me looking like this

Laughter

I had two key tasks going to that school

don't lose your blackness and don't lose your glasses

This accomplished both

Laughter

Sidwell was a great place to learn the arts and the sciences

but also the art of living amongst whiteness

That would prepare me for life later at Harvard

or doing corporate consulting
Or doing corporate consulting
or for my jobs at The Daily Show and The Onion

I would write down many of these lessons in my memoir How to Be Black
How to Be Black
which if you haven't read yet makes you a racist because 

Laughter

you've had plenty of time to read the book

But America insists on reminding me

and teaching me

what it means to be black in America

It's December 

I'm with my fianc in the suburbs of Wisconsin

We are visiting her parents both of whom are white

which makes her white

That's how it works I don't make the rules

Laughter

She's had some drinks so I drive us in her parents' car

and we get pulled over by the police

I'm scared

I turn on the flashing lights to indicate compliance

I pull over slowly

under the brightest streetlight I can find

in case I need witnesses or dashcam footage

We get out my identification the car registration

lay it out in the open roll down the windows

my hands are placed on the steering wheel

all before the officer exits the vehicle

This is how to stay alive

As we wait I think about these headlines 

Police shoot another unarmed black person 

and I don't want to join them

The good news is our officer was friendly

She told us our tags were expired

So to all the white parents out there

if your child is involved with a person

whose skin tone is rated Dwayne The Rock Johnson or darker 
DwayneThe RockJohnson
Laughter

you need to get that car inspected update the paperwork every time we visit

That's just common courtesy

Laughter

Applause

I got lucky

I got a law enforcement professional

I survived something that should not require survival

And I think about this series of stories 

Police shoot another unarmed black person 

and that season when those stories popped up everywhere

I would scroll through my feed

and I would see a baby announcement photo

I'd see an ad for a product

I had just whispered to a friend about yesterday

I would see a video of a police officer gunning down someone

who looked just like me

And I'd see a think piece

about how millennials have replaced sex with avocado toast

Laughter

It was a confusing time

Those stories kept popping up

but in  those stories got changed out for a different type of story

stories like White Woman Calls Cops On Black Woman Waiting For An Uber

That was Brooklyn Becky

Then there was White Woman Calls Police

On EightYearOld Black Girl Selling Water

That was Permit Patty

Then there was Woman Calls Police

On Black Family BBQing At Lake In Oakland
BBQing
That was now infamous BBQ Becky

And I contend that these stories of living while black

are actually progress

We used to find out after the extrajudicial police killings

Now we're getting video of people calling 

We're moving upstream

closer to the problem and closer to the solution

So I started a collection

of as many of these stories as I could find

I built an evolving stillgrowing database

at baratundecomlivingwhileblack
baratundecomlivingwhile black
Seeking understanding I realized the process

was really diagramming sentences to understand these headlines

And I want to thank my Sidwell English teacher Erica Berry

and all English teachers

You have given us tools to fight for our own freedom

What I found was a process to break down the headline

and understand the consistent layers

in each one

a subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity

so that White Woman Calls Police On EightYearOld Black Girl

is the same as White Man Calls Police On Black Woman Using Neighborhood Pool

is the same as Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker

Campaigning In Her District

They're the same

Diagramming the sentences allowed me to diagram the white supremacy

which allowed such sentences to be true

and I will pause to define my terms

When I say white supremacy

I'm not just talking about Nazis

or white power activists

and I'm definitely not saying that all white people are racist

What I'm referring to

is a system of structural advantage that favors white people over others

in social economic and political arenas

It's what Bryan Stevenson at the Equal Justice Initiative

calls the narrative of racial difference

the story we told ourselves to justify slavery and Jim Crow

and mass incarceration and beyond

So when I saw this pattern repeating

I got angry

but I also got inspired

to create a game

a game of words that would allow me to transform this traumatic exposure

into more of a healing experience

I'm going to talk you through the game

The first level is a training level and I need your participation

Our objective to determine if this is real or fake

Did this happen or not

Here is the example

Catholic University Law Librarian Calls Police On Student

For 'Being Argumentative'

Clap your hands if you think this is real

Applause

Clap your hands if you think this is fake

Applause

The reals have it unfortunately

and a point of information

being argumentative in a law library

is the exact right place to do that

Laughter

This student should be promoted to professor

Training level complete so we move on to the real levels

Level one our objective is simple

reverse the roles

That means Woman Calls Cops On Black Oregon Lawmaker

becomes Black Oregon Lawmaker Calls Cops On Woman

That means White Man Calls Police On Black Woman

Using Neighborhood Pool

becomes Black Woman Calls Police On White Man Using Neighborhood Pool

How do you like them reverse racist apples

That's it level one complete

and so we level up to level two

where our objective is to increase the believability of the reversal

Let's face it a black woman calling police on a white man using a pool

isn't absurd enough

but what if that white man was trying to touch her hair without asking

or maybe he was making oat milk while riding a unicycle

or maybe he's just talking over everyone in a meeting

Laughter

We've all been there right

Seriously we've all been there

So that's it level two complete

But it comes with a warning

simply reversing the flow of injustice is not justice

That is vengeance that is not our mission

that's a different game so we level up to level three

where the objective is to change the action

also known as calling the police is not your only option

OMG what is wrong with you people

Applause

And I need to pause the game to remind us of the structure

A subject takes an action against a target engaged in some activity

White Woman Calls Police On Black Real Estate Investor

Inspecting His Own Property

California Safeway Calls Cops On Black Woman
Safeway
Donating Food To The Homeless

Gold Club Twice Calls Cops On Black Women For Playing Too Slow

In all these cases the subject is usually white

the target is usually black

and the activities are anything

from sitting in a Starbucks

to using the wrong type of barbecue

to napping

to walking agitated on the way to work

which I just call walking to work

Laughter

And my personal favorite

not stopping his dog from humping her dog

which is clearly a case for dog police

not people police

All of these activities add up to living

Our existence is being interpreted as crime

Now this is the obligatory moment in the presentation where I have to say

not everything is about race

Crime is a thing should be reported

but ask yourself do we need armed men to show up and resolve this situation

because when they show up for me

it's different

We know that police officers

use force more with black people than with white people

and we are learning the role of  calls in this

Thanks to preliminary research from the Center for Policing Equity

we're learning that in some cities

most of the interactions between cops and citizens

is due to  calls

not officerinitiated stops

and most of the violence the use of force by police on citizens

is in response to those calls

Further when those officers responding to calls use force

that increases in areas

where the percentage of the white population

has also increased

aka gentrification

aka unicycles and oat milk

aka when BBQ Becky feels threatened
AkaBBQ Becky
she becomes a threat to me in my own neighborhood

which forces me and people like me

to police ourselves

We quiet ourselves we walk on eggshells

we maybe pull over to the side of the road

under the brightest light we can find

so that our murder

might be caught cleanly on camera

and we do this because we live in a system

in which white people can too easily call on deadly force

to ensure their comfort

Applause

The California Safeway

didn't just call cops on black woman donating food to homeless

They ordered armed unaccountable men upon her

They essentially called in a drone strike

This is weaponized discomfort

and it is not new

From  to 

there were at least  documented racial terror lynchings of black people

in the United States

They had headlines as well

Rev TA Allen was lynched in Hernando Mississippi
Rev
for organizing local sharecroppers

Oliver Moore was lynched in Edgecomb County North Carolina
Oliver MooreEdgecomb
for frightening a white girl

Nathan Bird was lynched near Luling Texas

for refusing to turn his son over to a mob

We need to change the action

whether that action is lynches

or calls police

And now that I have shortened the distance between those two

let's get back to our game to our mission

Our objective in level three is to change the action

So what if instead of

Calls Cops On Black Woman Donating Food To Homeless

that California Safeway simply thanks her

Thanking is far cheaper than bringing law enforcement to the scene

Applause

Or instead

they could give the food they would have wasted to her

upped their civic cred

Or the white woman who called the police on the eightyearold black girl

she could have bought all the inventory from that little black girl

support a small business

And the white woman who called the police on the black real estate investor

we would all be better off the cops agree

if she had simply ignored him and minded her own damn business

Laughter

Minding one's own damn business is an excellent choice excellent choice

Choose it more often

Level three is complete but there is a final bonus level

where the objective is inclusion

We have also seen headlines like this

Powerful Man Masturbates In Front Of Young Women

Visiting His Office

What an odd choice for powerful man to make

So many other actions available to him

Laughter

Like such as listens to

mentors

inspired by starts joint venture everybody rich now

Laughter

I want to live in that world of everybody rich now

but because of his poor choice we are all in a poorer world

Doesn't have to be this way

This word game reminded me that there is a structure to white supremacy

as there is to misogyny

as there is to all systemic abuses of power

Structure is what makes them systemic

I'm asking people here

to see the structure

where the power is in it

and even more importantly to see the humanity

of those of us made targets by this structure

I am here because I was loved and invested in and protected and lucky

because I went to the right schools I'm semifamous mostly happy

meditate twice a day

and yet

I walk around in fear

because I know that someone seeing me as a threat

can become a threat to my life

and I am tired

I am tired of carrying

this invisible burden of other people's fears

and many of us are

and we shouldn't have to

because we can change this

because we can change the action which changes the story

which changes the system

that allows those stories to happen

Systems are just collective stories we all buy into

When we change them

we write a better reality for us all to be a part of

I am asking us

to use our power to choose

I am asking us to level up

Thank you

I am Baratunde Rafiq Thurston

In the summer of 

a woman was murdered by her partner in Sofia

The woman let's call her V
V
was beaten for over  minutes

before she died

The morning after

her neighbors told the press that they heard her screams

but they didn't intervene

You see in Bulgaria and many other societies

domestic violence is typically seen as a private matter

Neighbors however are quick to react to any other kind of noise

We wanted to expose and affect the absurdity of this

So we designed an experiment

We rented the apartment just below V's for one night
V
And at pm

Maksim the artist in our group

sat on the drum set we had assembled in the living room

and started beating it

Ten seconds

Thirty seconds

Fifty seconds

A minute

A light came on in the hallway

One minute and  seconds

A man was standing at the door hesitant to press the bell

One minute and  seconds

The doorbell rang

a ring that could have saved a life

Beat is our project exploring the ominous silence
 
surrounding domestic violence

We filmed the experiment and it became instantly viral

Our campaign amplified the voices of survivors

who shared similar stories online

It equipped neighbors with specific advice

and many committed to taking action

In a country where every other week

the ground quietly embraces the body of a woman

murdered by a partner or a relative

we were loud

and we were heard

I am an activist

passionate about human rights innovation

I lead a global organization for socially engaged creative solutions

In my work I think about how to make people care and act

I am here to tell you that creative actions can save the world

creative actions and play

I know it is weird to talk about play and human rights in the same sentence

but here is why it's important

More and more we fear that we can't win this

Campaigns feel dull

messages drown

people break

Numerous studies including a recent one published by Columbia University

show that burnout and depression are widespread amongst activists

Years ago I myself was burned out

In a world of endless ways forward I felt at my final stop

So what melts fear or dullness or gloom

Play

From this very stage psychiatrist and play researcher Dr Stuart Brown

said that nothing lights up the brain like play

and that the opposite of play is not work

it's depression

So to pull out of my own burnout

I decided to turn my activism into what I call today playtivism

Laughter

When we play others want to join

Today my playground is filled with artists

techies and scientists

We fuse disciplines in radical collaboration

Together we seek new ways to empower activism

Our outcomes are not meant to be playful

but our process is

To us play is an act of resistance

For example Beat the project I talked about earlier
Beat
is a concept developed by a drummer and a software engineer

who didn't know each other two days before they pitched the idea

Beat is the first winner in our lab series
 
where we pair artists and technologists to work on human rights issues

Other winning concepts include a popup bakery

that teaches about fake news through beautiful but horribletasting cupcakes 

Laughter

or a board game that puts you in the shoes of a dictator

so you get to really grasp the range of tools and tactics of oppression

We did our first lab just to test the idea

to see where it cracks and if we can make it better

Today we are so in love with the format that we put it all online

for anyone to implement

I cannot overstate the value of experimentation in activism

We can only win if we are not afraid to lose

When we play we learn

A recent study published by Stanford University

about the science of what makes people care

reconfirms what we have been hearing for years

opinions are changed not from more information

but through empathyinducing experiences

So learning from science and art

we saw that we can talk about global armed conflict through light bulbs

or address racial inequality in the US

through postcards

or tackle the lack of even one single monument of a woman in Sofia

by flooding the city with them

and with all these works

to trigger dialogue understanding and direct action

Sometimes when I talk about taking risks and trying and failing

in the context of human rights

I meet raised eyebrows

eyebrows that say How irresponsible

or How insensitive

People often mistake play for negligence

It is not

Play doesn't just grow our armies stronger or spark better ideas

In times of painful injustice

play brings the levity we need to be able to breathe

When we play we live

I grew up in a time

when all play was forbidden

My family's lives were crushed by a communist dictatorship

For my aunt my grandfather my father

we always held two funerals

one for their bodies

but years before that

one for their dreams

Some of my biggest dreams are nightmares

I have a nightmare that one day all the past will be forgotten

and new clothes will be dripping the blood of past mistakes

I have a nightmare

that one day the lighthouses of our humanity will crumble

corroded by acid waves of hate

But way more than that

I have hope

In our fights for justice and freedom

I hope that we play

and that we see the joy and beauty of us playing together

That's how we win

Thank you

Applause

I bring you greetings

from the ndfreest nation on earth

As an American it irritates me that my nation keeps sinking

in the annual rankings published by Freedom House

I'm the son of immigrants

My parents were born in China during war and revolution

went to Taiwan and then came to the United States

which means all my life

I've been acutely aware just how fragile an inheritance freedom truly is

That's why I spend my time teaching preaching and practicing democracy

I have no illusions

All around the world now

people are doubting whether democracy can deliver

Autocrats and demagogues seem emboldened

even cocky

The free world feels leaderless

And yet I remain hopeful

I don't mean optimistic

Optimism is for spectators

Hope implies agency

It says I have a hand in the outcome

Democratic hope requires faith

not in a strongman or a charismatic savior

but in each other

and it forces us to ask How can we become worthy of such faith

I believe we are at a moment of moral awakening

the kind that comes when old certainties collapse

At the heart of that awakening is what I call civic religion

And today I want to talk about what civic religion is

how we practice it

and why it matters now more than ever

Let me start with the what

I define civic religion as a system of shared beliefs and collective practices

by which the members of a selfgoverning community

choose to live like citizens

Now when I say citizen here I'm not referring to papers or passports

I'm talking about a deeper broader ethical conception

of being a contributor to community a member of the body

To speak of civic religion as religion is not poetic license

That's because democracy

is one of the most faithfueled human activities there is

Democracy works only when enough of us believe democracy works

It is at once a gamble and a miracle

Its legitimacy comes not from the outer frame of constitutional rules

but from the inner workings of civic spirit

Civic religion like any religion

contains a sacred creed sacred deeds and sacred rituals

My creed includes words like equal protection of the laws

and we the people

My roll call of hallowed deeds includes abolition women's suffrage

the civil rights movement

the Allied landing at Normandy

the fall of the Berlin Wall

And I have a new civic ritual that I'll tell you about in a moment

Wherever on earth you're from

you can find or make your own set of creed deed and ritual

The practice of civic religion is not about worship of the state

or obedience to a ruling party

It is about commitment to one another

and our common ideals

And the sacredness of civic religion is not about divinity or the supernatural

It is about a group of unlike people

speaking into being our alikeness

our groupness

Perhaps now you're getting a little worried

that I'm trying to sell you on a cult

Relax I'm not

I don't need to sell you

As a human you are always in the market for a cult

for some variety of religious experience

We are wired to seek cosmological explanations

to sacralize beliefs that unite us in transcendent purpose

Humans make religion because humans make groups

The only choice we have is whether to activate that groupness for good

If you are a devout person you know this

If you are not

if you no longer go to prayer services

or never did

then perhaps you'll say that yoga is your religion

or Premier League football

or knitting or coding or TED Talks
TED
But whether you believe in a God or in the absence of gods

civic religion does not require you to renounce your beliefs

It requires you only to show up as a citizen

And that brings me to my second topic

how we can practice civic religion productively

Let me tell you now about that new civic ritual

It's called Civic Saturday

and it follows the arc of a faith gathering

We sing together

we turn to the strangers next to us to discuss a common question

we hear poetry and scripture

there's a sermon that ties those texts

to the ethical choices and controversies of our time

but the song and scripture and the sermon

are not from church or synagogue or mosque

They are civic

drawn from our shared civic ideals

and a shared history of claiming and contesting those ideals

Afterwards we form up in circles to organize rallies register voters

join new clubs make new friends

My colleagues and I started organizing Civic Saturdays

in Seattle in 

Since then they have spread across the continent

Sometimes hundreds attend sometimes dozens

They happen in libraries and community centers

and coworking spaces

under festive tents and inside great halls

There's nothing hightech about this social technology

It speaks to a basic human yearning for facetoface fellowship

It draws young and old left and right

poor and rich churched and unchurched

of all races

When you come to a Civic Saturday and are invited to discuss a question

like Who are you responsible for

or What are you willing to risk or to give up for your community

When that happens something moves

You are moved

You start telling your story

We start actually seeing one another

You realize that homelessness gun violence gentrification

terrible traffic mistrust of newcomers fake news 

these things aren't someone else's problem

they are the aggregation of your own habits and omissions

Society becomes how you behave

We are never asked to reflect on the content of our citizenship

Most of us are never invited to do more or to be more

and most of us have no idea how much we crave that invitation

We've since created a civic seminary

to start training people from all over to lead Civic Saturday gatherings

on their own in their own towns

In the community of Athens Tennessee

a feisty leader named Whitney Kimball Coe
Whitney Kimball Coe
leads hers in an art and framing shop

with a youth choir and lots of little flags

A young activist named Berto Aguayo

led his Civic Saturday on a street corner

in the Back of the Yards neighborhood of Chicago

Berto was once involved with gangs

Now he's keeping the peace

and organizing political campaigns

In Honolulu Rafael Bergstrom

a former pro baseball player turned photographer and conservationist

leads his under the banner Civics IS Sexy

It is

Laughter

Sometimes I'm asked even by our seminarians

Isn't it dangerous to use religious language

Won't that just make our politics even more dogmatic and selfrighteous

But this view assumes that all religion is fanatical fundamentalism

It is not

Religion is also moral discernment

an embrace of doubt

a commitment to detach from self and serve others

a challenge to repair the world

In this sense politics could stand to be a little more like religion

not less

Thus my final topic today

why civic religion matters now

I want to offer two reasons

One is to counter the culture of hyperindividualism

Every message we get from every screen and surface

of the modern marketplace

is that each of us is on our own

a free agent

free to manage our own brands

free to live under bridges

free to have side hustles

free to die alone without insurance

Market liberalism tells us we are masters beholden to none

but then it enslaves us

in the awful isolation of consumerism and status anxiety

Audience Yeah

Millions of us are on to the con now

We are realizing now

that a freeforall is not the same as freedom for all

Applause

What truly makes us free is being bound to others

in mutual aid and obligation

having to work things out the best we can in our neighborhoods and towns

as if our fates were entwined 

because they are 

as if we could not secede from one another

because in the end we cannot

Binding ourselves this way actually liberates us

It reveals that we are equal in dignity

It reminds us that rights come with responsibilities

It reminds us in fact

that rights properly understood are responsibilities

The second reason why civic religion matters now

is that it offers the healthiest possible story of us and them

We talk about identity politics today as if it were something new

but it's not

All politics is identity politics

a neverending struggle to define who truly belongs

Instead of noxious myths of blood and soil that mark some as forever outsiders

civic religion offers everyone a path to belonging

based only a universal creed of contribution participation

inclusion

In civic religion the us is those who wish to serve

volunteer vote listen learn empathize argue better

circulate power rather than hoard it

The them is those who don't

It is possible to judge the them harshly

but it isn't necessary

for at any time one of them can become one of us

simply by choosing to live like a citizen

So let's welcome them in

Whitney and Berto and Rafael are gifted welcomers

Each has a distinctive locally rooted way

to make faith in democracy relatable to others

Their slang might be Appalachian or South Side or Hawaiian

Their message is the same

civic love civic spirit civic responsibility

Now you might think that all this civic religion stuff

is just for overzealous secondgeneration Americans like me

But actually it is for anyone anywhere

who wants to kindle the bonds of trust

affection and joint action

needed to govern ourselves in freedom

Now maybe Civic Saturdays aren't for you

That's OK

Find your own ways to foster civic habits of the heart

Many forms of beloved civic community are thriving now

in this age of awakening

Groups like Community Organizing Japan

which uses creative performative rituals of storytelling

to promote equality for women

In Iceland civil confirmations

where young people are led by an elder

to learn the history and civic traditions of their society

culminating in a riteofpassage ceremony

akin to church confirmation

Ben Franklin Circles in the United States

where friends meet monthly

to discuss and reflect upon the virtues that Franklin codified

in his autobiography

like justice and gratitude and forgiveness

I know civic religion is not enough

to remedy the radical inequities of our age

We need power for that

But power without character is a cure worse than the disease

I know civic religion alone can't fix corrupt institutions

but institutional reforms without new norms will not last

Culture is upstream of law

Spirit is upstream of policy

The soul is upstream of the state

We cannot unpollute our politics if we clean only downstream

We must get to the source

The source is our values

and on the topic of values my advice is simple have some

Laughter

Applause

Make sure those values are prosocial

Put them into practice

and do so in the company of others

with a structure of creed deed and joyful ritual

that'll keep all of you coming back

Those of us who believe in democracy and believe it is still possible

we have the burden of proving it

But remember it is no burden at all

to be in a community where you are seen as fully human

where you have a say in the things that affect you

where you don't need to be connected to be respected

That is called a blessing

and it is available to all who believe

Thank you

Applause

Chris Anderson What worries you right now

You've been very open about lots of issues on Twitter

What would be your top worry

about where things are right now

Jack Dorsey Right now the health of the conversation

So our purpose is to serve the public conversation

and we have seen a number of attacks on it

We've seen abuse we've seen harassment

we've seen manipulation

automation human coordination misinformation

So these are all dynamics that we were not expecting

 years ago when we were starting the company

But we do now see them at scale

and what worries me most is just our ability to address it

in a systemic way that is scalable

that has a rigorous understanding of how we're taking action

a transparent understanding of how we're taking action

and a rigorous appeals process for when we're wrong

because we will be wrong

Whitney Pennington Rodgers I'm really glad to hear

that that's something that concerns you

because I think there's been a lot written about people

who feel they've been abused and harassed on Twitter

and I think no one more so than women and women of color

and black women

And there's been data that's come out 

Amnesty International put out a report a few months ago

where they showed that a subset of active black female Twitter users

were receiving on average one in  of their tweets

were some form of harassment

And so when you think about health for the community on Twitter

I'm interested to hear health for everyone

but specifically How are you looking to make Twitter a safe space
Twitter
for that subset for women for women of color and black women

JD Yeah
JD
So it's a pretty terrible situation

when you're coming to a service

that ideally you want to learn something about the world

and you spend the majority of your time reporting abuse receiving abuse

receiving harassment

So what we're looking most deeply at is just the incentives

that the platform naturally provides and the service provides

Right now the dynamic of the system makes it supereasy to harass

and to abuse others through the service

and unfortunately the majority of our system in the past

worked entirely based on people reporting harassment and abuse

So about midway last year we decided that we were going to apply

a lot more machine learning a lot more deep learning to the problem

and try to be a lot more proactive around where abuse is happening

so that we can take the burden off the victim completely

And we've made some progress recently

About  percent of abusive tweets are now proactively identified

by machine learning algorithms

so that people don't actually have to report them

But those that are identified are still reviewed by humans

so we do not take down content or accounts without a human actually reviewing it

But that was from zero percent just a year ago

So that meant at that zero percent

every single person who received abuse had to actually report it

which was a lot of work for them a lot of work for us

and just ultimately unfair

The other thing that we're doing is making sure that we as a company

have representation of all the communities that we're trying to serve

We can't build a business that is successful

unless we have a diversity of perspective inside of our walls

that actually feel these issues every single day

And that's not just with the team that's doing the work

it's also within our leadership as well

So we need to continue to build empathy for what people are experiencing

and give them better tools to act on it

and also give our customers a much better and easier approach

to handle some of the things that they're seeing

So a lot of what we're doing is around technology

but we're also looking at the incentives on the service

What does Twitter incentivize you to do when you first open it up
Twitter
And in the past

it's incented a lot of outrage it's incented a lot of mob behavior

it's incented a lot of group harassment

And we have to look a lot deeper at some of the fundamentals

of what the service is doing to make the bigger shifts

We can make a bunch of small shifts around technology as I just described

but ultimately we have to look deeply at the dynamics in the network itself

and that's what we're doing

CA But what's your sense 
CA
what is the kind of thing that you might be able to change

that would actually fundamentally shift behavior

JD Well one of the things 
JD
we started the service with this concept of following an account

as an example

and I don't believe that's why people actually come to Twitter
Twitter
I believe Twitter is best as an interestbased network
Twitter
People come with a particular interest

They have to do a ton of work to find and follow the related accounts

around those interests

What we could do instead is allow you to follow an interest

follow a hashtag follow a trend
hashtag
follow a community

which gives us the opportunity to show all of the accounts

all the topics all the moments all the hashtags

that are associated with that particular topic and interest

which really opens up the perspective that you see

But that is a huge fundamental shift

to bias the entire network away from just an account bias

towards a topics and interest bias

CA Because isn't it the case
CA
that one reason why you have so much content on there

is a result of putting millions of people around the world

in this kind of gladiatorial contest with each other

for followers for attention

Like from the point of view of people who just read Twitter

that's not an issue

but for the people who actually create it everyone's out there saying

You know I wish I had a few more 'likes' followers retweets

And so they're constantly experimenting

trying to find the path to do that

And what we've all discovered is that the number one path to do that

is to be some form of provocative

obnoxious eloquently obnoxious

like eloquent insults are a dream on Twitter

where you rapidly pile up 

and it becomes this selffueling process of driving outrage

How do you defuse that

JD Yeah I mean I think you're spot on
JD
but that goes back to the incentives

Like one of the choices we made in the early days was

we had this number that showed how many people follow you

We decided that number should be big and bold

and anything that's on the page that's big and bold has importance

and those are the things that you want to drive

Was that the right decision at the time

Probably not

If I had to start the service again

I would not emphasize the follower count as much

I would not emphasize the like count as much

I don't think I would even create like in the first place

because it doesn't actually push

what we believe now to be the most important thing

which is healthy contribution back to the network

and conversation to the network

participation within conversation

learning something from the conversation

Those are not things that we thought of  years ago

and we believe are extremely important right now

So we have to look at how we display the follower count

how we display retweet count
retweet
how we display likes

and just ask the deep question

Is this really the number that we want people to drive up

Is this the thing that when you open Twitter

you see That's the thing I need to increase

And I don't believe that's the case right now

Applause

WPR I think we should look at some of the tweets
WPR
that are coming in from the audience as well

CA Let's see what you guys are asking
CA
I mean this is  generally one of the amazing things about Twitter

is how you can use it for crowd wisdom

you know that more knowledge more questions more points of view

than you can imagine

and sometimes many of them are really healthy

WPR I think one I saw that passed already quickly down here
WPR
What's Twitter's plan to combat foreign meddling in the  US election
Twitter
I think that's something that's an issue we're seeing

on the internet in general

that we have a lot of malicious automated activity happening

And on Twitter for example in fact we have some work
Twitter
that's come from our friends at Zignal Labs
Zignal
and maybe we can even see that to give us an example

of what exactly I'm talking about

where you have these bots if you will

or coordinated automated malicious account activity

that is being used to influence things like elections

And in this example we have from Zignal which they've shared with us
Zignal
using the data that they have from Twitter

you actually see that in this case

white represents the humans  human accounts each dot is an account

The pinker it is

the more automated the activity is

And you can see how you have a few humans interacting with bots

In this case it's related to the election in Israel

and spreading misinformation about Benny Gantz

and as we know in the end that was an election

that Netanyahu won by a slim margin

and that may have been in some case influenced by this

And when you think about that happening on Twitter

what are the things that you're doing specifically

to ensure you don't have misinformation like this spreading in this way

influencing people in ways that could affect democracy

JD Just to back up a bit
JD
we asked ourselves a question

Can we actually measure the health of a conversation

and what does that mean

And in the same way that you have indicators

and we have indicators as humans in terms of are we healthy or not

such as temperature the flushness of your face

we believe that we could find the indicators of conversational health

And we worked with a lab called Cortico at MIT
Cortico
to propose four starter indicators

that we believe we could ultimately measure on the system

And the first one is what we're calling shared attention

It's a measure of how much of the conversation is attentive

on the same topic versus disparate

The second one is called shared reality

and this is what percentage of the conversation

shares the same facts 

not whether those facts are truthful or not

but are we sharing the same facts as we converse

The third is receptivity

How much of the conversation is receptive or civil

or the inverse toxic

And then the fourth is variety of perspective

So are we seeing filter bubbles or echo chambers

or are we actually getting a variety of opinions

within the conversation

And implicit in all four of these is the understanding that

as they increase the conversation gets healthier and healthier

So our first step is to see if we can measure these online

which we believe we can

We have the most momentum around receptivity

We have a toxicity score a toxicity model on our system

that can actually measure whether you are likely to walk away

from a conversation that you're having on Twitter

because you feel it's toxic

with some pretty high degree

We're working to measure the rest

and the next step is

as we build up solutions

to watch how these measurements trend over time

and continue to experiment

And our goal is to make sure that these are balanced

because if you increase one you might decrease another

If you increase variety of perspective

you might actually decrease shared reality

CA Just picking up on some of the questions flooding in here
CA
JD Constant questioning
JD
CA A lot of people are puzzled why
CA
like how hard is it to get rid of Nazis from Twitter

JD Laughs
JD
So we have policies around violent extremist groups

and the majority of our work and our terms of service

works on conduct not content

So we're actually looking for conduct

Conduct being using the service

to repeatedly or episodically harass someone

using hateful imagery

that might be associated with the KKK
KKK
or the American Nazi Party

Those are all things that we act on immediately

We're in a situation right now where that term is used fairly loosely

and we just cannot take any one mention of that word

accusing someone else

as a factual indication that they should be removed from the platform

So a lot of our models are based around number one

Is this account associated with a violent extremist group

And if so we can take action

And we have done so on the KKK and the American Nazi Party and others
KKK
And number two Are they using imagery or conduct

that would associate them as such as well

CA How many people do you have working on content moderation
CA
to look at this

JD It varies
JD
We want to be flexible on this

because we want to make sure that we're number one

building algorithms instead of just hiring massive amounts of people

because we need to make sure that this is scalable

and there are no amount of people that can actually scale this

So this is why we've done so much work around proactive detection of abuse

that humans can then review

We want to have a situation

where algorithms are constantly scouring every single tweet

and bringing the most interesting ones to the top

so that humans can bring their judgment to whether we should take action or not

based on our terms of service

WPR But there's not an amount of people that are scalable
WPR
but how many people do you currently have monitoring these accounts

and how do you figure out what's enough

JD They're completely flexible
JD
Sometimes we associate folks with spam

Sometimes we associate folks with abuse and harassment

We're going to make sure that we have flexibility in our people

so that we can direct them at what is most needed

Sometimes the elections

We've had a string of elections in Mexico one coming up in India

obviously the election last year the midterm election

so we just want to be flexible with our resources

So when people 

just as an example if you go to our current terms of service

and you bring the page up

and you're wondering about abuse and harassment that you just received

and whether it was against our terms of service to report it

the first thing you see when you open that page

is around intellectual property protection

You scroll down and you get to abuse harassment

and everything else that you might be experiencing

So I don't know how that happened over the company's history

but we put that above the thing that people want

the most information on and to actually act on

And just our ordering shows the world what we believed was important

So we're changing all that

We're ordering it the right way

but we're also simplifying the rules so that they're humanreadable

so that people can actually understand themselves

when something is against our terms and when something is not

And then we're making 

again our big focus is on removing the burden of work from the victims

So that means push more towards technology

rather than humans doing the work 

that means the humans receiving the abuse

and also the humans having to review that work

So we want to make sure

that we're not just encouraging more work

around something that's super super negative

and we want to have a good balance between the technology

and where humans can actually be creative

which is the judgment of the rules

and not just all the mechanical stuff of finding and reporting them

So that's how we think about it

CA I'm curious to dig in more about what you said
CA
I mean I love that you said you are looking for ways

to retweak the fundamental design of the system

to discourage some of the reactive behavior and perhaps 

to use Tristan Harristype language 

engage people's more reflective thinking

How far advanced is that

What would alternatives to that like button be

JD Well first and foremost
JD
my personal goal with the service is that I believe fundamentally

that public conversation is critical

There are existential problems facing the world

that are facing the entire world not any one particular nationstate

that global public conversation benefits

And that is one of the unique dynamics of Twitter
Twitter
that it is completely open

it is completely public

it is completely fluid

and anyone can see any other conversation and participate in it

So there are conversations like climate change

There are conversations like the displacement in the work

through artificial intelligence

There are conversations like economic disparity

No matter what any one nationstate does

they will not be able to solve the problem alone

It takes coordination around the world

and that's where I think Twitter can play a part
Twitter
The second thing is that Twitter right now when you go to it
Twitter
you don't necessarily walk away feeling like you learned something

Some people do

Some people have a very very rich network

a very rich community that they learn from every single day

But it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to build up to that

So we want to get people to those topics and those interests

much much faster

and make sure that they're finding something that

no matter how much time they spend on Twitter 

and I don't want to maximize the time on Twitter

I want to maximize what they actually take away from it

and what they learn from it and 

CA Well do you though
CA
Because that's the core question that a lot of people want to know

Surely Jack you're constrained to a huge extent

by the fact that you're a public company

you've got investors pressing on you

the number one way you make your money is from advertising 

that depends on user engagement

Are you willing to sacrifice user time if need be

to go for a more reflective conversation

JD Yeah more relevance means less time on the service
JD 
and that's perfectly fine

because we want to make sure that like you're coming to Twitter

and you see something immediately that you learn from and that you push

We can still serve an ad against that

That doesn't mean you need to spend any more time to see more

The second thing we're looking at 

CA But just  on that goal daily active usage
CA
if you're measuring that that doesn't necessarily mean things

that people value every day

It may well mean

things that people are drawn to like a moth to the flame every day

We are addicted because we see something that pisses us off

so we go in and add fuel to the fire

and the daily active usage goes up

and there's more ad revenue there

but we all get angrier with each other

How do you define 

Daily active usage seems like a really dangerous term to be optimizing

Applause

JD Taken alone it is
JD
but you didn't let me finish the other metric

which is we're watching for conversations

and conversation chains

So we want to incentivize healthy contribution back to the network

and what we believe that is is actually participating in conversation

that is healthy

as defined by those four indicators I articulated earlier

So you can't just optimize around one metric

You have to balance and look constantly

at what is actually going to create a healthy contribution to the network

and a healthy experience for people

Ultimately we want to get to a metric

where people can tell us Hey I learned something from Twitter

and I'm walking away with something valuable

That is our goal ultimately over time

but that's going to take some time

CA You come over to many I think to me as this enigma
CA
This is possibly unfair but I woke up the other night

with this picture of how I found I was thinking about you and the situation

that we're on this great voyage with you on this ship called the Twittanic 
Twittanic
Laughter

and there are people on board in steerage

who are expressing discomfort

and you unlike many other captains

are saying Well tell me talk to me listen to me I want to hear

And they talk to you and they say We're worried about the iceberg ahead

And you go You know that is a powerful point

and our ship frankly hasn't been built properly

for steering as well as it might

And we say Please do something

And you go to the bridge

and we're waiting

and we look and then you're showing this extraordinary calm

but we're all standing outside saying Jack turn the fucking wheel

You know

Laughter

Applause

I mean 

Applause

It's democracy at stake

It's our culture at stake It's our world at stake

And Twitter is amazing and shapes so much

It's not as big as some of the other platforms

but the people of influence use it to set the agenda

and it's just hard to imagine a more important role in the world than to 

I mean you're doing a brilliant job of listening Jack and hearing people

but to actually dial up the urgency and move on this stuff 

will you do that

JD Yes and we have been moving substantially
JD
I mean there's been a few dynamics in Twitter's history

One when I came back to the company

we were in a pretty dire state in terms of our future

and not just from how people were using the platform

but from a corporate narrative as well

So we had to fix a bunch of the foundation

turn the company around

go through two crazy layoffs

because we just got too big for what we were doing

and we focused all of our energy

on this concept of serving the public conversation

And that took some work

And as we dived into that

we realized some of the issues with the fundamentals

We could do a bunch of superficial things to address what you're talking about

but we need the changes to last

and that means going really really deep

and paying attention to what we started  years ago

and really questioning

how the system works and how the framework works

and what is needed for the world today

given how quickly everything is moving and how people are using it

So we are working as quickly as we can but quickness will not get the job done

It's focus it's prioritization

it's understanding the fundamentals of the network

and building a framework that scales

and that is resilient to change

and being open about where we are and being transparent about where are

so that we can continue to earn trust

So I'm proud of all the frameworks that we've put in place

I'm proud of our direction

We obviously can move faster

but that required just stopping a bunch of stupid stuff we were doing in the past

CA All right
CA
Well I suspect there are many people here who if given the chance

would love to help you on this changemaking agenda you're on

and I don't know if Whitney 

Jack thank you for coming here and speaking so openly

It took courage

I really appreciate what you said and good luck with your mission

JD Thank you so much Thanks for having me
JD
Applause

Thank you

Translator Leslie Gauthier Reviewer Joanna Pietrulewicz
Leslie Gauthier ReviewerJoanna Pietrulewicz
So I have a confession to make

I only recently learned how to drive

And it was really hard

Now this wasn't an older brain thing

Do you remember what it was like when you first learned how to drive

When every decision you made was so conscious and deliberate

I'd come home from my lessons completely wiped out mentally

Now as a cognitive scientist I know that this is because I was using

a lot of something called executive function

Executive function is our amazing ability to consciously control our thoughts

emotions and actions

in order to achieve goals 

like learning how to drive

It's what we use when we need to break away from habit

inhibit our impulses and plan ahead

But we can see it most clearly when things go wrong

Like have you ever accidentally poured orange juice on your cereal

Laughter

Or ever start scrolling on Facebook
Facebook
and suddenly realize you've missed a meeting

Laughter

Or maybe this one's more familiar

Ever plan to stop at the store on the way home from work

and then drive all the way home instead on autopilot

Laughter

These things happen to everyone

And we usually call it absentmindedness

but what's really happening

is we're experiencing a lapse in executive function

So we use executive function every day in all aspects of our lives

And over the past  years

researchers have found that it predicts all kinds of good things

in childhood and beyond

like social skills academic achievement mental and physical health

making money saving money

and even staying out of jail

Sounds great doesn't it

So it's no surprise

that researchers like me are so interested in understanding it

and figuring out ways to improve it

But lately executive function has become a huge selfimprovement buzzword

People think you can improve it through braintraining iPhone apps
iPhone
and computer games

or by practicing it in a specific way like playing chess

And researchers are trying to train it in the lab

in the hopes of improving it and other things related to it

like intelligence

Well I'm here to tell you

that this way of thinking about executive function is all wrong

Brain training won't improve executive function in a broad sense

because it involves exercising it in a narrow way

outside of the realworld contexts in which we actually use it

So you can master that executive function app on your phone

but that's not going to help you stop pouring OJ on your Cheeerios twice a week

Laughter

If you really want to improve your executive function

in a way that matters for your life

you have to understand how it's influenced by context

Let me show you what I mean

There's a great test that we use in the lab

to measure executive function in young children

called the dimensional change card sort

In this task kids have to sort cards in one way 

like by shape 

over and over until they build up a habit

And then they're asked to switch

and sort the same cards in another way

like by color

Now really young kids struggle with this

Three and fouryearolds will usually keep sorting the cards in the old way

no matter how many times you remind them of what they should be doing

Video Woman If it's blue put it here If it's red put it here

Here's a blue one

OK so now we're going to play a different game

We're not going to play the color game anymore

Now we're going to play the shape game

and in the shape game

all the stars go here and all the trucks go here OK

Stars go here trucks go here

Where do the stars go

And where do the trucks go

Excellent

OK stars go here trucks go here

Here's a truck

Laughter

Stars go here trucks go here

Here's a star

Laughter

SB So it's really compelling
SB
and it's really obvious when she fails to use her executive function

But here's the thing

we could train her on this task and others like it

and eventually she'd improve

but does that mean

that she would've improved her executive function outside of the lab

No because in the real world she'll need to use executive function

to do a lot more than switching between shape and color

She'll need to switch from adding to multiplying

or from playing to tidying up

or from thinking about her own feelings to thinking about her friend

And success in realworld situations depends on things

like how motivated you are and what your peers are doing

And it also depends on the strategies that you execute

when you're using executive function in a particular situation

So what I'm saying is that context really matters

Now let me give you an example from my research

I recently brought in a bunch of kids to do the classic marshmallow test

which is a measure of delay of gratification

that also likely requires a lot of executive function

So you may have heard about this test

but basically kids are given a choice

They can have one marshmallow right away

or if they can wait for me to go to the other room

and get more marshmallows

they can have two instead

Now most kids really want that second marshmallow

but the key question is How long can they wait

Laughter

Now I added a twist to look at the effects of context

I told each kid that they were in a group

like the green group

and I even gave them a green Tshirt to wear
T
And I said Your group waited for two marshmallows

and this other group the orange group

did not

Or I said the opposite

Your group didn't wait for two marshmallows

and this other group did

And then I left the kid alone in the room

and I watched on a webcam to see how long they waited

Laughter

So what I found was that kids who believed

that their group waited for two marshmallows

were themselves more likely to wait

So they were influenced by a peer group that they'd never even met

Laughter

Pretty cool isn't it

Well so with this result I still didn't know

if they were just copying their group or if it was something deeper than that

So I brought in some more kids

and after the marshmallow test I showed them pictures of pairs of kids

and I told them One of these kids likes to have things right away

like cookies and stickers

And the other kid likes to wait

so that they can have more of these things

And then I asked them

Which one of these two kids do you like more

and who would you want to play with

And what I found was that kids who believed that their group waited

tended to prefer other kids who liked to wait for things

So learning what their group did made them value waiting more

And not only that

these kids likely used executive function

to generate strategies to help themselves wait

like sitting on their hands or turning away from the marshmallow

or singing a song to distract themselves

Laughter

So what this all shows is just how much context matters

It's not that these kids had good executive function or bad

it's that the context helped them use it better

So what does this mean for you and for your kids

Well let's say that you want to learn Spanish

You could try changing your context

and surrounding yourself with other people who also want to learn

and even better if these are people that you really like

That way you'll be more motivated to use executive function

Or let's say that you want to help your child do better on her math homework

You could teach her strategies to use executive function

in that particular context

like putting her phone away before she starts studying

or planning to reward herself after studying for an hour

Now I don't want to make it sound like context is everything

Executive function is really complex and it's shaped by numerous factors

But what I want you to remember

is if you want to improve your executive function

in some aspect of your life

don't look for quick fixes

Think about the context

and how you can make your goals matter more to you

and how you can use strategies

to help yourself in that particular situation

I think the ancient Greeks said it best when they said Know thyself

And a key part of this is knowing how context shapes your behavior

and how you can use that knowledge to change for the better

Thank you

Applause

Chris Anderson Shep thank you so much for coming

I think your plane landed literally two hours ago in Vancouver

Such a treat to have you

So talk us through how do you get from Einstein's equation to a black hole

Sheperd Doeleman Over  years ago

Einstein came up with this geometric theory of gravity

which deforms spacetime

So matter deforms spacetime

and then spacetime tells matter in turn how to move around it

And you can get enough matter into a small enough region

that it punctures spacetime

and that even light can't escape

the force of gravity keeps even light inside

CA And so before that the reason the Earth moves around the Sun
CA
is not because the Sun is pulling the Earth as we think

but it's literally changed the shape of space

so that we just sort of fall around the Sun

SD Exactly the geometry of spacetime
SD
tells the Earth how to move around the Sun

You're almost seeing a black hole puncture through spacetime

and when it goes so deeply in

then there's a point at which light orbits the black hole

CA And so that's I guess is what's happening here
CA
This is not an image

this is a computer simulation of what we always thought

like the event horizon around the black hole

SD Until last week we had no idea what a black hole really looked like
SD
The best we could do were simulations like this in supercomputers

but even here you see this ring of light

which is the orbit of photons

That's where photons literally move around the black hole

and around that is this hot gas that's drawn to the black hole

and it's hot because of friction

All this gas is trying to get into a very small volume so it heats up

CA A few years ago you embarked on this mission
CA
to try and actually image one of these things

And I guess you took 

you focused on this galaxy way out there

Tell us about this galaxy

SD This is the galaxy 
SD
we're going to zoom into the galaxy M it's  million lightyears away
M
CA Fiftyfive million
CA
SD Which is a long way
SD
And at its heart

there's a sixandahalfbillion solarmass black hole

That's hard for us to really fathom right

Six and a half billion suns compressed into a single point

And it's governing some of the energetics of the center of this galaxy

CA But even though that thing is so huge because it's so far away
CA
to actually dream of getting an image of it

that's incredibly hard

The resolution would be incredible that you need

SD Black holes are the smallest objects in the known universe

But they have these outsize effects on whole galaxies

But to see one

you would need to build a telescope as large as the Earth

because the black hole that we're looking at

gives off copious radio waves

It's emitting all the time

CA And that's exactly what you did
CA
SD Exactly What you're seeing here
SD
is we used telescopes all around the world

we synchronized them perfectly with atomic clocks

so they received the light waves from this black hole

and then we stitched all of that data together to make an image

CA To do that
CA
the weather had to be right

in all of those locations at the same time

so you could actually get a clear view

SD We had to get lucky in a lot of different ways
SD
And sometimes it's better to be lucky than good

In this case we were both I like to think

But light had to come from the black hole

It had to come through intergalactic space

through the Earth's atmosphere where water vapor can absorb it

and everything worked out perfectly

the size of the Earth at that wavelength of light

one millimeter wavelength

was just right to resolve that black hole  million lightyears away

The universe was telling us what to do

CA So you started capturing huge amounts of data
CA
I think this is like half the data from just one telescope

SD Yeah this is one of the members of our team Lindy Blackburn
SD
and he's sitting with half the data

recorded at the Large Millimeter Telescope

which is atop a foot mountain in Mexico

And what he's holding there is about half a petabyte

Which to put it in terms that we might understand

it's about  people's lifetime selfie budget

Laughter

CA It's a lot of data
CA
So this was all shipped you couldn't send this over the internet

All this data was shipped to one place

and the massive computer effort began to try and analyze it

And you didn't really know

what you were going to see coming out of this

SD The way this technique works that we used 
SD
imagine taking an optical mirror and smashing it

and putting all the shards in different places

The way a normal mirror works

is the light rays bounce off the surface which is perfect

and they focus in a certain point at the same time

We take all these recordings

and with atomic clock precision

we align them perfectly later in a supercomputer

And we recreate kind of an Earthsized lens

And the only way to do that is to bring the data back by plane

You can't beat the bandwidth of a  filled with hard discs

Laughter

CA And so I guess a few weeks or a few months ago
CA
on a computer screen somewhere

this started to come into view

This moment

SD Well it took a long time
SD
CA I mean look at this
CA
That was it

That was the first image

Applause

So tell us what we're really looking at there

SD I still love it
SD
Laughter

So what you're seeing is that last orbit of photons

You're seeing Einstein's geometry laid bare

The puncture in spacetime is so deep

that light moves around in orbit

so that light behind the black hole as I think we'll see soon

moves around and comes to us on these parallel lines

at exactly that orbit

It turns out that orbit is the square root of 

times just a handful of fundamental constants

It's extraordinary when you think about it

CA When 
CA
In my head initially when I thought of black holes

I'm thinking that is the event horizon

there's lots of matter and light whirling around in that shape

But it's actually more complicated than that

Well talk us through this animation because it's light being lensed around it

SD You'll see here that some light from behind it gets lensed
SD
and some light does a looptheloop around the entire orbit of the black hole

But when you get enough light

from all this hot gas swirling around the black hole

then you wind up seeing all of these light rays

come together on this screen

which is a standin for where you and I are

And you see the definition of this ring begin to come into shape

And that's what Einstein predicted over  years ago

CA Yeah that is amazing
CA
So tell us more about what we're actually looking at here

First of all why is part of it brighter than the rest

SD So what's happening is that the black hole is spinning
SD
And you wind up with some of the gas moving towards us below

and receding from us on the top

And just as the train whistle has a higher pitch

when it's coming towards you

there's more energy from the gas coming towards us than going away from us

You see the bottom part brighter

because the light is actually being boosted in our direction

CA And how physically big is that
CA
SD Our entire solar system would fit well within that dark region
SD
And if I may

that dark region is the signature of the event horizon

The reason we don't see light from there

is that the light that would come to us from that place

was swallowed by the event horizon

So that  that's it

CA And so when we think of a black hole
CA
you think of these huge rays jetting out of it

which are pointed directly in our direction

Why don't we see them

SD This is a very powerful black hole
SD
Not by universal standards it's still powerful

and from the north and south poles of this black hole

we think that jets are coming

Now we're too close to really see all the jet structure

but it's the base of those jets that are illuminating the spacetime

And that's what's being bent around the black hole

CA And if you were in a spaceship whirling around that thing somehow
CA
how long would it take to actually go around it

SD First I would give anything to be in that spaceship
SD
Laughter

Sign me up

Theres something called the  if I can get wonky for one moment 

the innermost stable circular orbit

that's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole

before it spirals in

And for this black hole it's going to be between three days and about a month

CA It's so powerful it's weirdly slow at one level
CA
I mean you wouldn't even notice

falling into that event horizon if you were there

SD So you may have heard of spaghettification

where you fall into a black hole

and the gravitational field on your feet is much stronger than on your head

so you're ripped apart

This black hole is so big

that you're not going to become a spaghetti noodle

You're just going to drift right through that event horizon

CA So it's like a giant tornado
CA
When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado she ended up in Oz

Where do you end up if you fall into a black hole

Laughter

SD Vancouver
SD
Laughter

CA Oh my God
CA
Applause

It's the red circle that's terrifying

No really

SD Black holes really are the central mystery of our age
SD
because that's where the quantum world and the gravitational world come together

What's inside is a singularity

And that's where all the forces become unified

because gravity finally is strong enough to compete with all the other forces

But it's hidden from us

the universe has cloaked it in the ultimate invisibility cloak

So we don't know what happens in there

CA So there's a smaller one of these in our own galaxy
CA
Can we go back to our own beautiful galaxy

This is the Milky Way this is home

And somewhere in the middle of that there's another one

which you're trying to find as well

SD We already know it's there and we've already taken data on it
SD
And we're working on those data right now

So we hope to have something in the near future I can't say when

CA It's way closer but also a lot smaller
CA
maybe the similar kind of size to what we saw

SD Right So it turns out that the black hole in M
SDM
that we saw before

is six and a half billion solar masses

But it's so far away that it appears a certain size

The black hole in the center of our galaxy is a thousand times less massive

but also a thousand times closer

So it looks the same angular size on the sky

CA Finally I guess a nod to a remarkable group of people
CA
Who are these guys

SD So these are only some of the team
SD
We marveled at the resonance that this image has had

If you told me that it would be above the fold in all of these newspapers

I'm not sure I would have believed you but it was

Because this is a great mystery

and it's inspiring for us and I hope it's inspiring to everyone

But the more important thing is that this is just a small number of the team

We're  people strong with  institutes

and  countries and regions

If you want to build a global telescope you need a global team

And this technique that we use of linking telescopes around the world

kind of effortlessly sidesteps some of the issues that divide us

And as scientists we naturally come together to do something like this

CA Wow boy that's inspiring for our whole team this week
CA
Shep thank you so much for what you did and for coming here

SD Thank you
SD
Applause

These are sequences from a play called The Lehman Trilogy

which traces the origins of Western capitalism

in three hours

with three actors and a piano

And my role was to create a stage design

to write a visual language for this work

The play describes Atlantic crossings

Alabama cotton fields

New York skylines

and we framed the whole thing within this single revolving cube

a kind of kinetic cinema through the centuries

It's like a musical instrument

played by three performers

And as they step their way around and through

the lives of the Lehman brothers

we the audience

begin to connect with the simple human origins

at the root of the complex global financial systems

that we're all still in thrall to today

I used to play musical instruments myself when I was younger

My favorite was the violin

It was this intimate transfer of energy

You held this organic sculpture up to your heart

and you poured the energy of your whole body

into this little piece of wood and heard it translated into music

And I was never particularly good at the violin

but I used to sit at the back of the second violin section

in the Hastings Youth Orchestra

scratching away

We were all scratching

and marveling at this symphonic sound that we were making

that was so much more beautiful and powerful

than anything we would ever have managed on our own

And now as I create largescale performances

I am always working with teams

that are at least the size of a symphony orchestra

And whether we are creating

these revolving giant chess piece time tunnels

for an opera by Richard Wagner

or shark tanks and mountains for Kanye West

we're always seeking to create the most articulate sculpture

the most poetic instrument of communication to an audience

When I say poetic

I just mean language at its most condensed

like a song lyric

a poetic puzzle to be unlocked and unpacked

And when we were preparing to design Beyonc's Formation tour

we looked at all the lyrics

and we came across this poem that Beyonc wrote

I saw a TV preacher when I was scared at four or five about bad dreams

who promised he'd say a prayer if I put my hand to the TV

That's the first time I remember prayer an electric current running through me

And this TV that transmitted prayer to Beyonc as a child

became this monolithic revolving sculpture

that broadcast Beyonc to the back of the stadium

And the stadium is a mass congregation

It's a temporary population of a hundred thousand people

who have all come there to sing along with every word together

but they've also come there each seeking onetoone intimacy

with the performer

And we as we conceive the show we have to provide intimacy

on a grand scale

It usually starts with sketches

I was drawing this foothigh revolving

broadcastquality portrait of the artist

and then I tore the piece of paper in half

I split the mask

to try to access the human underneath it all

And it's one thing to do sketches but of course translating from a sketch

into a tourable revolving sixstory building

took some exceptional engineers working around the clock for three months

until finally we arrived in Miami

and opened the show in April 

Video Cheers

Music Formation Beyonc
Beyonc 
Beyonc Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess

Paparazzi catch my fly and my cocky fresh

I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress

I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces

My daddy Alabama

Momma Louisiana

You mix that negro with that Creole

make a Texas bama

Music ends

I call my work 

Cheers applause

Thank you

Cheers applause

I call my work stage sculpture

but of course what's really being sculpted is the experience of the audience

and as directors and designers

we have to take responsibility

for every minute that the audience spend with us

We're a bit like pilots

navigating a flight path for a hundred thousand passengers

And in the case of the Canadian artist The Weeknd
The Weeknd
we translated this flight path literally

into an origami paper folding airplane

that took off over the heads of the audience

broke apart in midflight complications

and then rose out of the ashes restored

at the end of the show

And like any flight

the most delicate part is the liftoff the beginning

because when you design a pop concert

the prime material that you're working with

is something that doesn't take trucks or crew to transport it

It doesn't cost anything

and yet it fills every atom of air in the arena before the show starts

It's the audience's anticipation

Everyone brings with them the story of how they came to get there

the distances they traveled

the months they had to work to pay for the tickets

Sometimes they sleep overnight outside the arena

and our first task is to deliver for an audience on their anticipation

to deliver their first sight of the performer

When I work with men

they're quite happy to have their music transformed into metaphor 

spaceflights mountains

But with women we work a lot with masks and with threedimensional portraiture

because the fans of the female artist

crave her face

And when the audience arrived to see Adele's first live concert in five years

they were met with this image of her eyes asleep

If they listened carefully

they would hear her sleeping breath echoing around the arena

waiting to wake up

Here's how the show began

Video Cheers applause

Music

Adele Hello

Cheers applause

Es Devlin With U we're navigating the audience
U
over a terrain that spans three decades of politics poetry and music

And over many months meeting with the band and their creative teams

this is the sketch that kept recurring

this line this street

the street that connects the band's past with their present

the tightrope that they walk as activists and artists

a walk through cinema

that allows the band to become protagonists

in their own poetry

Music U's Where the Streets Have No Name
U
Bono I wanna run

I want to hide

I wanna tear down the walls

That hold me inside

Es Devlin The end of the show is like the end of a flight

It's an arrival

It's a transfer from the stage out to the audience

For the British band Take That

we ended the show by sending an foot high mechanical human figure

out to the center of the crowd

Music

Like many translations from music to mechanics

this one was initially deemed entirely technically impossible

The first three engineers we took it to said no

and eventually the way that it was achieved

was by keeping the entire control system together

while it toured around the country

so we had to fold it up onto a flatbed truck

so it could tour around without coming apart

And of course what this meant was that the dimension of its head

was entirely determined

by the lowest motorway bridge that it had to travel under on its tour

And I have to tell you that it turns out

there is an unavoidable and annoyingly low bridge

low bridge just outside Hamburg

Laughter

Music

Another of the most technically complex pieces that we've worked on

is the opera Carmen

at Bregenz Festival in Austria

We envisaged Carmen's hands rising out of Lake Constance

and throwing this deck of cards in the air

and leaving them suspended between sky and sea

But this transient gesture this flick of the wrists

had to become a structure that would be strong enough

to withstand two Austrian winters

So there's an awful lot that you don't see in this photograph

that's working really hard

It's a lot of ballast and structure and support around the back

and I'm going to show you the photos that aren't on my website

They're photos of the back of a set

the part that's not designed for the audience to see

however much work it's doing

And you know this is actually the dilemma

for an artist who is working as a stage designer

because so much of what I make is fake

it's an illusion

And yet every artist works in pursuit of communicating something that's true

But we are always asking ourselves

Can we communicate truth using things that are false

And now when I attend the shows that I've worked on

I often find I'm the only one who is not looking at the stage

I'm looking at something that I find equally fascinating

and it's the audience

Cheers

I mean where else do you witness this

Cheers

this many humans connected focused

undistracted and unfragmented

And lately I've begun to make work that originates here

in the collective voice of the audience

Poem Portraits is a collective poem

It began at the Serpentine Gallery in London

and everybody is invited to donate one word to a collective poem

And instead of that large single LED portrait
LED
that was broadcasting to the back of the stadium

in this case every member of the audience

gets to take their own portrait home with them

and it's woven in with the words

that they've contributed to the collective poem

So they keep a fragment of an everevolving collective work

And next year the collective poem will take architectural form

This is the design for the UK Pavilion at the World Expo 

The UK 

In my lifetime it's never felt this divided

It's never felt this noisy with divergent voices

And it's never felt this much in need of places

where voices might connect and converge

And it's my hope that this wooden sculpture

this wooden instrument a bit like that violin I used to play

might be a place where people can play and enter their word

at one end of the cone

emerge at the other end of the building

and find that their word has joined a collective poem a collective voice

Music

These are simple experiments in machine learning

The algorithm that generates the collective poem is pretty simple

It's like predictive text

only it's trained on millions of words written by poets in the th century

So it's a sort of convergence of intelligence past and present

organic and inorganic

And we were inspired by the words of Stephen Hawking

Towards the end of his life he asked quite a simple question

If we as a species were ever to come across another advanced lifeform

an advanced civilization

how would we speak to them

What collective language would we speak as a planet

The language of light reaches every audience

All of us are touched by it None of us can hold it

And in the theater we begin each work in a dark place devoid of light

We stay up all night focusing the lights programming the lights

trying to find new ways to sculpt and carve light

Music

This is a portrait of our practice

always seeking new ways to shape and reshape light

always finding words for things that we no longer need to say

And I want to say that this

and everything that I've just shown you

no longer exists in physical form

Music

In fact most of what I've made over the last  years

doesn't exist anymore

But our work endures in memories in synaptic sculptures

in the minds of those who were once present

in the audience

Music

I once read that a poem learnt by heart

is what you have left

what can't be lost

even if your house burns down and you've lost all your possessions

I want to end with some lines that I learnt by heart a long time ago

Music

They're written by the English novelist EM Forster
EM
in  just a few years before Europe my continent

Music

began tearing itself apart

Music

And his call to convergence still resonates

through most of what we're trying to make now

Music

Only connect That was the whole of her sermon
 
Only connect the prose and the passion

and both will be exalted

And human love will be seen at its height

Only connect And live in fragments no longer
 
Thank you

On the red tiles in my family's den

I would dance and sing to the madeforTV movie Gypsy

starring Bette Midler

Singing I had a dream

A wonderful dream papa

I would sing it with the urgency and the burning desire of a nineyearold

who did in fact have a dream

My dream was to be an actress

And it's true that I never saw anyone who looked like me

in television or in films

and sure my family and friends and teachers all constantly warned me

that people like me didn't make it in Hollywood

But I was an American

I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything

regardless of the color of their skin

the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras

the fact that I had no money

I didn't need my dream to be easy

I just needed it to be possible

And when I was 

I got my first professional audition

It was a commercial for cable subscriptions

or bail bonds I don't really remember

Laughter

What I do remember is that the casting director asked me

Could you do that again but just this time sound more Latina

Um OK

So you want me to do it in Spanish I asked
 
No no do it in English just sound Latina

Well I am a Latina so isn't this what a Latina sounds like

There was a long and awkward silence

and then finally

OK sweetie never mind thank you for coming in bye

It took me most of the car ride home to realize that by sound more Latina

she was asking me to speak in broken English

And I couldn't figure out why the fact

that I was an actual reallife authentic Latina

didn't really seem to matter

Anyway I didn't get the job

I didn't get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for

the gangbanger's girlfriend

the sassy shoplifter

pregnant chola number two

Laughter

These were the kinds of roles that existed for someone like me

Someone they looked at and saw as too brown too fat

too poor too unsophisticated

These roles were stereotypes

and couldn't have been further from my own reality

or from the roles I dreamt of playing

I wanted to play people who were complex and multidimensional

people who existed in the center of their own lives

Not cardboard cutouts that stood in the background of someone else's

But when I dared to say that to my manager 

that's the person I pay to help me find opportunity 

his response was

Someone has to tell that girl she has unrealistic expectations

And he wasn't wrong

I mean I fired him but he wasn't wrong

Laughter

Applause

Because whenever I did try to get a role that wasn't a poorly written stereotype

I would hear

We're not looking to cast this role diversely

Or We love her but she's too specifically ethnic

Or Unfortunately we already have one Latino in this movie

I kept receiving the same message again and again and again

That my identity was an obstacle I had to overcome

And so I thought

Come at me obstacle

I'm an American My name is America

I trained my whole life for this I'll just follow the playbook

I'll work harder

And so I did I worked my hardest

to overcome all the things that people said were wrong with me

I stayed out of the sun so that my skin wouldn't get too brown

I straightened my curls into submission

I constantly tried to lose weight

I bought fancier and more expensive clothes

All so that when people looked at me

they wouldn't see a too fat too brown too poor Latina

They would see what I was capable of

And maybe they would give me a chance

And in an ironic twist of fate

when I finally did get a role that would make all my dreams come true

it was a role that required me to be exactly who I was

Ana in Real Women Have Curves

was a brown poor fat Latina

I had never seen anyone like her anyone like me

existing in the center of her own life story

I traveled throughout the US

and to multiple countries with this film

where people regardless of their age ethnicity body type

saw themselves in Ana

A yearold chubby Mexican American girl

struggling against cultural norms to fulfill her unlikely dream

In spite of what I had been told my whole life

I saw firsthand that people actually did want to see stories about people like me

And that my unrealistic expectations

to see myself authentically represented in the culture

were other peoples expectations too

Real Women Have Curves

was a critical cultural and financial success

Great I thought We did it

We proved our stories have value

Things are going to change now

But I watched as very little happened

There was no watershed

No one in the industry was rushing to tell more stories

about the audience that was hungry and willing to pay to see them

Four years later when I got to play Ugly Betty

I saw the same phenomenon play out

Ugly Betty premiered in the US to  million viewers

and was nominated for  Emmys in its first year

Applause

But in spite of Ugly Betty's success

there would not be another television show

led by a Latina actress

on American television for eight years

It's been  years

since I became the first and only Latina

to ever win an Emmy in a lead category

That is not a point of pride

That is a point of deep frustration

Not because awards prove our worth

but because who we see thriving in the world

teaches us how to see ourselves

how to think about our own value

how to dream about our futures

And anytime I begin to doubt that

I remember that there was a little girl living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan

And somehow she got her hands on some DVDs
DVD
of an American television show

in which she saw her own dream of becoming a writer reflected

In her autobiography Malala wrote

I had become interested in journalism

after seeing how my own words could make a difference

and also from watching the Ugly Betty DVDs
DVD
about life at an American magazine

Applause

For  years of my career

I have witnessed the power our voices have

when they can access presence in the culture

I've seen it

I've lived it we've all seen it

In entertainment in politics

in business in social change

We cannot deny it  presence creates possibility

But for the last  years

I've also heard the same excuses

for why some of us can access presence in the culture

and some of us can't

Our stories don't have an audience

our experiences won't resonate in the mainstream

our voices are too big a financial risk

Just a few years ago my agent called

to explain to me why I wasn't getting a role in a movie

He said They loved you

and they really really do want to cast diversely

but the movie isn't financeable until they cast the white role first

He delivered the message with a broken heart

and with a tone that communicated I understand how messed up this is

But nonetheless just like hundreds of times before

I felt the tears roll down my face

And the pang of rejection rise up in me

and then the voice of shame scolding me

You are a grown woman stop crying over a job

I went through this process for years of accepting the failure as my own

and then feeling deep shame that I couldn't overcome the obstacles

But this time I heard a new voice

A voice that said I'm tired

I've had enough

A voice that understood

my tears and my pain were not about losing a job

They were about what was actually being said about me

What had been said about me my whole life

by executives and producers

and directors and writers and agents and managers

and teachers and friends and family

That I was a person of less value

I thought sunscreen and straightening irons

would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system

But what I realized in that moment

was that I was never actually asking the system to change

I was asking it to let me in and those aren't the same thing

I couldn't change what a system believed about me

while I believed what the system believed about me

And I did

I like everyone around me

believed that it wasn't possible for me to exist in my dream as I was

And I went about trying to make myself invisible

What this revealed to me was that it is possible

to be the person who genuinely wants to see change

while also being the person whose actions keep things the way they are

And what it's led me to believe is that change isn't going to come

by identifying the good guys and the bad guys

That conversation lets us all off the hook

Because most of us are neither one of those

Change will come

when each of us has the courage

to question our own fundamental values and beliefs

And then see to it that our actions lead to our best intentions

I am just one of millions of people

who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams

in order to contribute my talents to the world

I have to resist the truth of who I am

I for one am ready to stop resisting

and to start existing as my full and authentic self

If I could go back and say anything

to that nineyearold dancing in the den dreaming her dreams

I would say

my identity is not my obstacle

My identity is my superpower

Because the truth is

I am what the world looks like

You are what the world looks like

Collectively we are what the world actually looks like

And in order for our systems to reflect that

they don't have to create a new reality

They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in

Thank you

Applause

My day starts just like yours

Laughter

When I wake up in the morning

I check my phone

and then I have a cup of coffee

But then my day truly starts

It may not be like yours because I live my life as an artwork

Picture yourself in a giant jewelry box

with all the beautiful things that you have ever seen in your life

Then imagine that your body is a canvas

And on that canvas

you have a mission to create a masterpiece

using the contents of your giant jewelry box

Once you've created your masterpiece

you might think Wow I created that

This is who I am today

Then you would pick up your house keys

walk out the door into the real world

maybe take public transport to the center of the town 

Possibly walk along the streets or even go shopping

That's my life every day

When I walk out the door

these artworks are me

I am art

I have lived as art my entire adult life

Living as art is how I became myself

I was brought up in a small village called Fillongley in England

and it was last mentioned in the Domesday Book

so that's the mentality

Laughter

I was raised by my grandparents

and they were antiques dealers

so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things

I had the most amazing dressup box

So as you can imagine it started then

I moved to London when I was  to become a model

And then I went to study photography

I wasn't really happy with myself at the time

so I was always looking for escapism

I studied the works of David LaChapelle

and Steven Arnold

photographers who both curated and created worlds

that were mindblowing to me

So I decided one day to cross over from the superficial fashion world

to the superficial art world

Laughter

I decided to live my life as a work of art

I spend hours sometimes months making things

My goto tool is a safety pin like this 

Laughter

They're never big enough

Laughter

And I use my fabrics time and time again

so I recycle everything that I use

When I get dressed I'm guided by color texture and shape

I rarely have a theme

I find beautiful objects from all over the world

and I curate them into D tapestries

over a base layer that covers my whole body shape 

because I'm not very happy with my body

Laughs

I ask myself Should I take something off

or should I put something on

 pieces maybe

And sometimes I do that

I promise you it's not too uncomfortable 

well just a little 

Laughter

I might have a safety pin poking at me sometimes

when I'm having a conversation with you

so I'll kind of go off 

Laughter

It usually takes me about  minutes to get ready

which nobody ever believes

It's true 

sometimes

So it's my version of a tshirt and jeans
T
Laughter

When I get dressed I build like an architect

I carefully place things till I feel they belong

Then I get a lot of my ideas from lucid dreaming

I actually go to sleep to come up with my ideas

and I've taught myself to wake up to write them down

I wear things till they fall apart

and then I give them a new life

The gold outfit for example 

it was the outfit that I wore to the Houses of Parliament in London

It's made of armor sequins and broken jewelry

and I was the first person to wear armor to Parliament

since Oliver Cromwell banned it in the th century

Things don't need to be expensive to be beautiful

Try making outfits out of bin liners or trash you found out on the streets

You never know

they might end up on the pages of Vogue
Vogue
There's over  pieces in my collection

ranging from yearold Roman rings to ancient Buddhist artifacts

I believe in sharing what I do and what I have with others

so I decided to create an art exhibition

which is currently traveling to museums around the world

It contains an army of me 

lifesize sculptures as you can see behind me

they're here 

they are my life really

They're kind of like D tapestries of my existence as living as art

They contain plastic crystals mixed with diamonds

beer cans and royal silks all in one look

I like the fact that the viewer can never make the assumption

about what's real and what's fake

I find it important to explore and share cultures through my works

I use clothing as a means to investigate

and appreciate people from all over the world

Sometimes people think I'm a performer or a drag queen

I'm not

Although my life appears to be a performance

it's not

It's very real

People respond to me as they would any other type of artwork

Many people are fascinated and engaged

Some people walk around me staring shy at first

Then they come up to me and they say they love or absolutely hate what I do

I sometimes respond and other times I let the art talk for itself

The most annoying thing in the world is when people want to touch the artwork

But I understand

But like a lot of contemporary art

many people are dismissive

Some people are critical

others are abusive

I think it comes from the fear of the different 

the unknown

There are so many reactions to what I do

and I've just learned not to take them personally

I've never lived as Daniel Lismore the person

I've lived as Daniel Lismore the artwork

And I've faced every obstacle as an artwork

It can be hard 

especially if your wardrobe takes up a foot container

three storage units and  boxes from IKEA 
IKEA
Laughter

and sometimes it can be very difficult getting into cars

and sometimes 

well this morning I didn't fit through my bathroom door

so that was a problem

Laughter

What does it mean to be yourself

People say it all the time

but what does it truly mean

and why does it matter

How does life change when you choose to be unapologetically yourself

I've had to face struggles and triumphs whilst living my life as art

I've been put on private jets

and flown around the world

My work's been displayed in prestigious museums

and I've had the opportunity 

that is my grandparents by the way

they're the people that raised me

and there I am 

Laughs

Applause

So I've been put on private jets flown around the world

and yet it's not been that easy

because at times I've been homeless

I've been spat at

I've been abused sometimes daily

bullied my entire life

rejected by countless individuals

and I've been stabbed

But what hurt the most

was being put on the Worst Dressed list

Laughter

It can be hard being yourself

but I've found it's the best way

There's the Worst Dressed

Laughs

As the quote goes Everyone else is already taken

I've come to realize that confidence is a concept you can choose

I've come to realize that authenticity is necessary and it's powerful

I've tried to spend time being like other people

It didn't work

It's a lot of hard work not being yourself

I have a few questions for you all

Who are you

How many versions of you are there

And I have one final question

Are you using them all to your advantage

In reality everyone is capable of creating their own masterpiece

You should try it sometime

It's quite fun

Thank you

Applause and cheers

Thank you very much

Well I would like to start with testicles

Laughter

Men who sleep five hours a night

have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more

Laughter

In addition men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night

will have a level of testosterone

which is that of someone  years their senior

So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade

in terms of that critical aspect of wellness

And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health

caused by a lack of sleep

This is the best news that I have for you today

Laughter

From this point it may only get worse

Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things

that happen when you get sleep

but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough

both for your brain and for your body

Let me start with the brain

and the functions of learning and memory

because what we've discovered over the past  or so years

is that you need sleep after learning

to essentially hit the save button on those new memories

so that you don't forget

But recently we discovered that you also need sleep before learning

to actually prepare your brain

almost like a dry sponge

ready to initially soak up new information

And without sleep the memory circuits of the brain

essentially become waterlogged as it were

and you can't absorb new memories

So let me show you the data

Here in this study we decided to test the hypothesis

that pulling the allnighter was a good idea

So we took a group of individuals

and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups

a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group

Now the sleep group they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber

but the deprivation group we're going to keep them awake

in the laboratory under full supervision

There's no naps or caffeine by the way so it's miserable for everyone involved

And then the next day

we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner

and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts

as we're taking snapshots of brain activity

And then we're going to test them

to see how effective that learning has been

And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis

And when you put those two groups head to head

what you find is a quite significant percent deficit

in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep

I think this should be concerning

considering what we know is happening to sleep

in our education populations right now

In fact to put that in context

it would be the difference in a child acing an exam

versus failing it miserably   percent

And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain

to produce these types of learning disabilities

And there's a structure that sits

on the left and the right side of your brain called the hippocampus

And you can think of the hippocampus

almost like the informational inbox of your brain

It's very good at receiving new memory files

and then holding on to them

And when you look at this structure

in those people who'd had a full night of sleep

we saw lots of healthy learningrelated activity

Yet in those people who were sleepdeprived

we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever

So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox

and any new incoming files  they were just being bounced

You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory

So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you

but let me just come back to that control group for a second

Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep

Well we can ask a very different question

What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep

when you do get it

that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability

each and every day

And by placing electrodes all over the head

what we've discovered is that there are big powerful brainwaves

that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep

that have riding on top of them

these spectacular bursts of electrical activity

that we call sleep spindles

And it's the combined quality of these deepsleep brainwaves

that acts like a filetransfer mechanism at night

shifting memories from a shortterm vulnerable reservoir

to a more permanent longterm storage site within the brain

and therefore protecting them making them safe

And it is important that we understand

what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits

because there are real medical and societal implications

And let me just tell you about one area

that we've moved this work out into clinically

which is the context of aging and dementia

Because it's of course no secret that as we get older

our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline

But what we've also discovered

is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse

especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing

And only last year we finally published evidence

that these two things they're not simply cooccurring

they are significantly interrelated

And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep

is an underappreciated factor

that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline

in aging and most recently we've discovered

in Alzheimer's disease as well

Now I know this is remarkably depressing news

It's in the mail It's coming at you

But there's a potential silver lining here

Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging

for example changes in the physical structure of the brain

that's fiendishly difficult to treat

But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle

of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting

because we may be able to do something about it

And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center

is not by using sleeping pills by the way

Unfortunately they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep

Instead we're actually developing a method based on this

It's called direct current brain stimulation

You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain

so small you typically don't feel it

but it has a measurable impact

Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young healthy adults

as if you're sort of singing in time with those deepsleep brainwaves

not only can you amplify the size of those deepsleep brainwaves

but in doing so we can almost double the amount of memory benefit

that you get from sleep

The question now is whether we can translate

this same affordable potentially portable piece of technology

into older adults and those with dementia

Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep

and in doing so can we salvage aspects of their learning

and memory function

That is my real hope now

That's one of our moonshot goals as it were

So that's an example of sleep for your brain

but sleep is just as essential for your body

We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system

Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system

and that all it takes is one hour

Because there is a global experiment performed on  billion people

across  countries twice a year

and it's called daylight saving time

Now in the spring when we lose one hour of sleep

we see a subsequent percent increase in heart attacks that following day

In the autumn when we gain an hour of sleep

we see a percent reduction in heart attacks

Isn't that incredible

And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes road traffic accidents

even suicide rates

But as a deeper dive I want to focus on this

sleep loss and your immune system

And here I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image

They are called natural killer cells

and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents

of your immune system

They are very good at identifying dangerous unwanted elements

and eliminating them

In fact what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass

So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins

at all times

and tragically that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough

So here in this experiment

you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night

you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours

for one single night

and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction

in immune cell activity that you suffer

And it's not small  it's not  percent

it's not  percent

There was a percent drop in natural killer cell activity

That's a concerning state of immune deficiency

and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding

significant links between short sleep duration

and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer

Currently that list includes cancer of the bowel

cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast

In fact the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong

that the World Health Organization

has classified any form of nighttime shift work

as a probable carcinogen

because of a disruption of your sleepwake rhythms

So you may have heard of that old maxim

that you can sleep when you're dead

Well I'm being quite serious now 

it is mortally unwise advice

We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals

There's a simple truth

the shorter your sleep the shorter your life

Short sleep predicts allcause mortality

And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer

or even Alzheimer's disease

were not sufficiently disquieting

we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode

the very fabric of biological life itself

your DNA genetic code
DNA
So here in this study they took a group of healthy adults

and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night

for one week

and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile

relative to when those same individuals

were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night

And there were two critical findings

First a sizable and significant  genes

were distorted in their activity

caused by a lack of sleep

The second result was that about half of those genes

were actually increased in their activity

The other half were decreased

Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep

were genes associated with your immune system

so once again you can see that immune deficiency

In contrast those genes that were actually upregulated

or increased by way of a lack of sleep

were genes associated with the promotion of tumors

genes associated with longterm chronic inflammation within the body

and genes associated with stress

and as a consequence cardiovascular disease

There is simply no aspect of your wellness

that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation

and get away unscathed

It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home

Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny

of your physiology

even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet
DNA
that spells out your daily health narrative

And at this point you may be thinking

Oh my goodness how do I start to get better sleep

What are you tips for good sleep

Well beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact

of alcohol and caffeine on sleep

and if you're struggling with sleep at night

avoiding naps during the day

I have two pieces of advice for you

The first is regularity

Go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time

no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend

Regularity is king

and it will anchor your sleep

and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep

The second is keep it cool

Your body needs to drop its core temperature

by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep

and then to stay asleep

and it's the reason you will always find it easier

to fall asleep in a room that's too cold

than too hot

So aim for a bedroom temperature of around  degrees

or about  degrees Celsius

That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people

And then finally in taking a step back then

what is the missioncritical statement here

Well I think it may be this

sleep unfortunately is not an optional lifestyle luxury

Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity

It is your lifesupport system

and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality

And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations

is having a catastrophic impact on our health our wellness

even the safety and the education of our children

It's a silent sleep loss epidemic

and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges

that we face in the st century

I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right

to a full night of sleep

and without embarrassment

or that unfortunate stigma of laziness

And in doing so we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life

the Swiss Army knife of health as it were

And with that soapbox rant over

I will simply say good night good luck

and above all 

I do hope you sleep well
I do hope you sleep well
Thank you very much indeed

Applause

Thank you

Applause

Thank you so much

David Biello No no no Stay there for a second

Good job not running away though I appreciate that

So that was terrifying

Matt Walker You're welcome DB Yes thank you thank you
 DB
Since we can't catch up on sleep what are we supposed to do

What do we do when we're like tossing and turning in bed late at night

or doing shift work or whatever else

MW So you're right we can't catch up on sleep

Sleep is not like the bank

You can't accumulate a debt

and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time

I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic

and that our health deteriorates so quickly

first it's because human beings are the only species

that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep

for no apparent reason

DB Because we're smart
DB
MW And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature
MW
throughout the course of evolution

has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation

So she's never developed a safety net

and that's why when you undersleep

things just sort of implode so quickly both within the brain and the body

So you just have to prioritize

DB OK but tossing and turning in bed
DB
what do I do

MW So if you are staying in bed awake for too long
MW
you should get out of bed and go to a different room

and do something different

The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom

with the place of wakefulness

and you need to break that association

So only return to bed when you are sleepy

and that way you will relearn the association that you once had

which is your bed is the place of sleep

So the analogy would be

you'd never sit at the dinner table waiting to get hungry

so why would you lie in bed waiting to get sleepy

DB Well thank you for that wakeup call
DB
Great job Matt

MW You're very welcome Thank you very much
MW
Hello

Well I'm here to talk to you about my animal muse

the sloth

Laughter

I've been documenting the strange lives of the world's slowest mammal

for the last  years

I still remember the first time I saw one

I was fascinated by their freaky biology

I mean what's not to love about an animal that's born

with a fixed grin on its face

Laughter

And the need to hug

Audience Awww

But sloths are massively misunderstood

They've been saddled with a name that speaks of sin

and damned for their languorous lifestyle

which people seem to think has no place amongst the fittest

in the fastpaced race for survival

Well I'm here to tell you that we've got this animal all wrong 

and how understanding the truth about the sloth

may help save us and this planet we both call home

I traced slothbased slander

back to a Spanish conquistador called Valds

who gave the first description of a sloth in his encyclopedia of the New World

He said the sloth was

the stupidest animal that can be found in the world 

I have never seen such an ugly animal or one that is more useless

Laughter

Tell us what you really think Valds

Laughter

I'd like to have a word about Valds's drawing skills

Laughter

I mean what is that

Laughter

I've never seen an illustration of a sloth that's more useless

Laughter

But I mean on the plus side

he has given the sloth a remarkably humanlike face

and sloths do have remarkably humanlike faces

This sloth I photographed in Costa Rica I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr

Laughter

But then sloths do bear an uncanny resemblance to the The Beatles

Laughter

Particularly pleased with Paul actually on there

But like The Beatles sloths are also extremely successful

They come from an ancient line of mammals and there were once dozens of species

including the giant ground sloth which was the size of a small elephant

and one of the only animals big enough to eat avocado pits whole

and disperse them

So  Laughter

Some of you have worked it out already

Laughter

That means that without sloths

there might be no avocado on toast today

leaving hipsters everywhere totally bereft at breakfast

Laughter

Applause

Today there are six surviving species and they fall into two groups

You've got your Bradypus threetoed sloths

they're the ones with the Beatles haircuts and the Mona Lisa smiles

Then there are the twotoed sloths

They look a little bit more like a cross between a Wookiee and a pig

They live in the jungles of Central and South America

and they're extremely prolific

There was a survey that was done in the s

in a Panamanian tropical forest

that found that sloths were the most numerically abundant large animal

They took up one quarter of the mammalian biomass

Now that's an awful lot of sloths

and suggests they're doing something very right indeed

So what if rather than deriding the sloth for being different

we tried to learn from it instead

We humans are obsessed with speed

Busyness is a badge of honor

and convenience trumps quality in our quest for quick

Our addiction to the express life is choking us and the planet

We idolize animals like the cheetah the Ferrari of the animal kingdom

capable of doing naught to  in three seconds flat

Well so what

Laughter

Applause

So what

The sloth on the other hand

can reach a leisurely  feet a minute

with the wind behind it

Laughter

But being fast is costly

The cheetah is speedy but at the expense of strength

They can't risk getting in a fight

so they lose one in nine kills to tougher predators like hyenas

No wonder they're laughing

Laughter

The sloth on the other hand

has taken a more stealthy approach to dinner

They survive by capturing and consuming

static leaves

Laughter

But you see leaves don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do

so they're loaded full of toxins and very hard to digest

So in order to consume them

the sloth has also had to become an athlete 

a digesting athlete

Laughter

The sloth's secret weapon is a fourchambered stomach

and plenty of time

They have the slowest digestion rate of any mammal

And it can take up to a month to process a single leaf

which gives their liver plenty of time to process those toxins

So sloths aren't lazy

No they're busy

Digesting

Laughter

Yeah really busy

Laughter

Hard at work that sloth very hard at work

And of course leaves have little calorific value

so sloths have evolved to spend as little energy as possible

They do about  percent of the work of a similarsized mammal

and survive on as little as  calories a day

thanks to some ingenious adaptations

The Bradypus threetoed sloths

they've got more neck bones than any other mammal

even a giraffe

Which means they can turn their head through  degrees

and graze all around them

without having to actually bother with the effort of moving their body

Laughter

It also means that they are surprisingly good swimmers

Sloths can bob along in water

three times faster than they can move on land

kept afloat by 

trapped wind

Laughter

So 

Laughter

sloths are the only mammal that we know of that don't do flatulence

When they need to expel gas

it's actually reabsorbed into their bloodstream

and expelled orally as a sort of mouth fart

Laughter

Turning their lives upside down saves further energy

They have about half the skeletal muscle of a terrestrial mammal

They don't really have so many of the extensor muscles

that are the weightbearing muscles

instead they rely on retractor muscles to pull themselves along

They have long hooked claws and a high fatigue resistance

so they can literally hook on and hang like a happy hairy hammock

for hours on end

And sloths can do almost anything in this inverted position

They sleep eat and even give birth

Their throat and blood vessels are uniquely adapted

to pump blood and to swallow food against the force of gravity

They have sticky bits on their ribs

that prevent their enormous stomach from crushing their lungs

And their fur grows the opposite direction

so they can drip dry after a tropical drenching

The only problem is if you turn a sloth the other way up

gravity removes its dignity

Audience Awww

They can't hold themselves upright

And so they drag their bodies along as if mountaineering on a flat surface

And I think this is why the early explorers like Valds

thought so poorly of them

because they were observing sloths the wrong way up and out of context

I've spent many happy hours mesmerized by moving sloths

Their lack of muscle hasn't impeded their strength or agility

Nature's zen masters of mellow move like Swan Lake in slow mo 

Laughter

with the core control of a tai chi master

This one has fallen asleep midmove which is not uncommon

Laughter

But you're probably wondering

How does a dangling bag of digesting leaves avoid being eaten

Good question

Well this is one of the sloth's main predators

It's the harpy eagle

It can fly at speeds of up to  miles per hour

has talons the size of a grizzly bear's

razorsharp eyesight

and that ring of feathers focuses sound

so that it can hear the slightest leaf rustle

The sloth on the other hand has poor hearing bad eyesight

and running from danger is clearly not an option

No they survive by wearing an invisibility cloak

worthy of Harry Potter

Their fur has grooves that attract moisture

and act as tiny hydroponic gardens for algae

and they also attract a host of invertebrates

So they are their own slowmoving miniature ecosystem

They become one with the trees

And we think that their movements are so slow

they slip under the radar of the monstrous harpy
harpy
as it's flying about the canopy scanning for action

Sloths are stealth ninjas

and they rarely leave the safety of the canopy 

except to defecate

which they do about once a week at the base of a tree

Now this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery

and there are lots of theories as to why they do it

But I think they're leaving surreptitious scented messages for potential mates

Because you see sloths are generally silent solitary creatures

except for when the female is in heat

She will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex

In Dsharp
Dsharp
Laughter

Don't believe me

Sound of sloth scream

Dsharp
Dsharp
This and only this note will get the male's attention

It mimics the sound of the kiskadee flycatcher
kiskadee
So the female remains covert

even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs

Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy

and males will beat a slow path towards her

Laughter

I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree

so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one

Sex by the way is the only thing that sloths do swiftly

I've seen them do it in the wild

and it's over and done with in a matter of seconds

But then why waste precious energy on it

particularly after that journey

Laughter

Unlike other mammals

sloths don't also waste time maintaining a constant warm body temperature

Energy from the sun is free

so they bask in the sun like lizards

and wear an unusually thick coat for the tropics to keep that heat in

Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism

And we think that this might be one of the reasons

that they can sometimes recover from injuries

that would kill most animals

This sloth recovered from a double amputation

and I've known sloths that have managed to survive

even power line electrocutions

And we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction

Researchers at Kansas University who were studying mollusks

found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk

had gone extinct

Sloths have been around on this planet in one shape or another

for over  million years

The secret to their success is their slothful nature

They are energysaving icons

And I founded the Sloth Appreciation Society

to both promote and protect their slow steady sustainable lives

I'm a pretty speedy character

I'm sure you've guessed

And the sloths have taught me a lot about slowing down

And I think that the planet would benefit

if we all took a slowly digested leaf out of their book

How about we all embrace our inner sloth

by slowing down

being more mindful

reducing wasteful convenience

being economical with our energy

recycling creatively

and reconnecting with nature

Otherwise I fear

it will be us humans that turn out to be

the stupidest animals that can be found in the world

Thank you very much

May the sloth be with you

Applause

A cold January day of 

I took one of my most important drives of my life

I was on this road in upstate New York

trying to find this old factory

The day before I received a flyer in the mail

that said Fully equipped yogurt plant for sale

I threw it in the garbage can

And  minutes later I picked it up and called the number

The plant was  years old

and it was closing

So I decided to go see it

At this time

I wasn't sure where this road or my life was going

I owned a small cheese shop

but really hated business

But the hills and the roads and the smells are all familiar

I grew up in Turkey in a similar environment

near the Kurdish mountains

My family made cheese and yogurt

I grew up listening to shepherd's stories

We didn't have much

but we had the moon and the stars simple food each other

Eventually I came to America

I didn't even know New York had farms

I made it to upstate and I never left

Now I'm lost

I passed the road sign that said Dead end

Then soon after

there it was

the factory

The smell hit me first

It was a like a milk container left out in the sun

The walls were so thick

paints were peeling there were cracks everywhere

The factory was so old the owners thought it was worthless

I thought they left a zero off

I couldn't believe the price

As I entered in

I stopped noticing things

All I could see were the people

There were  of them

Just quiet

Their only job was to break the plant apart

and close it forever

I was met with a guy named Rich

the production manager

He offered to take me around show me around

He didn't say much

but around every corner he would point out some stories

Rich worked there for  years

His father made yogurt before him

and his grandfather made cream cheese before that

You could tell that Rich felt guilty

that this factory was closing on his watch

What hit me the hardest at that time

was that this wasn't just an old factory

This was a time machine

This is where people built lives they left for wars

they bragged about home runs and report cards

But now it was closing

And the company wasn't just giving up on yogurt

it was giving up on them

As if they were not good enough

And I was shocked how these people were behaving

There was no anger there were no tears

Just silence

With grace they were closing this factory

I was so angry

that the CEO was far away

in a tower or somewhere

looking at the spreadsheets

and closing the factory

Spreadsheets are lazy

They don't tell you about people they don't tell you about communities

But unfortunately

this is how too many business decisions are made today

I was never the same person after what I saw

On my way back home I called Mario my lawyer

I called Mario I said Mario I want to buy this place

Mario said

Hamdi one of the largest food companies in the world is closing this place

and they're getting out of the yogurt business

Who the hell are you to make it work

I said You're right

But the next day I called him again

and I said Mario really I really want to buy this place

He said Hamdi you have no money

Laughter

You haven't even paid me in six months

Laughter

Which was true

Laughter

But I got a loan another loan

By August  I had the keys for this factory

The first thing I did was to hire four of the original  people

I had Maria the office manager

I had Frank the wastewater guy

I had Mike the maintenance guy

And Rich who showed me the plant the production guy
Rich
And we had our first board meeting

Mike says Hamdi what are we going to do now

They look at me as if I have the magic answer

So I said Mike

we're going to go to Ace Hardware store
Ace
and we're going to get some paints

And we're going to paint the walls outside

Mike wasn't impressed

He looked at me

He said Hamdi that's fine well do that

but tell me you have more ideas than that

Laughter

I said I do

We'll paint the walls white

Laughter

Honest to God that was the only idea I had

Laughter

But we painted those walls that summer

I sometimes wonder

what they would have said to me if I told them

See these walls we're painting

In two years

we're going to launch a yogurt here

that Americans have never seen and never tasted before

It will be delicious it will be natural

And we're going to call it 'Chobani'  it means 'shepherd' in Turkish
Chobani
And if I said

We are going to hire all of the  employees back

or most of them back

And then  more after and then  more after

and then  more after that

But if I told them You see that town over there

Every person we hire  more local jobs will be created

The town will come back to life the trucks will be all over the roads

And the first money we make

we're going to build one of the best Little League baseball fields

for our children

And five years after that

we're going to be the number one Greek yogurt brand in the country

Would they have believed me

Of course not

But that's exactly what happened

Applause

In painting those walls

we got to know each other

We believed in each other

And we figured it out together

Five years me and all my colleagues we never left the factory

We worked day and night through the holidays

to fix that plant

The best part of Chobani for me is this

the same exact people who were given up on

were the ones who built it back  times better than before

And they all have a financial stake in the company today

Applause

And all this time I kept wondering 

you see I'm not a businessman I don't come from that tradition 

I just kept wondering What is this all about

Corporate America says it's about profits

Mainstream business says it's about money

The CEO playbook says it's about shareholders

And so much is sacrificed for it  it's factories communities jobs

But not by CEOs

CEOs have their employees suffer for them

But yet the CEOs's pay goes up and up and up
CEO
And so many people are left behind

I'm here to tell you

no more

It's not right it's never been right

It's time to admit

that the playbook that guided businesses and CEOs for the last  years

is broken

Applause

It tells you everything about business

except how to be a noble leader

We need a new playbook

We need a new playbook that sees people again

That sees above and beyond profits

In the movies they have a name for people who take a different path

to do things right

They call them antiheroes

I think we need the same idea in business

We need antiCEOs and we need an antiCEO playbook

So let me tell you about what this antiCEO playbook is all about

An antiCEO playbook is about gratitude

Today's business book says

business exists to maximize profit for the shareholders

I think that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life

Laughter

In reality business should take care of their employees first

Applause

You know a few years ago

when we announced that we are giving shares to all our  employees

some people said it's PR some said it's a gift

I said it's not a gift

I watched it I've been part of it

They earned it with their talent and with their hard work

and I don't see any other way

The new way of business 

it's your employees you take care of first

Not the profits

The new antiCEO playbook is about community
CEO
Today the businesses that have it all

ask communities What kind of tax breaks and incentives can you give me

The reality is businesses should go to the struggling communities

and ask How can I help you

Applause

When we wanted to build our second yogurt plant

Idaho was on nobody's radar screen

It was too rural too far away didn't have much incentives

So I went there

I met with the local people I met with the farmers

We shook hands we broke bread

I said I want to build it right here

I don't need to see financial studies

And the result 

its community is thriving

There's new schools that open every year

New food companies are coming up every year

And they told me

You're not going to find any trained workers here

I said It's OK we'll teach them

We partnered with the local community college

and while we were building the plant

we trained hundreds of hundreds of people for advanced manufacturing

And today our factory is one of the largest yogurt plants in the world

Applause

The new way of business 

communities

Go search for communities that you can be part of

Ask for permission

And be with them open the walls and succeed together

The antiCEO playbook is about responsibility

Today's playbook says the businesses should stay out of politics

The reality is

businesses as citizens must take a side

When we were growing in New York and looking for more people to hire

I remembered that in Utica an hour away

there were refugees from Southeast Asia and Africa

who were looking for a place to work

They don't speak English someone told me

I said I don't really either Let's get translators

Laughter

They don't have transportation

I said Let's get buses it's not a rocket science

Today

in one of America's rural areas

 percent of the Chobani workforce are immigrants and refugees

Applause Cheers

And it changed us for better

The new way of business 

it's business not government in the best position to make a change

in today's world

in gun violence in climate change

in income inequality in refugees in race

It's business that must take a side

Applause

And lastly an antiCEO playbook is about accountability
CEO
Today's playbook says the CEO reports to the corporate boards

In my opinion CEO reports to consumer
CEO
In the first few years of Chobani

the  number on the cup was my personal number

Laughter

When somebody called and wrote I responded personally

Sometimes I made changes based on what I heard

because consumer is in power

That's the reason the business exists

It's you  every single one of you is in power to make changes today

If you don't like the brand and the companies

what they are doing with their business

you can throw them into the garbage can

And if you see the ones that are doing it right

you can reward them

In the end this is all in our responsibility

The new way of business 

it's the consumer we report to not to the corporate boards

You see

if you are right with your people

if you are right with your community

if you are right with your product

you will be more profitable

you will be more innovative

you will have more passionate people working for you

and a community that supports you

And that's what the antiCEO playbook is all about

The treasure that I found in that factory 

dignity of work

strength of character

human spirit 

is what we need to unleash all across the world

Brothers and sisters

there are people and places all around the world

left out and left behind

But their spirit is still strong

They just want another chance

they want someone to give them a chance again

not to just build it back but build it better than before

And this is the difference between return on investment

and return on kindness

This is the difference between profit

and true wealth

And if it can happen

in a small town in upstate New York and Idaho

it can happen in every city and town and village across the world

This is not the time to build walls

this is a time to start painting the walls

I leave the colors all up to you

Thank you so much

Applause

In   teams from around the world

competed to build robots for disaster response

that could perform a number of tasks

such as using a power tool

working on uneven terrain

and driving a car

That all sounds impressive and it is

but look at the body of the winning robot HUBO
Hubo
Here HUBO is trying to get out of a car

and keep in mind

the video is sped up three times

Laughter

HUBO from team KAIST out of Korea is a stateoftheart robot
KAISTHubo
with impressive capabilities

but this body doesn't look all that different

from robots we've seen a few decades ago

If you look at the other robots in the competition

their movements also still look well very robotic

Their bodies are complex mechanical structures

using rigid materials

such as metal and traditional rigid electric motors

They certainly weren't designed

to be lowcost safe near people

and adaptable to unpredictable challenges

We've made good progress with the brains of robots

but their bodies are still primitive

This is my daughter Nadia

She's only five years old

and she can get out of the car way faster than HUBO

Laughter

She can also swing around on monkey bars with ease

much better than any current humanlike robot could do

In contrast to HUBO
Hubo
the human body makes extensive use of soft and deformable materials

such as muscle and skin

We need a new generation of robot bodies

that is inspired by the elegance efficiency and by the soft materials

of the designs found in nature

And indeed this has become the key idea of a new field of research

called soft robotics

My research group and collaborators around the world

are using soft components inspired by muscle and skin

to build robots with agility and dexterity

that comes closer and closer

to the astonishing capabilities of the organisms found in nature

I've always been particularly inspired by biological muscle

Now that's not surprising

I'm also Austrian and I know that I sound a bit like Arnie the Terminator

Laughter

Biological muscle is a true masterpiece of evolution

It can heal after damage

and it's tightly integrated with sensory neurons

for feedback on motion and the environment

It can contract fast enough to power the highspeed wings

of a hummingbird

it can grow strong enough to move an elephant

and it's adaptable enough to be used in the extremely versatile arms

of an octopus

an animal that can squeeze its entire body through tiny holes

Actuators are for robots what muscles are for animals

key components of the body

that enable movement and interaction with the world

So if we could build soft actuators

or artificial muscles

that are as versatile adaptable

and could have the same performance as the real thing

we could build almost any type of robot

for almost any type of use

Not surprisingly people have tried for many decades

to replicate the astonishing capabilities of muscle

but it's been really hard

About  years ago

when I did my PhD back in Austria

my colleagues and I rediscovered

what is likely one of the very first publications on artificial muscle

published in 

On the shape and volume changes of dielectric bodies

caused by electricity

published by German physicist Wilhelm Rntgen
Wilhelm R  ntgen
Most of you know him as the discoverer of the Xray
X
Following his instructions we used a pair of needles

We connected it to a highvoltage source

and we placed it near a transparent piece of rubber

that was prestretched onto a plastic frame

When we switched on the voltage

the rubber deformed

and just like our biceps flexes our arm

the rubber flexed the plastic frame

It looks like magic

The needles don't even touch the rubber

Now having two such needles is not a practical way

of operating artificial muscles

but this amazing experiment got me hooked on the topic

I wanted to create new ways to build artificial muscles

that would work well for realworld applications

For the next years I worked on a number of different technologies

that all showed promise

but they all had remaining challenges that are hard to overcome

In 

when I started my own lab at CU Boulder
CUBoulder
I wanted to try an entirely new idea

I wanted to combine the high speed and efficiency

of electrically driven actuators

with the versatility of soft fluidic actuators

Therefore I thought

maybe I can try using really old science in a new way

The diagram you see here

shows an effect called Maxwell stress

When you take two metal plates

and place them in a container filled with oil

and then switch on a voltage

the Maxwell stress forces the oil up in between the two plates

and that's what you see here

So the key idea was

can we use this effect to push around oil

contained in soft stretchy structures

And indeed this worked surprisingly well

quite honestly much better than I expected

Together with my outstanding team of students

we used this idea as a starting point

to develop a new technology called HASEL artificial muscles
HASEL
HASELs are gentle enough to pick up a raspberry

without damaging it

They can expand and contract like real muscle

And they can be operated faster than the real thing

They can also be scaled up to deliver large forces

Here you see them lifting a gallon filled with water

They can be used to drive a robotic arm

and they can even selfsense their position

HASELs can be used for very precise movement
HASEL
but they can also deliver very fluidic musclelike movement

and bursts of power to shoot up a ball into the air

When submerged in oil

HASEL artificial muscles can be made invisible
HASEL
So how do HASEL artificial muscles work
HASEL
You might be surprised

They're based on very inexpensive easily available materials

You can even try and I recommend it

the main principle at home

Take a few Ziploc bags and fill them with olive oil
Ziploc
Try to push out air bubbles as much as you can

Now take a glass plate and place it on one side of the bag

When you press down you see the bag contract

Now the amount of contraction is easy to control

When you take a small weight you get a small contraction

With a medium weight we get a medium contraction

And with a large weight you get a large contraction

Now for HASELs the only change is to replace the force of your hand
HASELs
or the weight with an electrical force

HASEL stands for hydraulically amplified selfhealing electrostatic actuators
HASEL
Here you see a geometry called PeanoHASEL actuators
PeanoHASEL
one of many possible designs

Again you take a flexible polymer such as our Ziploc bag
Ziploc
you fill it with an insulating liquid such as olive oil

and now instead of the glass plate

you place an electrical conductor on one side of the pouch

To create something that looks more like a muscle fiber

you can connect a few pouches together

and attached a weight on one side

Next we apply voltage

Now the electric field starts acting on the liquid

It displaces the liquid

and it forces the muscle to contract

Here you see a completed PeanoHASEL actuator
PeanoHASEL
and how it expands and contracts when voltage is applied

Viewed from the side

you can really see those pouches take a more cylindrical shape

such as we saw with the Ziploc bags
Ziploc
We can also place a few such muscle fibers next to each other

to create something that looks even more like a muscle

that also contracts and expands in cross section

These HASELs here are lifting a weight that's about  times heavier
HASELs
than their own weight

Here you see one of our newest designs called quadrant donut HASELs
HSELs
and how they expand and contract

They can be operated incredibly fast reaching superhuman speeds

They are even powerful enough to jump off the ground

Laughter

Overall HASELs show promise to become the first technology
HASEL
that matches or exceeds the performance of biological muscle

while being compatible with largescale manufacturing

This is also a very young technology We are just getting started

We have many ideas how to drastically improve performance

using new materials and new designs to reach a level of performance

beyond biological muscle and also beyond traditional rigid electric motors

Moving towards more complex designs of HASEL for bioinspired robotics
HASEL
here you see our artificial scorpion

that can use its tail to hunt prey

in this case a rubber balloon

Laughter

Going back to our initial inspiration

the versatility of octopus arms and elephant trunks

we are now able to build soft continuum actuators

that come closer and closer to the capabilities of the real thing

I am most excited about the practical applications

of HASEL artificial muscles

They'll enable soft robotic devices

that can improve the quality of life

Soft robotics will enable a new generation of more lifelike prosthetics

for people who have lost parts of their bodies

Here you see some HASELs in my lab

early testing driving a prosthetic finger

One day we may even merge our bodies with robotic parts

I know that sounds very scary at first

But when I think about my grandparents

and the way they become more dependent on others

to perform simple everyday tasks such as using the restroom alone

they often feel like they're becoming a burden

With soft robotics we will be able to enhance and restore

agility and dexterity

and thereby help older people maintain autonomy

for longer parts of their lives

Maybe we can call that robotics for antiaging

or even a next stage of human evolution

Unlike their traditional rigid counterparts

soft lifelike robots will safely operate near people and help us at home

Soft robotics is a very young field We're just getting started

I hope that many young people from many different backgrounds

join us on this exciting journey

and help shape the future of robotics

by introducing new concepts inspired by nature

If we do this right

we can improve the quality of life

for all of us

Thank you

Applause

I'm an exhausted dad

Currently owned and dominated by two mini dictators

who rule my life with an iron fist while wearing their Huggies diapers

Laughter

Now probably because I've been drowning in small people lately

I've been paying close attention to a particular headline

It seems around the world in developed countries

people are having fewer babies

From North America to Europe to China to Japan

there's actually been a consistent decline in birth rates

In fact over the past  years

the global fertility rate has halved

What the heck is going on

Now my friends who don't want kids

all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies

And many of you are sitting there right now saying

Waj there's also overpopulation

there's also high birth rates

which still exist in many African and Middle Eastern countries

there's also orphan kids who still need parents

there's also a lack of resources to go around for everyone

and oh by the way

we have a ginormous carbon footprint that is destroying this planet

I hear you I hear you

And yet despite all this chaos

I still think we should have babies

I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity

side by side

Now if I could take it personal for a second

I get it I get why some of you might be skeptical about having babies

Here's a photo of my wife and me before we had kids

Young happy fresh

Laughter

Here's a photo of me after having kids

A broken defeated husk of a man

Laughter

Here's the photo of the car I thought I'd be driving as an adult

A Porsche

Here's what I actually drive

A Honda Odyssey minivan

Laughter

Applause

For the minivan

Where there was once hope now there is convenient space

and good mileage good mileage

Now I just want to stress

that I'm completely aware of the very dire threats

of global warming and climate change

I just want to acknowledge that choosing to have babies

is a deeply profoundly personal choice

And that many who want to are unable

But just for today let's examine the flip side of the coin

At how not having enough new people

is going to be a major problem moving forward

According to the World Health Organization
World Health Organization
we need to average about  children per woman today

just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation

A lot of you thought overpopulation was going to be a problem in  years 

yeah it might be underpopulation

So a question

what happens if that number dips below 

There's going to be a domino effect

As all of us get older and live longer

there's going to be a shrinking younger population

which is going to lead to rising labor shortages

in the world's biggest economies

I'm talking about United States China Japan Germany

Fewer younger working people means less tax revenue

Less tax revenue means less money and resources

to go to safety net programs that all of us are going to depend upon

I'm talking about pensions and health care

It seems every generation is indeed connected

But how the heck did we get here in the first place

Well in some cases it was intentional

Let's take the DeLorean to simpler times

Let's stop in China

Somewhere between the death of disco and Empire Strikes Back  

In  China decided to implement the onechild policy

largely limiting most parents to having just one kid

to combat overpopulation

Check out some good oldfashioned Chinese propaganda lovely

Now fastforward to 

Even after ending its onechild policy in 

China's birth rates have largely declined

In fact the falling population in China

is removing one of its biggest drivers of growth  people

If trends continue

China's population is actually going to peak in 

before entering unstoppable decline

China's government is so freaked out right now

that it's actually doing new propaganda 

it's begging couples to have children for the country

Let's take the DeLorean and hop over to Japan

home of my beloved Honda Odyssey minivan

Laughter

Japan is now producing more adult diapers than infant ones

The number of kids in Japan has fallen for the th straight year

And unlike other countries

it has not been able to replace its population numbers

through immigrant workers

There will be labor shortages

and not enough money to fund the safetynet programs

Now Japan has introduced two solutions

First a financial incentive
First a financial incentive
Some local governments in Japan have offered couples money to have babies

with the money increasing with each additional child being born

This actually worked for one year in  in this town called Ama

It actually raised the birth rate from about  kids per woman to 

But it did not gain traction across Japan

In  a leader of Japan's ruling party tried a new tack

He told young people

You're selfish for not having babies

Shockingly shaming was not a rousing aphrodisiac

Surprise I know surprise

Who would have thought

Laughter

Let's take the DeLorean to Europe

the continent of delicious cheeses I love to eat but cannot pronounce

The UK and much of Western Europe

has a birth rate of about  kids per woman

which at least is better than Hungary where it hovers around 

Now Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbn

has proposed a new solution to try to incentivize people to have kids

He said families where the women have four or more kids

will no longer pay income tax

Pretty good right pretty good

At least it's better than Russia's  proposal

which once offered women in a particular region

the opportunity of winning a fridge if they had more kids

Laughter

Yeah it didn't work it didn't work

But hold on pump the brakes

Orbn is primarily proposing this because he wants to limit

the population of Muslims and people of color

He says he doesn't think Hungary's traditions and culture and color

has to be mixed with those of others

Subtle

Unfortunately for Orbn and much of the EU

the birth rates are not high enough right now

to be replenished without immigration

Among EU countries there is a demographic decline

So it seems in Europe karma is going to be brown and Muslim

Laughter Applause

Just saying

The question remains

Why aren't people having enough kids

Why is the birth rate declining in these countries

In some cases

it's because women are more literate more educated

They have more economic opportunities  applaud

All good things all good things yes

Applause

In India this has been fantastic

it has actually reduced the birth rate but kept it above that magic  number

Women also have more access to birth control

more control over their reproductive lives

all good things

But in the United States in particular

a lot of young people are opting out of having kids

largely cite the same reason

financial concerns

Let's take the DeLorean to my motherland the United States of America

where the birth rate hit its historic low in 

The United States is the most expensive country in the world

to give birth

If you do not have insurance

it will cost you  dollars to have a baby

if everything goes perfectly

That's like buying a brand new Honda Odyssey minivan OK

So congratulations you just had a baby

but the baby's economic productivity is zero and guess what

The United States is the only industrialized country in the world

that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave

Mom you just had a baby congratulations that's lovely

Get back to work or you're fired young mom

My wife and I both working parents

pay about  dollars a month  a month  in Virginia for childcare

If you do the math that's  dollars a year

That's like buying a brand new soupedup Honda Odyssey minivan OK

I have one I do not need 

So here's my bold suggestion

Let's make it easier for people to have babies

It seems in order to invest in our future we actually have to invest in the present

and help those people who want to become parents

Give them affordable health care

give them affordable childcare

give them paid parental leave

Among the EU states in  France reported the highest birth rates

Why

Largely due to its pronatal policies

that actually kept women in the workforce

I'm talking about subsidized daycare and paid maternal leave

China and Japan thank God are finally wisening up

and proposing such policies

This is great

That being said I know some of you have listened to me

and you still think the best investment we can make in the future

is not having babies

I respect that

I get where you're coming from

And I know many of you in this audience want to have babies

but you are terrified about the future

And as a parent I feel you

I'm scared about the future

I wrote that last line a month ago

But it really hit home three days ago for me

while I was at TED
TED
Three days ago my wife calls me crying

I pick it up in my hotel room

And she said I'm calling from the hospital

We had to take my baby daughter Nusayba

who was named after a warrior princess

to the hospital because she found a bump on the stomach

We got back the results and there were bumps all around her liver

Today this morning we found out that she has stage IV liver cancer
IV
Audience gasps

It has been a challenging week

It has been a challenging week

And if I may I just want to take a moment

to acknowledge the TED staff everyone topdown
TED
everyone in the back in the green room some of the speakers word has spread

On behalf of my family my wife

and my parents  my Pakistani parents said I had to say this 

thank you for just being decent and kind this week

So thank you

Applause

These are my beloveds my Ibrahim and Nusayba my babies

I talked to my wife

and despite the terrible news and the fight ahead

we both concluded that we regret nothing

Deciding to have babies was the best decision we ever made

Our babies have brought us so much joy and they've brought the world so much joy

and having kids is a risk but life is a risk

And yes I hope you've been paying attention

we need to invest in babies in developed countries

if we want to help save our economy and pensions

But that's not the reason you have babies

That's not the main reason

Babies have always represented

humanity's best boldest most beautiful infinite possibilities

And if we in developed countries

as a whole opt out

and don't invest in present and future generations

then what the hell's the point

What's the point of being on this absurd journey together

And so for those who can and who choose to

for those who can and who choose to have kids

may you pass on this beautiful thing called life

with kindness generosity

decency and love

Thank you

Applause

for us to deal with these complicated crises that are interrelated

is that we are at the lowest levels of trust we've ever been at

In the UK three percent of people trust their government

to solve the Brexit crisis

and that was in December

I think it's probably gone down since then

BF What do you think new leadership actually looks like
BF
HT We need courageous leaders
HT
yet they have to be humble

And they have to be guided by a moral compass

and the moral compass is the combination of having a social purpose 

you can't have your license to operate anymore

without a purpose that contributes to society

but what to me has been missing from that dialogue is a set of principles

We cannot just define why we exist

we have to define how we're going to do business

and how we're going to lead

And to us that has to be to solve these imminent crises

the climate crisis

the crisis of inequality

and the crisis of trust

So at The B Team
B
we embrace sustainability equality and accountability as our principles

BF Do you think this whole question of purpose is really window dressing 
BF
they're saying what they think people want to hear

but they're actually not making the fundamental changes

that are necessary

HT A lot of people feel that way

and I think there's a growing momentum behind that

So I think the world is calling for responsible leadership now

and any leader who wants to be around for the st century

really needs to start thinking courageously and holistically

how they're going to be part of the solution

and not windowdress anymore

You have to do it for real now

BF Do you see anybody out there who's doing it
BF
in a way that you think is actually effective

and has a real longterm impact

HT Fortunately we have some great leaders out there
HT
And just to give one example

Emmanuel Faber who's one of the newest members of The B Team
Emmanuel FaberB
he's the CEO of Danone

the world's largest yogurtmaker and major food company 

a real global company

He's so committed to sustainability

that he's not only changing the ways of his own business

but his entire supply chain

He's so committed to equality that when he took on as CEO

and he said gender balance matters

he created a genderbalanced executive team

and gave men and women equal maternity and paternity leave

He's so committed to accountability

that he turned his US operations into a B Corporation
B
Now many of you may not know what that is

but that's a company that holds itself responsible

for not just profit but its impact on people and the planet

and transparently reports on their performance on all of that

It's the largest B Corp in the world
B
So to me that's holistic courageous leadership

and it's really the vision we all need to hold

BF Is this Back to the Future
BF
I mean I wonder when I think about companies 

AnheuserBusch comes to mind in America 

a yearold company that invested in its community

that gave a living wage

before it ended up you know losing and getting sold

Are we really looking now for companies that are global and community citizens

or is that something that is not even useful anymore

HT Well you can do this for the reason that it's risky actually
HT
to continue without doing the right thing now

You can't attract the right talent

you can't attract customers

and increasingly you won't be able to attract capital

You might do it for risk reasons

you might do it for business opportunity reasons

because this is where the growth is

which is why many leaders are doing the right thing

But at the end of the day

we need to ask ourselves

Who are we holding ourselves accountable for

And if that isn't the next generation

I don't know who

So I want to just make very clear

because we tend to think about leadership

as only those who sit in positions of power

To me leadership is not at all like that

There's a leader inside every single one of us

and our most important work in life is to release that leader

And I think one of the greatest global examples we have

of someone who didn't 

no one gave her power 

is the yearold girl called Greta Thunberg
Greta Thunberg
She's from Sweden

and a few years ago she really became 

she has Asperger's

and she became passionate about our climate crisis 

learned everything about it

And faced with the evidence

she just felt so disappointed in her leadership

that she started striking in front of the Swedish parliament

And now she has started a global movement

and hundreds and thousands of school kids are out in the streets

asking us to hold ourselves accountable for their future

No one gave her that authority

and she now speaks to the leaders of the world heads of state

and really is impacting the world

So I really think that when we think about leadership today

it can't be defined to those in positions of power

though they have disproportionately greater responsibility

But all of us need to think about

What am I doing

How am I contributing

And we need to release that leader inside

and actually start making the positive impact

this world is calling for right now

BF But we have such hierarchical leadership
BF
I mean I understand what you're saying 

it's nice to release the leader inside 

but in these corporations

the truth is it's extremely hierarchical

What can companies do

to create less vertical and more horizontal relationships

HT Well I'm a big believer and I've long been passionate
HT
about closing the gender gap

and I really believe genderbalanced leadership is the way to go

in order to embrace a leadership style that has been shown to be more powerful

and that's when both men and women embrace

both masculine and feminine values

It actually is proven in research

that that's the most effective leadership style

But I'm increasingly now thinking about how we close the generational gap

because look at these young children in the streets around the world 

they're asking us to lead

Kofi Annan used to say You're never too young to lead
Kofi Annan
And then he would add

Or too old to learn

And I think we have now entered this era

where we need the wisdom of those with experience

but we need the digital natives of the young generation

to comentor or to mentor us just as much as we can help

with wisdom from the older people

So it's a new reality

and these old sort of hierarchical ways to think about things

they're increasingly coming under pressure in this reality

BF And you've actually called that the hubris syndrome
BF
Can you talk about that

HT Well yes I think hubris is our cancer in leadership

That's when leaders think they know it all

can do it all have all the answers

and don't think they need to surround themselves

with people who will make them better

which to me would in some cases be more women and younger people

and people who are diverse and have different opinions in general

Hubris syndrome is so present in leadership still

and we know many examples of them

I don't need to name them And the problem with that 

Laughter

Yeah we know them  all over the world

not just in this country

But that kind of leadership doesn't unleash leaders in others

No one person

or no one sector even has the solutions we now need to come up with 

the creativity and collaboration we need

The bold and the brave leadership we need to come up with solutions

that cross government private sector civil society young people older people

people of all different backgrounds coming together is the way

to solve the issues that are in front of us

BF Do you see that kind of leadership coming from the bottomup
BF
or the topdown

or do you think a crisis is going to force us

into a reexamination of all of this

HT Well as someone who lived through the most infamous financial meltdown
HT
in my home country Iceland

I hope we don't need another one to learn or to wake up

But I do see that we can't choose one or the other

We do have to transform the way we lead 

from the top the boardroom the CEOs 

we really do have to transform that

but increasingly we will transform that

because we have these social movements coming from the bottom

and throughout society

And the solutions exist

The only thing that's missing is will

So if we just all find a way to embrace a moral compass of our own

to figure out why we exist and how we're going to lead

and if we embrace courage and humility in equal amounts

each one of us can be part of this year period

where we can dramatically transform the world we live in

and make it just

and make it about humanity and not just the financial markets

BF Well we have a lot of people here who I bet have questions for you
BF
and we have a few minutes for questions

so is there anybody that would like to ask Halla a question

Audience Hello my name is Cheryl

I'm an aspiring leader

and I have a question about how you lead when you have no influence

If I'm just an analyst

and I want to speak to senior management

about a change that I feel will affect the whole company

how do I go about changing their minds

when they feel as if they've had relationships that are set

that their way of business is set

How do you change minds when you have no influence

HT Well thank you very much for that fantastic question
HT
So sometimes people at the top won't listen

but it's interesting that with the low trust we have in society right now

the greatest trust we have

is actually between the employee and the employer

according to recent research

So I think that relationship may be the most powerful way

to actually transform the way we do things

So I would start by trying to build a coalition for your good idea

And I don't know a single leader today who will not listen to a concern

that many of their employees hold

I'll give you an example from another B Team leader
B
Marc Benioff the CEO of Salesforce
Marc BenioffSalesforce
He's really been outspoken on homelessness in San Francisco

on LGBTQI rights
LGBTQI
and all of the things that he's been standing up for

he does because his employees care about them

So don't ever think you don't have power if you don't sit in a position of power

Find the way to go convince him 

or her

And Marc for example was convinced to close the gender pay gap by two women
Marc
who worked inside of his organization

who told him We have a gender pay gap

He didn't believe it he said Bring me the data
 
They did and he was smart enough to know he needed to do something about it

and was one the first tech leaders to step up and do so voluntarily

So don't ever think that you don't have power

even if you don't sit in a position of power

but find other people to support you

and make the case

BF Thank you
BF
Anybody else Any other questions
 
Audience Hi I'm overwhelmed by fascination

with everything you're saying so thank you

I just wanted to ask how like diversity in opinion and thought

and also background

has impacted your leadership ability

And what do you think is the barricade that is limiting the overflow of diversity

in all business settings

and what do you think can impact the change in that setting

but also to disrupt the overflow of generations of people staying in place

And what do you think is the next step to breaking several glass ceilings

BF We're going to do an entire Salon just on that question
BF
Laughter

HT I think Bryn said it well but let me try and touch on it
HT
So the way I see gender it is a spectrum 

you know men also have gender

We sometimes forget about that

Laughter

We sometimes forget about that

And I actually played a very masculine woman early in my career

because those were the rules of the game

And I achieved some success with it

but fortunately I got to a place

where I started embracing my feminine side as well

But I would still say that the best leaders embrace both

both women and men

But I see gender also

as one of the most powerful levers to shift values in culture

So the reason I'm so passionate about women in leadership

and believe that balance is needed

is because right now our definition of success is incredibly masculine

It's about financial profit alone or economic growth alone

and we all know that we need more than money

I mean we need wellness

wellbeing of people

and there is no future beyond the wellbeing of our planet

So I think gender may very well be one of the most powerful levers

to help all of us shift our economic and social systems

to be more welcoming

And the answer to your last part 

it's so complicated but let me try to give you a short one

I believe that the way talent and consumption is shifting

is going to increasingly get companies

to look at adding difference into their leadership

because sameness is not working 

BF And difference is a superpower
BF
HT Difference is a superpower
HT
BF Thank you very much
BF
Halla thank you so much I wish we could talk to you all day

Applause and cheers

HT Thank you

So when you think about a child a close friend or a romantic partner

the word love probably comes to mind

and instantly other emotions rush in

joy and hope

excitement trust and security

and yes sometimes sadness and disappointment

There might not be a word in the dictionary

that more of us are connected to than love

Yet given its central importance in our lives

isn't it interesting that we're never explicitly taught how to love

We build friendships

navigate early romantic relationships

get married and bring babies home from the hospital

with the expectation that we'll figure it out

But the truth is we often harm and disrespect the ones we love

It can be subtle things

like guilting a friend into spending time with you

or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts

or shaming a child for their lack of effort at school

 percent of us will be on the receiving end

of unhealthy relationship behaviors

and  percent of us will do unhealthy things

It's part of being human

In its worst form the harm we inflict on loved ones

shows up as abuse and violence

and relationship abuse

is something that one in three women and one in four men

will experience in their lifetime

Now if you're like most people when you hear those stats

you'll go Oh no no no that would never happen to me

It's instinctual to move away from the words abuse and violence

to think that they happen to someone else somewhere else

But the truth is unhealthy relationships and abuse are all around us

We just call them different things and ignore the connection

Abuse sneaks up on us disguised in unhealthy love

I work for an organization called One Love
One Love
started by a family whose daughter Yeardley was killed by her exboyfriend

This was a tragedy no one saw coming

but when they looked back they realized the warning signs were there

just no one understood what they were seeing

Called crazy or drama or too much drinking

his actions weren't understood to be what they really were

which was clear signs of danger

Her family realized that if anyone had been educated about these signs

her death could have been prevented

So today we're on a mission to make sure

that others have the information that Yeardley and her friends didn't
Yeardley
We have three main goals

give all of us a language for talking about a subject

that's quite awkward and uncomfortable to discuss

empower a whole front line namely friends to help

and in the process improve all of our ability to love better

To do this it's always important to start by illuminating

the unhealthy signs that we frequently miss

and our work really focuses on creating content

to start conversations with young people

As you'd expect most of our content is pretty serious

given the subject at hand

but today I'm going to use one of our more lighthearted

yet still thoughtprovoking pieces

The Couplets

to illuminate five markers of unhealthy love

The first is intensity

Video Blue I haven't seen you in a couple days I've missed you

Orange I've missed you too thatslove
 
Blue I haven't seen you in five minutes It feels like a lifetime

What have you been doing without me for five whole minutes

Orange It's been three minutes thatsnotlove
 
Katie Hood Anybody recognize that I don't know I do
 
Abusive relationships don't start out abusive

They start out exciting and exhilarating

There's an intensity of affection and emotion a rush

It feels really good

You feel so lucky like you've hit the jackpot

But in unhealthy love these feelings shift over time

from exciting to overwhelming and maybe a little bit suffocating

You feel it in your gut

Maybe it's when your new boyfriend or girlfriend

says I love you faster than you were ready for

or starts showing up everywhere texting and calling a lot

Maybe they're impatient when you're slow to respond

even though they know you had other things going on that day

It's important to remember that it's not how a relationship starts that matters

it's how it evolves

It's important in the early days of a new relationship

to pay attention to how you're feeling

Are you comfortable with the pace of intimacy

Do you feel like you have space and room to breathe

It's also really important to start practicing using your voice

to talk about your own needs

Are your requests respected

A second marker is isolation

Video Orange  Want to hang out

Orange  Me and my boyfriend always have Monday Funday

Orange  Want to hang out

Orange  Me and my boyfriend always have Monday Funday

Orange  Tomorrow Orange  It's our Tuesday Snooze Day
 
Orange  Wednesday Orange  No Friends Day
 
KH If you ask me isolation is one of the most frequently missed
KH
and misunderstood signs of unhealthy love

Why

Because every new relationship starts out with this intense desire

to spend time together

it's easy to miss when something shifts

Isolation creeps in when your new boyfriend or girlfriend

starts pulling you away from your friends and family

your support system

and tethering you more tightly to them

They might say things like

Why do you hang out with them They're such losers
 
about your best friends

or They want us to break up They're totally against us

about your family

Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt

about everyone from your prerelationship life

Healthy love includes independence

two people who love spending time together

but who stay connected to the people and activities they cared about before

While at first you might spend every waking minute together

over time maintaining independence is key

You do this by making plans with friends and sticking to them

and encouraging your partner to do the same

A third marker of unhealthy love is extreme jealousy

Video Blue  What are you so happy about

Blue  She just started following me on Instagram
Instagram
Blue  What are you so nervous about

Blue  She she just started following me like everywhere

thatsnotlove

KH As the honeymoon period begins to fade
KH
extreme jealousy can creep in

Your partner might become more demanding

needing to know where you are and who you're with all the time

or they might start following you everywhere online and off

Extreme jealousy also brings with it possessiveness and mistrust

frequent accusations of flirting with other people or cheating

and refusal to listen to you when you tell them

they have nothing to worry about and that you only love them

Jealousy is a part of any human relationship

but extreme jealousy is different

There's a threatening desperate and angry edge to it

Love shouldn't feel like this

A fourth marker is belittling

Video Blue Wanna hang out Orange I gotta study
Video Blue Wanna hang out Orange I gotta study
Blue You'll get an A anyway A for amazing thatslove
AA 
Blue Wanna hang out Orange I gotta study
 
Blue You'll get an F anyway
F
F for F for stupid thatsnotlove
F 
KH Yeah hmm

In unhealthy love words are used as weapons

Conversations that used to be fun and lighthearted

turn mean and embarrassing

Maybe your partner makes fun of you in a way that hurts

or maybe they tell stories and jokes for laughs at your expense

When you try to explain that your feelings have been hurt

they shut you down and accuse you of overreacting

Why are you so sensitive What's your problem Give me a break
  
You are silenced by these words

It seems pretty obvious but your partner should have your back

Their words should build you up not break you down

They should keep your secrets and be loyal

They should make you feel more confident

not less

Finally a fifth marker volatility

Video Orange  I'd be sad if we broke up

Orange  I'd be sad too thatslove
 
Orange  I'd so depressed if we ever broke up

I'd throw myself off this step

I would Don't try to stop me
 
thatsnotlove

KH Frequent breakups and makeups high highs and low lows
KH
as tension rises so does volatility

Tearful frustrated fights followed by emotional makeups

hateful and hurtful comments like

You're worthless I'm not even sure why I'm with you

followed quickly by apologies and promises it will never happen again

By this point you've been so conditioned to this relationship roller coaster

that you may not realize how unhealthy and maybe even dangerous

your relationship has become

It can be really hard to see

when unhealthy love turns towards abuse

but it's fair to say that the more of these markers

your relationship might have

the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous your relationship could be

And if your instinct is to break up and leave

which is advice so many of us give our friends

when they're in unhealthy relationships

that's not always the best advice

Time of breakup can be a real trigger for violence

If you fear you might be headed towards abuse or in abuse

you need to consult with experts to get the advice on how to leave safely

But it's not just about romantic relationships

and it's not just about violence

Understanding the signs of unhealthy love

can help you audit and understand nearly every relationship in your life

For the first time you might understand why you're disappointed in a friendship

or why every interaction with a certain family member

leaves you discouraged and anxious

You might even begin to see how your own intensity and jealousy

is causing problems with colleagues at work

Understanding is the first step to improving

and while you can't make every unhealthy relationship healthy 

some you're going to have to leave behind 

you can do your part every day to do relationships better

And here's the exciting news

it's actually not rocket science

Open communication mutual respect

kindness patience 

we can practice these things every day

And while practice will definitely make you better

I have to promise you it's also not going to make you perfect

I do this for a living

and every day I think and talk about healthy relationships

and still I do unhealthy things

Just the other day as I was trying to shuttle my four kids out the door

amidst quarreling squabbling and complaints about breakfast

I completely lost it

With an intentionally angry edge

I screamed

Everybody just shut up and do what I say

You are the worst

I am going to take away screen time and dessert

and anything else you could possibly ever enjoy in life

Laughter

Anybody been there

Applause

Volatility belittling

My oldest son turned around and looked at me and said

Mom that's not love

Laughter

For a minute I really wanted to kill him for calling me out

Trust me

But then I gathered myself

and I thought you know what I'm actually proud

I'm proud that he has a language to make me pause

I want all of my kids to understand what the bar should be

for how they're treated

and to have a language and a voice to use when that bar is not met

versus just accepting it

For too long we've treated relationships as a soft topic

when relationship skills are one of the most important

and hard to build things in life

Not only can understanding unhealthy signs

help you avoid the rabbit hole that leads to unhealthy love

but understanding and practicing the art of being healthy

can improve nearly every aspect of your life

I'm completely convinced

that while love is an instinct and an emotion

the ability to love better is a skill we can all build

and improve on over time

Thank you

In  humanity received a warning

 of the world's leading scientists released the results

of a massive threeyear study into global agriculture

and declared that meat production is destroying our planet

and jeopardizing global health

One of the study's authors explained

that humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet 

[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution

As somebody who's spent the last two decades

advocating a shift away from industrial meat production

I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference

The thing is I've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades

Here's  from the journal Nature

 from Bioscience Journal

 from the National Academy of Sciences

The main point of these studies tends to be climate change

But antibiotic resistance represents just as big of a threat

We are feeding massive doses of antibiotics to farm animals

These antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs

that threaten to render antibiotics obsolete

within all of our lifetimes

You want a scare

Google the end of working antibiotics

I'm going to get one thing out of the way

I am not here to tell anybody what to eat

Individual action is great

but antibiotic resistance and climate change 

they require more

Besides convincing the world to eat less meat hasn't worked

For  years environmentalists global health experts and animal activists

have been begging the public to eat less meat

And yet per capita meat consumption

is as high as it's been in recorded history

The average North American last year ate more than  pounds of meat

And I didn't eat any

Laughter

Which means somebody out there ate  pounds of meat

Laughter

On our current trajectory

we're going to need to be producing  to  percent more meat by 

This requires a global solution

What we need to do is we need to produce the meat that people love

but we need to produce it in a whole new way

I've got a couple of ideas

Idea number one let's grow meat from plants

Instead of growing plants feeding them to animals

and all of that inefficiency

let's grow those plants let's biomimic meat with them

let's make plantbased meat

Idea number two for actual animal meat

let's grow it directly from cells

Instead of growing live animals let's grow the cells directly

It takes six weeks to grow a chicken to slaughter weight

Grow the cells directly you can get that same growth

in six days

This is what that looks like at scale

It's your friendly neighborhood meat brewery

Laughter

I want to make two points about this

The first one is we believe we can do it

In recent years some companies have been producing meat from plants

that consumers cannot distinguish from actual animal meat

and there are now dozens of companies growing actual animal meat

directly from cells

This plantbased and cellbased meat

gives consumers everything that they love about meat 

the taste the texture and so on 

but with no need for antibiotics

and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate

And because these two technologies are so much more efficient

at production scale

these products will be cheaper

But one quick point about that 

it's not going to be easy

These plantbased companies have spent small fortunes on their burgers

and cellbased meat has not yet been commercialized at all

So we're going to need all hands on deck

to make these the global meat industry

For starters we need the present meat industry

We don't want to disrupt the meat industry

we want to transform it

We need their economies of scale

their global supply chain their marketing expertise

and their massive consumer base

We also need governments

Governments spend tens of billions of dollars every single year

on research and development

focused on global health and the environment

They should be putting some of that money into optimizing and perfecting

the production of plantbased and cellbased meat

Look tens of thousands of people died from antibioticresistant superbugs

in North America just last year

By  that number is going to be  million per year globally

And climate change represents an existential threat

to huge portions of our global family

including some of the poorest people on the face of the planet

Climate change antibiotic resistance  these are global emergencies

Meat production is exacerbating these emergencies on a global scale

But we are not going to decrease meat consumption

unless we give consumers alternatives

that cost the same or less and that taste the same or better

We have the solution

Let's make meat from plants Let's grow it directly from cells

It's past time that we mobilize the resources that are necessary

to create the next global agricultural revolution

A traumatic brain injury or TBI
TBI
is a disruption in brain function caused by an external blow to the head

And when you hear that definition

you might think about sports and professional athletes

since it's the kind of injury we're used to seeing on the playing field

And this imagery has really come to define TBI in the public consciousness
TBI
I myself do research on TBI in retired and college athletes
TBI
I stood on a TED stage in 
TED
talking about concussions in kids' sports

So I have to say as someone who researches and treats these injuries

that I've been really gratified to see the growing awareness of TBI

and specifically the short and longterm risks to athletes

Today though I want to introduce you to a larger but no less controversial

group of people impacted by traumatic brain injury

who don't often show up in the headlines

I've come to recognize these inmates and probationers

as surprisingly among the most vulnerable members of society

For the last six years my colleagues and I have been doing research

that has completely changed the way we think about the criminal justice system

and the people in it

And it may change the way you think about those things too

So I'll start with a shocking statistic

 to  percent of people in criminal justice

have a traumatic brain injury

Up to  percent

In the general public in this room for example

that number is less than five percent

And I'm not just talking about getting your bell rung

These are the kinds of injuries that require hospitalization

Most of them are the product of a physical assault

and some of them are actually sustained in jail

All of these numbers are even higher among the women in criminal justice

Almost every single woman in the criminal justice system

has been exposed to interpersonal violence and abuse

More than half of these women have been exposed to repeated brain injuries

In this way these women's brains look like the brains of retired NFL players
NFL
and they'll likely face the same risks for dementing diseases as they age

The same risks

TBI together with mental illness and substance abuse and trauma
TBI
makes it hard for people to think

They have cognitive impairments like poor judgment and poor impulse control

problems that make criminal justice a revolving door

People get arrested and booked into jail

They oftentimes get into trouble while they're in there

They get into fights They fall out of their bunk

And then they get released and do stupid things

like forgetting mandatory checkins and they get rearrested

Statistically speaking

they're actually more likely to be rearrested than not

A colleague calls this serving a life sentence  days at a time

And oftentimes these folks don't know why this is so hard for them

They feel out of control and frustrated

So knowing that TBI is at the root of so many of these challenges
TBI
the mission for a group of us in Colorado has been to disrupt that cycle

to jam the revolving the door

So working together with my state and local partners

we crafted a plan to meet everyone's needs

the system the inmates and probationers

my graduate students

In this program we assess how each person's brain works

so that we can recommend basic modifications

to make this system more effective

and safer

And here when I say safer I mean safer not only for the inmates

but safer also for correctional staff

In some ways this is such a simple approach

We're not treating the brain injury

we're treating the underlying problem that gets people into all of this trouble

in the first place

We do quick neuropsychological screening tests

to identify strengths and weaknesses in the way an inmate thinks

Using that information we write two reports

One a report for the system

with specific recommendations on how to manage that inmate

The other is a letter to the inmate

with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves

For example if our test result suggests that a probationer has a hard time

remembering the things they hear

that would be an auditory memory deficit

In that case our letter to the court might suggest

that that probationer get handouts of important information

And our letter to that probationer would say among other things

that they should carry a notebook to record that information for themselves

Now most importantly

is that I pause here to be really clear about one point

This program does not minimize responsibility

or make excuses for anyone's behavior

This is about changing longstanding negative perceptions

and building selfadvocacy

It's actually about taking responsibility

The inmates move from

I'm a total screwup I'm a loser

to Here's what I don't do well

and here's what I have to do about it

And the system comes to see an inmate's problematic behavior

as the things they can't do

versus the things they won't do

And that change 

seeing behavior as a deficit rather than outright defiance 

is everything in these settings

We hear from inmates around the country

and they write and more than anything they want to know how to help themselves

This is an excerpt from a letter from Troy in Virginia

an excerpt from a page letter

And he writes

Can you tell me what you think of all the head traumas I've dealt with

What can I do Can you help me
 
Closer to home we have thousands of stories like this

and smart stories stories that have a great outcome

Here's Vinny

Vinny was hit by a car when he was 

and from that moment forward spent more time in jail than in school

With some basic skillbuilding

after our assessment revealed

that he had some pretty significant memory impairments

Vinny learned to use the alarm and reminder function on his iPhone
iPhone
to track important appointments

and he keeps a checklist to break larger tasks

into smaller manageable ones

And with basic tools like that under his belt

Vinny's been out of jail for two years

clean for nine months

and recently back to work

Applause

What's so striking for Vinny

is that this is his first time off of court supervision

since his injury more than  years ago

He made it out of the revolving door

Applause

He says now I can do anything

I just have to work a lot harder at it Laughs
 
And here's Thomas

Thomas has some pretty significant attention and behavior problems

after an injury landed him in a coma for more than a month

After relearning how to walk

his first stop

Court

He couldn't imagine a future where he wasn't in trouble

He now carries a calendar to avoid being held in contempt

for missed court dates

and he schedules a break into his day every day

to recharge before he gets agitated

And nobody knows the revolving door

better than the person sitting at the front of the courtroom

This is my good friend and colleague Judge Brian Bowen
Brian Bowen
Now Judge Bowen was already on a mission to make the system work for everyone

and when he heard about this program he saw the perfect fit

He actually sits down with all of his prosecutors

to help them see that there's basically two categories of defendants

in the courtroom

the ones we're afraid of  oftentimes rightfully so 

and the ones we're mad at

These are the ones who miss all of their scheduled appointments

and they blow through the bestlaid probation plans

And Judge Bowen believes that with a little more support

we could move people in this latter category

the maddening category

through and ultimately out of the system

He proved that with Navy veteran Mike

Judge Bowen saw the correlation between Mike's history of a massive foot fall

and his longstanding pattern of difficulty showing up on the right day

for court appointments

and complying with mandatory therapy requirements for example

And instead of sentencing him to more and more jail time

Judge Bowen sent him home with maps and checklists and handouts

and recommended instead vocational rehabilitation

and flexible scheduling for those therapies

And this with those supports Mike's back to work

for the first time since his injury while he was in the service

He's repairing relationships with his family

and just last month

he graduated from Judge Bowen's veteran's court

Applause

This program shows us the overwhelming prevalence

of traumatic brain injuries and cognitive deficits

and the accumulation of brokenness in the criminal justice system

And it highlights the extraordinary power of resilience and responsibility

In Mike and Thomas and Vinny

even Judge Bowen's story

you saw the transformation made possible by a change in perception

and some simple accommodations

All told in this program

these inmates and probationers come to see themselves differently

The system sees them differently

and when you meet them in the community I hope you see them differently too

Thanks guys

Plastics you know about them you may not love them

but chances are you use them every single day

By  researchers estimate
By  researchers estimate
that there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish

Despite our best efforts

only nine percent of all plastic we use winds up being recycled

And even worse

plastic is incredibly tough and durable

and researchers estimate

that it can take anywhere from  to  years

to fully break down

It leaches harmful chemical contaminants into our oceans our soil

our food our water and into us

So how did we wind up with so much plastic waste

Well it's simple

Plastic is cheap durable adaptable and it's everywhere

But the good news is

there's something else that's cheap durable adaptable and everywhere

And my research shows it may even be able to help us

with our plastic pollution problem

I'm talking about bacteria

Bacteria are microscopic living beings invisible to the naked eye

that live everywhere

in all sorts of diverse and extreme environments

from the human gut to soil to skin

to vents in the ocean floor reaching temperatures of  degrees Fahrenheit

Bacteria live everywhere

in all sorts of diverse and extreme environments

And as such they have to get pretty creative with their food sources

There's also a lot of them

Researchers estimate that there are roughly five million trillion trillion 

that's a five with  zeros after it  bacteria on the planet

Now considering that we humans produce

 million tons of new plastic each year

I'd say that our plastic numbers

are looking pretty comparable to bacteria's

So after noticing this

and after learning about all of the creative ways

that bacteria find food

I started to think

could bacteria in plasticpolluted environments

have figured out how to use plastic for food

Well this is the question that I decided to pursue a couple of years ago

Now fortunately for me

I'm from one of the most polluted cities in America

Houston Texas

Laughs

In my hometown alone

there are seven EPAdesignated Superfund sites

These are sites that are so polluted

that the government has deemed their cleanup a national priority

So I decided to trek around to these sites

and collect soil samples teeming with bacteria

I started toying with a protocol

which is fancy science talk for a recipe

And what I was trying to cook up was a carbonfree media

or a foodfree environment

An environment without the usual carbons or food

that bacteria like us humans need to live

Now in this environment

I would provide my bacteria with a sole carbon or food source

I would feed my bacteria polyethylene terephthalate

or PET plastic
PET
PET plastic is the most widely produced plastic in the world

It's used in all sorts of food and drink containers

with the most notorious example being plastic water bottles

of which we humans currently go through at a rate of one million per minute

So what I would be doing

is essentially putting my bacteria on a forced diet of PET plastic
PET
and seeing which if any might survive or hopefully thrive

See this type of experiment would act as a screen

for bacteria that had adapted to their plasticpolluted environment

and evolved the incredibly cool ability to eat PET plastic
PET
And using this screen

I was able to find some bacteria that had done just that

These bacteria had figured out how to eat PET plastic
PET
So how do these bacteria do this

Well it's actually pretty simple

Just as we humans digest carbon or food into chunks of sugar

that we then use for energy

so too do my bacteria

My bacteria however have figured out how to do this digestion process

to big tough durable PET plastic
PET
Now to do this my bacteria use a special version

of what's called an enzyme

Now enzymes are simply compounds that exist in all living things

There are many different types of enzymes

but basically they make processes go forward

such as the digestion of food into energy

For instance we humans have an enzyme called an amylase

that helps us digest complex starches such as bread

into small chunks of sugar that we can then use for energy

Now my bacteria have a special enzyme called a lipase

that binds to big tough durable PET plastic
PET
and helps break it into small chunks of sugar

that my bacteria can then use for energy

So basically

PET plastic goes from being a big tough longlasting pollutant

to a tasty meal for my bacteria

Sounds pretty cool right

And I think given the current scope of our plastic pollution problem

I think it sounds pretty useful

The statistics I shared with you

on just how much plastic waste has accumulated on our planet

are daunting

They're scary

And I think they highlight

that while reducing reusing and recycling are important

they alone are not going to be enough to solve this problem

And this is where I think bacteria might be able to help us out

But I do understand why the concept of bacterial help

might make some people a little nervous

After all if plastic is everywhere and these bacteria eat plastic

isn't there a risk of these bacteria getting out in the environment

and wreaking havoc

Well the short answer is no and I'll tell you why

These bacteria are already in the environment

The bacteria in my research are not genetically modified frankenbugs

These are naturally occurring bacteria

that have simply adapted to their plasticpolluted environment

and evolved the incredibly gnarly ability to eat PET plastic
PET
So the process of bacteria eating plastic is actually a natural one

But it's an incredibly slow process

And there remains a lot of work to be done

to figure out how to speed up this process to a useful pace

My research is currently looking at ways of doing this

through a series of UV or ultraviolet pretreatments

which basically means we blast PET plastic with sunlight
PET
We do this because sunlight acts a bit like tenderizer on a steak

turning the big tough durable bonds in PET plastic
PET
a bit softer and a bit easier for my bacteria to chew on

Ultimately what my research hopes to do

is create an industrialscale contained carbonfree system

similar to a compost heap

where these bacteria can thrive in a contained system

where their sole food source is PET plastic waste
PET
Imagine one day being able to dispose of all of your plastic waste

in a bin at the curb

that you knew was bound for a dedicated bacteriapowered plastic waste facility

I think with some hard work this is an achievable reality

Plasticeating bacteria is not a cureall

But given the current statistics it's clear that we humans

we could use a little help with this problem

Because people

we possess a pressing problem of plastic pollution

And bacteria might be a really important part of the solution

Thank you

My name is Hannah

And that is a palindrome

That is a word you can spell the same forwards and backwards

if you can spell

But the thing is 

Laughter

my entire family have palindromic names

It's a bit of a tradition

We've got Mum Dad 

Laughter

Nan Pop

Laughter

And my brother Kayak

Laughter

There you go

That's just a bit a joke there

Laughter

I like to kick things off with a joke because I'm a comedian

Now there's two things you know about me already

my name's Hannah and I'm a comedian

I'm wasting no time

Here's a third thing you can know about me

I don't think I'm qualified to speak my own mind

Bold way to begin a talk yes

but it's true

I've always had a great deal of difficulty

turning my thinking into the talking

So it seems a bit of a contradiction then

that someone like me who is so bad at the chat

could be something like a standup comedian

But there you go There you go

It's what it is

I first tried my hand at standup comedi  comedie  See
Comedie
See See
 
Laughter

I first tried my hand at standup comedy

in my late s

and despite being a pathologically shy virtual mute with low selfesteem

who'd never held a microphone before

I knew as soon as I walked and stood in front of the audience

I knew before I'd even landed my first joke

I knew that I really liked standup

and standup really liked me

But for the life of me I couldn't work out why

Why is it I could be so good at doing something I was so bad at

Laughter

I just couldn't work it out I could not understand it

That is until I could

Now before I explain to you why it is

that I can be good at something I'm so bad at

let me throw another spanner of contradiction into the work

by telling you that not long after I worked out why that was

I decided to quit comedy

And before I explain that little oppositional cat

I just threw amongst the thinking pigeons

let me also tell you this

quitting launched my comedy career

Laughter

Like really launched it to the point where after quitting comedy

I became the most talkedabout comedian on the planet

because apparently I'm even worse at making retirement plans

than I am at speaking my own mind

Now all I've done up until this point

apart from giving over a spattering of biographical detail

is to tell you indirectly that I have three ideas

that I want to share with you today

And I've done that by way of sharing three contradictions

one I am bad at talking I am good at talking

I quit I did not quit

Three ideas three contradictions

Now if you're wondering why there's only two things

on my socalled list of three 

Laughter

I remind you it is literally a list of contradictions

Keep up

Laughter

Now the folks at TED advised me that with a talk of this length
TED
it's best to stick with just sharing one idea

I said no

Laughter

What would they know

To explain why I have chosen to ignore what is clearly very good advice

I want to take you back to the beginning of this talk

specifically my palindrome joke

Now that joke uses my favorite trick of the comedian trade

the rule of three

whereby you make a statement

and then back that statement up

with a list

My entire family have palindromic names

Mum Dad Nan Pop

The first two ideas on that list create a pattern

and that pattern creates expectation

And then the third thing  bam  Kayak What
  
That's the rule of three

One two surprise Ha ha
 
Laughter

Now the rule of three is not only fundamental to the way I do my craft

it is also fundamental to the way I communicate

So I won't be changing anything for nobody

not even TED
TED
which I will point out stands for three ideas

technology entertainment

and dickheads

Laughter

Works every time doesn't it

But you need more than just jokes

to be able to cut it as a professional comedian

You need to be able to walk that fine line between being charming

and disarming

And I discovered the most effective way to generate the amount of charm I needed

to offset my disarming personality

was through not jokes but stories

So my standup routines are filled with stories

stories about growing up my coming out story

stories about the abuse I've copped for being not only a woman

but a big woman and a masculineofcenter woman

If you watch my work online check the comments out below

for examples of abuse

Laughter

It's that time in the talk where I shift into second gear

and I'm going to tell you a story about everything I've just said

In the last few days of her life

my grandma was surrounded by people

a lot of people

because my grandma was the loving matriarch

of a large and loving family

Now if you haven't made the connection already

I am a member of that family

I was lucky enough to be able to say goodbye to my grandma

on the day she died

But as she was already cocooned within herself by then

it was something of a onesided goodbye

So I thought about a lot of things

things I hadn't thought about in a long time

like the letters I used to write to my grandma

when I first started university

letters I filled with funny stories and anecdotes

that I embellished for her amusement

And I remembered how I couldn't articulate

the anxiety and fear that filled me as I tried to carve my tiny little life

into a world that felt far too big for me

But I remembered finding comfort in those letters

because I wrote them with my grandma in mind

But as the world got more and more overwhelming

and my ability to negotiate it got worse not better

I stopped writing those letters

I just didn't think I had the life that Grandma would want to read about

Grandma did not know I was gay

and about six months before she died

out of nowhere she asked me if I had a boyfriend

Now I remember making a conscious decision in that moment

not to come out to my grandmother

And I did that because I knew her life was drawing to an end

and my time with her was finite

and I did not want to talk about the ways we were different

I wanted to talk about the ways were we connected

So I changed the subject

And at the time it felt like the right decision

But as I sat witness to my grandmother's life

as it tapered to its inevitable end

I couldn't help but feel I'd made a mistake

not to share such a significant part of my life

But I also knew that I'd missed my opportunity

and as Grandma always used to say

Ah well it's all part of the soup

Too late to take the onions out now

Laughter

And I thought about that

and I thought about how I had to deal with too many onions

as a kid

growing up gay in a state where homosexuality was illegal

And with that thought I could see how tightly wrapped

in the tendrils of my own internalized shame I was

And with that I thought about all my traumas

the violence the abuse my rape

And with all that cluster of thinking

a thought a question kept popping into my mind

to which I had no answer

What is the purpose of my human

Out of anyone in my family I felt the most akin to my grandmother

I mean we share the most traits in common

Not so much these days

Death really changes people

But that 

Laughter

is my grandmother's sense of humor

But the person I felt most akin to in the world

was a mother a grandmother a greatgrandmother

a greatgreatgrandmother

Me I represented the very end of my branch of the family tree
 
And I wasn't entirely sure I was still connected to the trunk

What was the purpose of my human

The year after my grandmother's death was the most intensely creative

of my life

And I suppose that's because at an end my thoughts gather

more than they scatter

My thought process is not linear

I'm a visual thinker I see my thoughts

I don't have a photographic memory

and nor is my head a static gallery of sensibly collected think pieces

It's more that I've got this everevolving language of hieroglyphics

that I've developed

and can understand fluently and think deeply with

but I struggle to translate

I can't paint draw sculpt or even haberdash

and as for the written word

I'm OK at it but it's a tortuous process of translation

and I don't feel it does the job

And as far as speaking my own mind like I said I'm not great at it

Speech has always felt like an inadequate freezeframe

for the life inside of me

All this to say

I've always understood far more than I've ever been able to communicate

Now about a year before Grandma died

I was formally diagnosed with autism

Now for me that was mostly good news

I always thought that I couldn't sort my life out like a normal person

because I was depressed and anxious

But it turns out

I was depressed and anxious

because I couldn't sort my life out like a normal person

because I was not a normal person

and I didn't know it

Now this is not to say I still don't struggle

Every day is a bit of a struggle

to be honest

But at least now I know what my struggle is

and getting to the starting line of normal is not it

My struggle is not to escape the storm

My struggle is to find the eye of the storm as best I can

Now apart from the usual way us spectrum types find our calm 

repetitive behaviors routine and obsessive thinking 

I have another surprising doorway into the eye of the storm

standup comedy

And if you need any more proof I'm neurodivergent yes

I am calm doing a thing that scares the hell out of most people

I'm almost dead inside up here

Laughter

Diagnosis gave me a framework on which to hang bits of me

I could never understand

My misfit suddenly had a fit

and for a while I got giddy with a newfound confidence

I had in my thinking

But after Grandma died that confidence took a dive

because thinking is how I grieve

And in that grief of thought

I could suddenly see with so much clarity

just how profoundly isolated I was and always had been

What was the purpose of my human

I began to think a lot about how autism and PTSD have so much in common

And I started to worry

because I had both

Could I ever untangle them

I'd always been told that the way out of trauma

was through a cohesive narrative

I had a cohesive narrative

but I was still at the mercy of my traumas

They're all part of my soup but the onions still stung

And at that point I realized

that I'd been telling my stories for laughs

I'd been trimming away the darkness cutting away the pain

and holding on to my trauma for the comfort of my audience

I was connecting other people through laughs

yet I remained profoundly disconnected

What was the purpose of my human

I did not have an answer

but I had an idea

I had an idea to tell my truth

all of it

not to share laughs but to share the literal visceral pain of my trauma

And I thought the best way to do that would be through a comedy show

And that is what I did

I wrote a comedy show that did not respect the punchline

that line where comedians are expected and trusted to pull their punches

and turn them into tickles

I did not stop

I punched through that line

into the metaphorical guts of my audience

I did not want to make them laugh

I wanted to take their breath away

to shock them

so they could listen to my story and hold my pain

as individuals not as a mindless laughing mob

And that's what I did and I called that show Nanette

Now many 

Applause

Now many have argued

that Nanette is not a comedy show

And while I can agree Nanette is definitely not a comedy show

those people are still wrong 

Laughter

because they have framed their argument

as a way of saying I failed to do comedy

I did not fail to do comedy

I took everything I knew about comedy 

all the tricks the tools the knowhow 

I took all that and with it I broke comedy

You cannot break comedy with comedy

if you fail at comedy

Flaccid be thy hammer

Laughter Applause

That was not my point

The point was not simply to break comedy

The point was to break comedy so I could rebuild it and reshape it

reform it into something that could better hold everything

I needed to share

and that is what I meant when I said I quit comedy

Now it's probably at this point where you're going Yeah cool

but what are the three ideas exactly

It's a bit vague

I'm glad I pretended you asked

Laughter

Now I'm sure there's quite a few of you who have already identified three ideas

A smart crowd by all accounts

so I wouldn't be surprised at all

But you might be surprised to find out that I don't have three ideas

I told you I had three ideas and that was a lie

That was pure misdirection  I'm very funny

What I've done instead is I've taken whole handfuls of my ideas as seeds

and I've scattered them all throughout my talk

And why did I do that

Well apart from shits and giggles

it comes down to something my grandma always used to say

It's not the garden it's the gardening that counts

And Nanette taught me the truth to that truism

I fully expected by breaking the contract of comedy

and telling my story in all its truth and pain

that that would push me further into the margins of both life and art

I expected that and I was willing to pay that cost in order to tell my truth

But that is not what happened

The world did not push me away It pulled me closer

Through an act of disconnection I found connection

And it took me a long time to understand

that what is at the heart of that contradiction

is also at the heart of the contradiction

as to why I can be so good at something I am so bad at

You see in the real world

I struggle to talk to people

because my neurodiversity makes it difficult for me to think

listen speak and process new information

all at the same time

But onstage I don't have to think

I prepare my thinks well in advance

I don't have to listen That is your job

Laughter

And I don't really have to talk

because strictly speaking I'm reciting

So all that is left

is for me to do my best

to make a genuine connection with my audience

And if the experience of Nanette taught me anything

it's that connection depends not just on me

You play a part

Nanette may have begun in me

but she now lives and grows in a whole world of other minds

minds I do not share

But I trust I am connected

And in that she is so much bigger than me

just like the purpose of being human is so much bigger than all of us

Make of that what you will

Thank you and hello

Applause

You don't know them

You don't see them

But they're always around

whispering

making secret plans

building armies with millions of soldiers

And when they decide to attack

they all attack at the same time

I'm talking about bacteria

Laughter

Who did you think I was talking about

Bacteria live in communities just like humans

They have families

they talk

and they plan their activities

And just like humans they trick deceive

and some might even cheat on each other

What if I tell you that we can listen to bacterial conversations

and translate their confidential information into human language

And what if I tell you that translating bacterial conversations can save lives

I hold a PhD in nanophysics

and I've used nanotechnology to develop a realtime translation tool

that can spy on bacterial communities

and give us recordings of what bacteria are up to

Bacteria live everywhere

They're in the soil on our furniture

and inside our bodies

In fact  percent of all the live cells in this theater are bacterial

Some bacteria are good for us

they help us digest food or produce antibiotics

And some bacteria are bad for us

they cause diseases and death

To coordinate all the functions bacteria have

they have to be able to organize

and they do that just like us humans 

by communicating

But instead of using words

they use signaling molecules to communicate with each other

When bacteria are few

the signaling molecules just flow away

like the screams of a man alone in the desert

But when there are many bacteria the signaling molecules accumulate

and the bacteria start sensing that they're not alone

They listen to each other

In this way they keep track of how many they are

and when they're many enough to initiate a new action

And when the signaling molecules have reached a certain threshold

all the bacteria sense at once that they need to act

with the same action

So bacterial conversation consists of an initiative and a reaction

a production of a molecule and the response to it

In my research I focused on spying on bacterial communities

inside the human body

How does it work

We have a sample from a patient

It could be a blood or spit sample

We shoot electrons into the sample

the electrons will interact with any communication molecules present

and this interaction will give us information

on the identity of the bacteria

the type of communication

and how much the bacteria are talking

But what is it like when bacteria communicate

Before I developed the translation tool

my first assumption was that bacteria would have a primitive language

like infants that haven't developed words and sentences yet

When they laugh they're happy when they cry they're sad
 
Simple as that

But bacteria turned out to be nowhere as primitive as I thought they would be

A molecule is not just a molecule

It can mean different things depending on the context

just like the crying of babies can mean different things

sometimes the baby is hungry

sometimes it's wet

sometimes it's hurt or afraid

Parents know how to decode those cries

And to be a real translation tool

it had to be able to decode the signaling molecules

and translate them depending on the context

And who knows

Maybe Google Translate will adopt this soon
Google Translate
Laughter

Let me give you an example

I've brought some bacterial data that can be a bit tricky to understand

if you're not trained

but try to take a look

Laughter

Here's a happy bacterial family that has infected a patient

Let's call them the Montague family

They share resources they reproduce and they grow

One day they get a new neighbor

bacterial family Capulet

Laughter

Everything is fine as long as they're working together

But then something unplanned happens

Romeo from Montague has a relationship with Juliet from Capulet

Laughter

And yes they share genetic material

Laughter

Now this gene transfer can be dangerous to the Montagues

that have the ambition to be the only family in the patient they have infected

and sharing genes contributes

to the Capulets developing resistance to antibiotics

So the Montagues start talking internally to get rid of this other family

by releasing this molecule

Laughter

And with subtitles

[Let us coordinate an attack]
[]
Laughter

Let's coordinate an attack

And then everybody at once responds

by releasing a poison that will kill the other family

[Eliminate]
[]
Laughter

The Capulets respond by calling for a counterattack

[Counterattack]
[]
And they have a battle

This is a video of real bacteria dueling with swordlike organelles

where they try to kill each other

by literally stabbing and rupturing each other

Whoever's family wins this battle becomes the dominant bacteria

So what I can do is to detect bacterial conversations

that lead to different collective behaviors

like the fight you just saw

And what I did was to spy on bacterial communities

inside the human body

in patients at a hospital

I followed  patients in an experiment

where I tested the patient samples for one particular infection

without knowing the results of the traditional diagnostic test

Now in bacterial diagnostics

a sample is smeared out on a plate

and if the bacteria grow within five days

the patient is diagnosed as infected

When I finished the study and I compared the tool results

to the traditional diagnostic test and the validation test

I was shocked

It was far more astonishing than I had ever anticipated

But before I tell you what the tool revealed

I would like to tell you about a specific patient I followed

a young girl

She had cystic fibrosis

a genetic disease that made her lungs susceptible to bacterial infections

This girl wasn't a part of the clinical trial

I followed her because I knew from her medical record

that she had never had an infection before

Once a month this girl went to the hospital

to cough up a sputum sample that she spit in a cup

This sample was transferred for bacterial analysis

at the central laboratory

so the doctors could act quickly if they discovered an infection

And it allowed me to test my device on her samples as well

The first two months I measured on her samples there was nothing

But the third month

I discovered some bacterial chatter in her sample

The bacteria were coordinating to damage her lung tissue

But the traditional diagnostics showed no bacteria at all

I measured again the next month

and I could see that the bacterial conversations became even more aggressive

Still the traditional diagnostics showed nothing

My study ended but a half a year later I followed up on her status

to see if the bacteria only I knew about had disappeared

without medical intervention

They hadn't

But the girl was now diagnosed with a severe infection

of deadly bacteria

It was the very same bacteria my tool discovered earlier

And despite aggressive antibiotic treatment

it was impossible to eradicate the infection

Doctors deemed that she would not survive her s

When I measured on this girl's samples

my tool was still in the initial stage

I didn't even know if my method worked at all

therefore I had an agreement with the doctors

not to tell them what my tool revealed

in order not to compromise their treatment

So when I saw these results that weren't even validated

I didn't dare to tell

because treating a patient without an actual infection

also has negative consequences for the patient

But now we know better

and there are many young boys and girls that still can be saved

because unfortunately this scenario happens very often

Patients get infected

the bacteria somehow don't show on the traditional diagnostic test

and suddenly the infection breaks out in the patient with severe symptoms

And at that point it's already too late

The surprising result of the  patients I followed

was that my device caught bacterial conversations

in more than half of the patient samples

that were diagnosed as negative by traditional methods

In other words more than half of these patients went home thinking

they were free from infection

although they actually carried dangerous bacteria

Inside these wrongly diagnosed patients

bacteria were coordinating a synchronized attack

They were whispering to each other

What I call whispering bacteria

are bacteria that traditional methods cannot diagnose

So far it's only the translation tool that can catch those whispers

I believe that the time frame in which bacteria are still whispering

is a window of opportunity for targeted treatment

If the girl had been treated during this window of opportunity

it might have been possible to kill the bacteria

in their initial stage

before the infection got out of hand

What I experienced with this young girl made me decide to do everything I can

to push this technology into the hospital

Together with doctors

I'm already working on implementing this tool in clinics

to diagnose early infections

Although it's still not known how doctors should treat patients

during the whispering phase

this tool can help doctors keep a closer eye on patients in risk

It could help them confirm if a treatment had worked or not

and it could help answer simple questions

Is the patient infected

And what are the bacteria up to

Bacteria talk

they make secret plans

and they send confidential information to each other

But not only can we catch them whispering

we can all learn their secret language

and become ourselves bacterial whisperers

And as bacteria would say

Thank you

So  was a big year for me

Do you ever have that

just like a big year like a banner year

For me it went like this

October  I lost my second pregnancy

And then October  my dad died of cancer

And then on November  my husband Aaron died

after three years with stagefour glioblastoma

which is just a fancy word for brain cancer

So I'm fun

Laughter

People love to invite me out all the time

Packed social life

Usually when I talk about this period of my life

the reaction I get is essentially

Sighs

I can't  I can't imagine

But I do think you can

I think you can

And I think that you should

because someday it's going to happen to you

Maybe not these specific losses in this specific order or at this speed

but like I said I'm very fun

and the research that I have seen will stun you

everyone you love has a  percent chance of dying

Laughter

And that's why you came to TED
TED
Laughter

Applause

So since all of this loss happened

I've made it a career to talk about death and loss

not just my own because it's pretty easy to recap

but the losses and tragedies that other people have experienced

It's a niche I have to say

Laughter

It's a small niche and I wish I made more money but 

Laughter

I've written some very uplifting books

host a very uplifting podcast I started a little nonprofit

I'm just trying to do what I can

to make more people comfortable with the uncomfortable

and grief is so uncomfortable

It's so uncomfortable especially if it's someone else's grief

So part of that work is this group that I started with my friend Moe

who is also a widow

we call it the Hot Young Widows Club

Laughter

And it's real we have membership cards

and Tshirts
T
And when your person dies your husband wife girlfriend boyfriend

literally don't care if you were married

your friends and your family are just going to look around

through friends of friends of friends of friends

until they find someone who's gone through something similar

and then they'll push you towards each other

so you can talk amongst yourselves and not get your sad on other people

Laughter

So that's what we do

It's just a series of small groups

where men women gay straight married partnered

can talk about their dead person

and say the things

that the other people in their lives aren't ready or willing to hear yet

Huge range of conversations

Like My husband died two weeks ago

I can't stop thinking about sex is that normal

Yeah

What if it's one of the Property Brothers
Property Brothers
Less normal but I'll accept it

Laughter

Things like Look when I'm out in public and I see old people holding hands

couples who have clearly been together for decades

and then I look at them and I imagine

all of the things they've been through together

the good things the bad things

the arguments they've had over who should take out the trash 

I just find my heart filled with rage

Laughter

And that example is personal to me

Most of the conversations that we have in the group

can and will just stay amongst ourselves

but there are things that we talk about

that the rest of the world  the world that is griefadjacent

but not yet griefstricken 

could really benefit from hearing

And if you can't tell

I'm only interested in  capable of unscientific studies

so what I did was go to The Hot Young Widows Club

and say Hello friends remember when your person died They did
 
Do you remember all the things people said to you

Oh yeah

Which ones did you hate the most

I got a lot of comments lot of answers people say a lot of things

but two rose to the top pretty quickly

Moving on

Now since 

I will tell you I have remarried a very handsome man named Matthew

we have four children in our blended family

we live in the suburbs of Minneapolis Minnesota USA

We have a rescue dog

Laughter

I drive a minivan

like the kind where doors open and I don't even touch them

Laughter

Like by any mezhure life is good
mezhure
I've also never said mezhure I've never once said it that way
mezhure
Laughter

I don't know where that came from

Laughter

I've never heard anyone else say it that way

It looks like it should be said that way

and that's why the English language is trash so 

Laughter

So impressed with anyone who like speaks it

in addition to a language that makes sense  good job

Laughter

But by any measure 

Laughter

By any measure life is really really good but I haven't moved on

I haven't moved on and I hate that phrase so much

and I understand why other people do

Because what it says

is that Aaron's life and death and love are just moments

that I can leave behind me  and that I probably should

And when I talk about Aaron I slip so easily into the present tense

and I've always thought that made me weird

And then I noticed that everybody does it

And it's not because we are in denial or because we're forgetful

it's because the people we love who we've lost

are still so present for us

So when I say Oh Aaron is 

It's because Aaron still is

And it's not in the way that he was before

which was much better

and it's not in the way that churchy people try to tell me that he would be

It's just that he's indelible

and so he is present for me

Here

he's present for me in the work that I do

in the child that we had together

in these three other children I'm raising

who never met him who share none of his DNA
DNA
but who are only in my life because I had Aaron

and because I lost Aaron

He's present in my marriage to Matthew

because Aaron's life and love and death

made me the person that Matthew wanted to marry

So I've not moved on from Aaron

I've moved forward with him

Applause

We spread Aaron's ashes in his favorite river in Minnesota

and when the bag was empty 

because when you're cremated you fit into a plastic bag 

there were still ashes stuck to my fingers

And I could have just put my hands in the water and rinsed them

but instead I licked my hands clean

because I was so afraid of losing more than I had already lost

and I was so desperate to make sure that he would always be a part of me

But of course he would be

Because when you watch your person fill himself with poison for three years

just so he can stay alive a little bit longer with you

that stays with you

When you watch him fade from the healthy person he was the night you met

to nothing that stays with you

When you watch your son who isn't even two years old yet

walk up to his father's bed on the last day of his life

like he knows what's coming in a few hours

and say I love you All done Bye bye

That stays with you

Just like when you fall in love finally like really fall in love

with someone who gets you and sees you

and you even see Oh my God I've been wrong this entire time

Love is not a contest or a reality show  it's so quiet

it's this invisible thread of calm that connects the two of us

even when everything is chaos

when things are falling apart even when he's gone

That stays with you

We used to do this thing 

because my hands are always freezing and he's so warm

where I would take my icecold hands and shove them up his shirt 

press them against his hot bod

Laughter

And he hated it so much

Laughter

but he loved me

and after he died I laid in bed with Aaron

and I put my hands underneath him

and I felt his warmth

And I can't even tell you if my hands were cold

but I can tell you

that I knew it was the last time I would ever do that

And that that memory is always going to be sad

That memory will always hurt

Even when I'm  years old and I'm just a hologram

Laughter

Just like the memory of meeting him is always going to make me laugh

Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum

it happens alongside of and mixed in with all of these other emotions

So I met Matthew my current husband 

who doesn't love that title

Laughter

but it's so accurate

Laughter

I met Matthew and 

there was this audible sigh of relief among the people who love me

like It's over

She did it

She got a happy ending we can all go home

And we did good

And that narrative is so appealing even to me

and I thought maybe I had gotten that too but I didn't

I got another chapter

And it's such a good chapter  I love you honey 

it's such a good chapter

But especially at the beginning it was like an alternate universe

or one of those old choose your own adventure books from the 's

where there are two parallel plot lines

So I opened my heart to Matthew

and my brain was like Would you like to think about Aaron

Like the past the present future just get in there and I did

And all of a sudden those two plots were unfurling at once

and falling in love with Matthew really helped me realize the enormity

of what I lost when Aaron died

And just as importantly

it helped me realize that my love for Aaron

and my grief for Aaron

and my love for Matthew are not opposing forces

They are just strands to the same thread

They're the same stuff

I'm  what would my parents say

I'm not special

Laughter

They had four kids they were like  frankly

Laughter

But I'm not I'm not special

I know that I'm fully aware

that all day every day all around the world

terrible things are happening

All the time

Like I said fun person

But terrible things are happening

people are experiencing deeply formative and traumatic losses every day

And as part of my job

this weird podcast that I have

I sometimes talk to people

about the worst thing that's ever happened to them

And sometimes that's the loss of someone they love

sometimes days ago or weeks ago years ago even decades ago

And these people that I interview

they haven't closed themselves around this loss

and made it the center of their lives

They've lived their worlds have kept spinning

But they're talking to me a total stranger

about the person they love who has died

because these are the experiences

that mark us and make us just as much as the joyful ones

And just as permanently

Long after you get your last sympathy card

or your last hot dish

Like we don't look at the people around us

experiencing life's joys and wonders and tell them to move on do we

We don't send a card that's like Congratulations on your beautiful baby

and then five years later think like Another birthday party Get over it
 
Laughter

Yeah we get it he's five

Laughter

Wow

Laughter

But grief is kind of one of those things

like falling in love or having a baby or watching The Wire on HBO
HBO
where you don't get it until you get it until you do it

And once you do it once it's your love or your baby

once it's your grief and your front row at the funeral

you get it

You understand what you're experiencing is not a moment in time

it's not a bone that will reset

but that you've been touched by something chronic

Something incurable

It's not fatal but sometimes grief feels like it could be

And if we can't prevent it in one another

what can we do

What can we do other than try to remind one another

that some things can't be fixed

and not all wounds are meant to heal

We need each other to remember

to help each other remember

that grief is this multitasking emotion

That you can and will be sad and happy you'll be grieving and able to love
 
in the same year or week the same breath

We need to remember that a grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again

If they're lucky they'll even find love again

But yes absolutely they're going to move forward

But that doesn't mean that they've moved on

Thank you

Applause

Do you remember your first kiss

Or that time you burned the roof of your mouth

on a hot slice of pizza

What about playing tag or duck duck goose as a child

These are all instances where we're using touch to understand something

And it's the basis of haptic design

Haptic means of or relating to the sense of touch

And we've all been using that our entire lives

I was working on my computer when my friend

seeing me hunched over typing walked over behind me

She put her left thumb into the left side of my lower back

while reaching her right index finger around to the front of my right shoulder

Instinctively I sat up straight

In one quick and gentle gesture

she had communicated how to improve my posture

The paper I was working on at that very moment

centered around developing new ways to teach movement using technology

I wanted to create a suit that could teach a person kung fu

Laughter

But I had no idea how to communicate movement

without an instructor being in the room

And in that moment it became crystal clear touch

If I had vibrating motors where she had placed each of her fingers

paired with motioncapture data of my current and optimal posture

I could simulate the entire experience

without an instructor needing to be in the room

But there was still one important part of the puzzle that was missing

If I want you to raise your wrist two inches off of your lap

using vibration

how do I tell you to do that

Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist so you know to lift up

Or do I put one at the bottom of your wrist

so it feels like you're being pushed up

There were no readily available answers

because there was no commonly agreedupon haptic language

to communicate information with

So my cofounders and I set out to create that language

And the first device we built was not a kung fu suit

Laughter

But in a way it was even more impressive

because of its simplicity and usefulness

We started with the use case of navigation

which is a simplified form of movement

We then created Wayband
Wayband
a wristwearable device that could orient a user toward a destination

using vibrating cues

We would ask people to spin around

and to stop in a way that they felt was the right way to go

Informally we tried this with hundreds of people

and most could figure it out within about  seconds

It was that intuitive

Initially we were just trying to get people out of their phones

and back into the real world

But the more we experimented

the more we realized that those who stood to benefit most from our work

were people who had little or no sight

When we first approached a blind organization they told us

Don't build a blind device

Build a device that everyone can use

but that's optimized for the blind experience

We created our company WearWorks with three guiding principles
WearWorks
make cool stuff

create the greatest impact we can in our lifetimes

and reimagine an entire world designed for touch

And on November  

Wayband helped a person who was blind

run the first  miles of the New York City Marathon

without any sighted assistance

Applause

It didn't get him through the entire race due to the heavy rain

but that didn't matter

Laughter

We had proved the point

that it was possible to navigate a complex route using only touch

So why touch

The skin has an innate sensitivity

akin to the eyes' ability to recognize millions of colors

or the ears' ability to recognize complex pitch and tone

Yet as a communications channel

it's been largely relegated to Morse codelike cell phone notifications

If you were to suddenly receive a kiss or a punch

your reaction would be instinctive and immediate

Meanwhile your brain would be playing catchup on the back end

to understand the details of what just occurred

And compared to instincts conscious thought is pretty slow

But it's a lightning bolt

compared to the snail's pace of language acquisition

I spent a considerable amount of time

learning Spanish Japanese German and currently Swedish

with varying degrees of failure

Laughter

But within those failures were kernels of how different languages are organized

That gave our team insight

into how to use the linguistic order of wellestablished languages

as inspiration for an entirely new haptic language

one based purely on touch

It also showed us when using language mechanics wasn't the best way

to deliver information

In the same way a smile is a smile across every culture

what if there was some underlying mechanism of touch

that transcended linguistic and cultural boundaries

A universal language of sorts

You see I could give you buzzbuzzbuzz buzzbuzz

and you would eventually learn

that that particular vibration means stop

But as haptic designers we challenged ourselves

What would it be like to design stop

Well based on context

most of us have the experience of being in a vehicle

and having that vehicle stop suddenly along with our body's reaction to it

So if I wanted you to stop

I could send you a vibration pattern sure

Or I could design a haptic experience

that just made stopping feel like it was the right thing to do

And that takes more than an arbitrary assignment of haptic cues to meanings

It takes a deep empathy

It also takes the ability to distill human experience into meaningful insights

and then into haptic gestures and products

Haptic design is going to expand the human ability

to sense and respond to our environments

both physical and virtual

There's a new frontier touch

And it has the power to change how we all see the world around us

Thank you

Applause

I'm an astronomer who builds telescopes

I build telescopes because number one they are awesome

But number two

I believe if you want to discover a new thing about the universe

you have to look at the universe

in a new way

New technologies in astronomy 

things like lenses photographic plates

all the way up to space telescopes 

each gave us new ways to see the universe

and directly led to a new understanding

of our place in it

But those discoveries come with a cost

It took thousands of people and  years

to get the Hubble Space Telescope from an idea into orbit

It takes time

it takes a tolerance for failure

it takes individual people

choosing every day not to give up

I know how hard that choice is because I live it

The reality of my job is that I fail almost all the time and still keep going

because that's how telescopes get built

The telescope I helped build is called

the faint intergalacticmedium redshifted emission balloon

which is a mouthful

so we call it FIREBall

And don't worry it is not going to explode at the end of this story

I've been working on FIREBall for more than  years

and now lead the team of incredible people who built it

FIREBall is designed to observe some of the faintest structures known

huge clouds of hydrogen gas

These clouds are giant

They are even bigger than whatever you're thinking of

They are huge

huge clouds of hydrogen that we think flow into and out of galaxies

I work on FIREBall

because what I really want is to take our view of the universe

from one with just light from stars

to one where we can see and measure every atom that exists

That's all that I want to do

Laughter

But observing at least some of those atoms

is crucial to our understanding of why galaxies look the way they do

I want to know

how that hydrogen gas gets into a galaxy and creates a star

My work on FIREBall started in 

working not on the telescope but on the light sensor

which is the heart of any telescope

This new sensor was being developed by a team that I joined

at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
NASA
And our goal was to prove that this sensor would work really well

to detect that hydrogen gas

In my work on this

I destroyed several very very very expensive sensors

before realizing that the machine I was using

created a plasma that shorted out anything electrical that we put in it

We used a different machine there were other challenges

and it took years to get it right

But when that first sensor worked

it was glorious

And our sensors are now  times better than the previous state of the art

and are getting put into all kinds of new telescopes

Our sensors will give us a new way to see the universe and our place in it

So sensors done

time to build a telescope

And FIREBall is weird as far as telescopes go

because it's not in space and it's not on the ground

Instead it hangs on a cable from a giant balloon

and observes for one night only

from  feet in the stratosphere

at the very edge of space

This is partly because the edge of space is much cheaper than actual space

Laughter

So building it of course more failures

mirrors that failed

scratched mirrors that had to be remade

cooling system failures

an entire system that had to be remade

calibration failures we ran tests again and again and again and again

failures when you literally least expect them

we had an adorable but super angry baby falcon that landed

on our spectrograph tank one day

Laughter

Although to be fair this was the greatest day

in the history of this project

Laughter

I really loved that falcon

But falcon damage fixed we got it built

for an August  launch attempt 

and then failed to launch

due to six weeks of continuous rain in the New Mexico desert

Laughter

Our spirits dampened we showed up again

August  year 

And on the morning of September nd

we finally got the telescope launched

Applause

I have put so much of myself  my whole life  into this project

and I like still can't believe that that happened

And I have this picture that's taken right around sunset on that day

of our balloon

FIREBall hanging from it

and the nearly full moon

And I love this picture

God I love it

But I look at it

and it makes me want to cry

because when fully inflated these balloons are spherical

and this one isn't

It's shaped like a teardrop

And that's because there is a hole in it

Sometimes balloons fail too

FIREBall crashlanded in the New Mexico desert

and we didn't get the data that we wanted

And at the end of that day I thought to myself

Why am I doing this

And I've thought a lot about why since that day

And I've realized that all of my work has been full of things

that break and fail

that we don't understand and they fail

that we just get wrong the first time

and so they fail

I think about the thousands of people who built Hubble

and how many failures they endured

There were countless failures heartbreaking failures

even when it was in space

And none of those failures were a reason for them to give up

I think about why I love my job

I want to know what is happening in the universe

You all want to know what's happening in the universe too

I want to know what's going on with that hydrogen

And so I've realized that discovery is mostly a process

of finding things that don't work

and failure is inevitable when you're pushing the limits of knowledge

And that's what I want to do

So I'm choosing to keep going

And our team is going to do

what everyone who has ever built anything before us has done

we're going to try again

in 

And it might feel like a failure today  and it really does 

but it's only going to stay a failure

if I give up

Thank you very much

Applause

When I look in the mirror today

I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University

a youth mentor an activist

and a future New York state senator

Cheering

I see all of that

and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison 

six years to be exact

starting as a teenager on Rikers Island

for an act that nearly cost a man his life

But what got me from there to here

wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison

or the harshness of our legal system

Instead it was a learning environment of a classroom

that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me

or our justice system as a whole

A few weeks before my release on parole

a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course

being offered in the prison

It was called Inside Criminal Justice

That seems pretty straightforward though right

Well it turns out

the class would be made up of eight incarcerated men

and eight assistant district attorneys

Columbia University psychology professor Geraldine Downey

and Manhattan Assistant DA Lucy Lang

cotaught the course

and it was the first of its kind

I can honestly say

this wasn't how I imagined starting college

My mind was blown from day one

I assumed all the prosecutors in the room would be white

But I remember walking into the room on the first day of class

and seeing three black prosecutors

and thinking to myself

Wow being a black prosecutor 

that's a thing

Laughter

By the end of the first session

I was all in

In fact a few weeks after my release

I found myself doing something I prayed I wouldn't

I walked right back into prison

But thankfully this time it was just as a student

to join my fellow classmates

And this time

I got to go home when class was over

In the next session we talked about what had brought each of us

to this point of our lives

and into the classroom together

I eventually got comfortable enough

to reveal my truth to everyone in the room

about where I came from

I talked about how my sisters and I watched our mother suffer years of abuse

at the hands of our stepfather

escaping only to find ourselves living in a shelter

I talked about how I swore an oath to my family

to keep them safe

I even explained how I didn't feel like a teenager at 

but more like a soldier on a mission

And like any soldier

this meant carrying an emotional burden on my shoulders

and I hate to say it

but a gun on my waist

And just a few days after my th birthday

that mission completely failed

As my sister and I were walking to the laundromat

a crowd stopped in front of us

Two girls out of nowhere attacked my sister

Still confused about what was happening I tried to pull one girl away

and just as I did I felt something brush across my face

With my adrenaline rushing

I didn't realize a man had leaped out of the crowd and cut me

As I felt warm blood ooze down my face

and watching him raise his knife toward me again

I turned to defend myself and pulled that gun from my waistband

and squeezed the trigger

Thankfully he didn't lose his life that day

My hands shaking and heart racing I was paralyzed in fear

From that moment

I felt regret that would never leave me

I learned later on they attacked my sister in a case of mistaken identity

thinking she was someone else

It was terrifying

but clear that I wasn't trained nor was I qualified

to be the soldier that I thought I needed to be

But in my neighborhood

I only felt safe carrying a weapon

Now back in the classroom after hearing my story

the prosecutors could tell I never wanted to hurt anyone

I just wanted us to make it home

I could literally see the gradual change in each of their faces

as they heard story after story

from the other incarcerated men in the room

Stories that have trapped many of us

within the vicious cycle of incarceration

that most haven't been able to break free of

And sure  there are people who commit terrible crimes

But the stories of these individuals' lives

before they commit those acts

were the kinds of stories these prosecutors had never heard

And when it was their turn to speak  the prosecutors 

I was surprised too

They weren't emotionless drones or robocops

preprogrammed to send people to prison

They were sons and daughters

brothers and sisters

But most of all they were good students

They were ambitious and motivated

And they believed that they could use the power of law to protect people

They were on a mission that I could definitely understand

Midway through the course Nick a fellow incarcerated student

poured out his concern

that the prosecutors were tiptoeing around the racial bias and discrimination

within our criminal justice system

Now if you've ever been to prison

you would know it's impossible to talk about justice reform

without talking about race

So we silently cheered for Nick

and were eager to hear the prosecutors' response

And no I don't remember who spoke first

but when Chauncey Parker a senior prosecutor agreed with Nick

and said he was committed to ending the mass incarceration of people of color

I believed him

And I knew we were headed in the right direction

We now started to move as a team

We started exploring new possibilities

and uncovering truths about our justice system

and how real change

happens for us

For me it wasn't the mandatory programs inside of the prison

Instead it was listening to the advice of elders 

men who have been sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison

These men helped me reframe my mindset around manhood

And they instilled in me all of their aspirations and goals

in the hopes that I would never return to prison

and that I would serve as their ambassador to the free world

As I talked I could see the lights turning on for one prosecutor

who said something I thought was obvious

that I had transformed despite my incarceration

and not because of it

It was clear these prosecutors hadn't thought much about

what happens to us after they win a conviction

But through the simple process of sitting in a classroom

these lawyers started to see that keeping us locked up

didn't benefit our community

or us

Toward the end of the course the prosecutors were excited

as we talked about our plans for life after being released

But they hadn't realized how rough it was actually going to be

I can literally still see the shock

on one of the junior ADA's face when it hit her
ADA
the temporary ID given to us with our freedom

displayed that we were just released from prison

She hadn't imagined how many barriers this would create for us

as we reenter society

But I could also see her genuine empathy for the choice we had to make

between coming home to a bed in a shelter

or a couch in a relative's overcrowded apartment

What we learned in the class

worked its way into concrete policy recommendations

We presented our proposals

to the state Department of Corrections commissioner

and to the Manhattan DA

at our graduation in a packed Columbia auditorium

As a team

I couldn't have imagined a more memorable way

to conclude our eight weeks together

And just  months after coming home from prison

I again found myself in a strange room

invited by the commissioner of NYPD to share my perspective

at a policing summit

And while speaking

I recognized a familiar face in the audience

It was the attorney who prosecuted my case

Seeing him

I thought about our days in the courtroom

seven years earlier

as I listened to him recommend a long prison sentence

as if my young life was meaningless

and had no potential

But this time

the circumstances were different

I shook off my thoughts

and walked over to shake his hand

He looked happy to see me

Surprised but happy

He acknowledged how proud he was about being in that room with me

and we began a conversation about working together

to improve the conditions of our community

And so today

I carry all of these experiences with me

as I develop the Justice Ambassadors Youth Council at Columbia University

bringing young New Yorkers  some who have already spent time locked up

and others who are still enrolled in high school 

together with city officials

And in this classroom

everyone will brainstorm ideas

about improving the lives of our city's most vulnerable youth

before they get tried within the criminal justice system

This is possible if we do the work

Our society and justice system has convinced us

that we can lock up our problems

and punish our way out of social challenges

But that's not real

Imagine with me for a second

a future where no one can become

a prosecutor

a judge

a cop

or even a parole officer

without first sitting in a classroom

to learn from and connect with

the very people whose lives will be in their hands

I'm doing my part to promote the power of conversations

and the need for collaborations

It is through education

that we will arrive at a truth that is inclusive and unites us all

in the pursuit of justice

For me it was a brandnew conversation

and a new kind of classroom

that showed me how both my mindset

and our criminal justice system

could be transformed

They say the truth shall set you free

But I believe

it's education

and communication

Thank you

About two years ago

I got a phone call that changed my life

Hey this is your cousin Hassen

I froze

You see I have well over  first cousins

but I didn't know anybody named Hassen

It turned out that Hassen was actually my mom's cousin

and had just arrived in Montreal as a refugee

And over the next few months

I would have three more relatives coming to Canada to apply for asylum

with little more than the clothes on their back

And in the two years since that phone call

my life has completely changed

I left academia

and now lead a diverse team of technologists researchers and refugees

that is developing customized selfhelp resources for newcomers

We want to help them overcome language cultural and other barriers

that make them feel like they've lost control over their own lives

And we feel that AI can help restore the rights and the dignity

that many people lose when seeking help

My family's refugee experience is not unique

According to the UNHCR

every minute  people are newly displaced

by climate change economic crisis

and social and political instability

And it was while volunteering at a local YMCA shelter

that my cousin Hassen and other relatives were sent to

that we saw and learned to appreciate

how much effort and coordination resettlement requires

When you first arrive you need to find a lawyer

and fill out legal documents within two weeks

You also need to schedule a medical exam with a preauthorized physician

just so that you can apply for a work permit

And you need to start looking for a place to live

before you receive any sort of social assistance

With thousands fleeing the United States

to seek asylum in Canada over the past few years

we quickly saw what it looks like

when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them

Social services doesn't scale quickly

and even if communities do their best

to help more people with limited resources

newcomers end up spending more time waiting in limbo

not knowing where to turn

In Montreal for example

despite millions of dollars being spent to support resettlement efforts

nearly  percent of newcomers still don't know

that there are free resources that exist

to help them with everything from filling out paperwork

to finding a job

The challenge is not that this information doesn't exist

On the contrary those in need are often bombarded with so much information

that it's difficult to make sense of it all

Don't give me more information just tell me what to do

was a sentiment we heard over and over again

And it reflects how insanely difficult it could be to get your bearings

when you first arrive in a new country

Hell I struggled with the same issues when I got to Montreal

and I have a PhD

Laughter

As another member of our team himself also a refugee put it

In Canada a SIM card is more important than food
SIM
because we will not die from hunger

But getting access to the right resources and information

can be the difference between life and death

Let me say that again

getting access to the right resources and information

can be the difference between life and death

In order to address these issues

we built Atar

the firstever AIpowered virtual advocate

that guides you stepbystep through your first week

of arriving in a new city

Just tell Atar what you need help with

Atar will then ask you some basic questions

to understand your unique circumstances

and determine your eligibility for resources

For example Do you have a place to stay tonight

If not would you prefer an allwomen's shelter

Do you have children

Atar will then generate a custom stepbystep todo list
Atar
that tells you everything that you need to know

from where to go how to get there

what to bring with you

and what to expect

You can ask a question at any time

and if Atar doesn't have an answer

you'll be connected with a real person who does

But what's most exciting

is that we help humanitarian and service organizations

collect the data and the analytics that's necessary to understand

the changing needs of newcomers

in real time

That's a game changer

We've already partnered with the UNHCR

to provide this technology in Canada

and in our work have conducted campaigns in Arabic English

French Creole and Spanish

When we talk about the issue of refugees

we often focus on the official statistic

of  million forcibly displaced worldwide
 
But the reality is much greater than that

By  there will be an additional  million people

who are at risk of being displaced due to environmental degradation

And today  that is today  there are nearly one billion people

who already live in illegal settlements and slums

Resettlement and integration

is one of the greatest challenges of our time

and our hope is that Atar can provide every single newcomer an advocate
Atar
Our hope is that Atar can amplify existing efforts

and alleviate pressure on a social safety net

that's already stretched beyond imagination

But what's most important to us

is that our work helps restore the rights and the dignity

that refugees lose throughout resettlement and integration

by giving them the resources that they need in order to help themselves

Thank you

It gets easier right

These are the words I often hear from young parents

who are new to the game of worrying about their children

I tell them that it doesn't

It gets different

but there's always something to worry about as parents

I remember how I would lie halfawake at night

listening to my son breathe

when he was young and had asthma

and then when he was a teen

until I heard the front door chime open

and I knew that he was home safe

Worrying about our kids comes with the territory

Now many of these worries are about basic issues

like what they eat where they are who they're with

But we also need to keep an eye on new behaviors and fads

The latest craze is something that may not yet be on everyone's radar

as a serious health concern

and that is the newfound popularity of vaping
vaping
or inhaling sweet aerosols

produced by vaporizing eliquids in ecigarettes

Ecigarettes or vapes as they are commonly called

are flying off the shelves like candy

This year the ecigarette market is expected to drive

 billion dollars in sales worldwide

Over the next six years

that volume is expected to double

We have a lot of serious concerns about the health impact of vaping

and unfortunately not nearly enough answers

This becomes even more concerning when you think of who uses ecigarettes

Ecigarette use at least in the US

has grown rapidly among youth and young adults 

our kids

our most vulnerable population

There was a  percent growth in the use of ecigarettes by youth

between  and 

The most recent estimates suggest

that approximately  million high school and middle school students

have used ecigarettes in the US

Now ecigarettes were originally created

to offer smokers a cleaner form of nicotine

to help with their cigarette addiction

In the US these devices come under the FDA's jurisdiction
FDA
as a tobacco product

But the science on these devices has not been able to keep up

with the rapid market growth

so regulations on the components of these devices and eliquids

are lagging

Current regulations do restrict sales of these devices

to anyone under the age of 

but these do not seem to have had much of an impact

on the explosion in the use of these devices by teens

You know the first time I heard of and saw an ecigarette

I knew right away that teens would love it

These devices are technology on a stick

a perfect fit for the smartphone generation 

small rechargeable easy to use easy to modify nice smelling 

some even sync with your smartphone to let you know how much you have vaped

Even I was very drawn to these very clever devices

And since I had spent a long time researching teen and adult addictions

I immediately realized that these devices fit perfectly into the teen psyche

Teens are impulsive and they love to try new things

They're also craving independence and they love to make things their own

Ecigarettes meet these needs perfectly

by allowing them the chance to both innovate and personalize

their vape experience

They can choose from over  different eliquid flavors

and multiple nicotine concentrations

They can even create their own nicotine flavor combination

They can change how much vapor is produced from these devices

by modifying the puff volume and the constituents

and the power and temperature of the devices

They can even use these devices for cloud chasing

Cloud chasing also called vape tricks
vape
or smoke tricks

involves producing large vape clouds with quirky shapes and names

like rings dragons ghosts 

Cloud chasers can even participate in cloud competitions

and win prizes for creating the most innovative shaped clouds

Teens can also change the strength and throat hit from the vapor

by either vaporizing the eliquid at higher temperatures

or dripping the eliquid directly onto a heated coil

They can even use these devices for marijuana vaping

And since the devices use lower temperatures

and do not combust or burn the marijuana

they can do this very discreetly

without the distinctive smell of burnt marijuana

So they can really make these vape experiences their own
vape
which may explain the astounding rise in the use of these devices by youth

Ecigarettes are technically a very simple device

There is a receptacle for the eliquid which can be a tank a pod or a plug

There is a battery that charges the coil which then vaporizes the eliquid

And then there is a mouthpiece

where the user can actually draw from the ecigarette

In  there were  ecigarette devices in the marketplace

These range from cigarettelike devices which are also called cigalikes

to tank systems which are also called pens

And then there are modified devices which are also called mods
MOD
Mods look nothing like a cigarette
MODS
and they come in various shapes and sizes

with different kinds of attachments and user adjustments

They're very popular for cloud chasing

The most recent entrance into the marketplace

are the pod devices

which contain the eliquid in a pod

These are very popular by the way among teens

An example of this is the Juul

which not only looks like a USB device
USB
but can also be plugged into a USB outlet to charge
USB
Many teens do not even think that these are ecigarettes

which has led to the use of terms like juuling instead of vaping
juulingvaping
Many of these devices are so discreet and produce so little vapor

that teens are using them in classrooms

and hiding them in objects like Sharpie pens their clothes

their books

Now many teens think that these devices produce water vapor

and therefore they are safe to use

But this could not be further from the truth

What is produced is not even a vapor

it's an aerosol

and let me tell you the difference is quite pronounced

Aerosols contain many finely suspended particles of liquids and gases

that are created from whatever is in the eliquid

So an aerosol could contain propylene glycol and glycerin

which are solvents in the eliquid
E
Now these solvents are known to be safe for edible use

so for use in products that you eat

but we know very little about their safety following longterm inhalational exposure

The eliquids can also contain alcohol
E
sometimes in high levels

and inhaling alcohol is known to have toxic effects on the brain

I told you earlier that the eliquids contain over  different flavors

Here are some examples

some with very catchy but familiar names like Skittles and Fruit Loops
SkittlesFruit Loops
and others with more exotic names like Dragon's Milk and Tiger's Blood

and Unicorn Puke

The eliquid or the aerosol can also contain metallic particles

like chromium cadmium and lead

These are generated from the heating coil in the devices

and are also known to have many toxic effects on vital organs

So no let me make this very clear

what is produced is definitely not water vapor

Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine through ecigarettes

is also very concerning

The teen brain is very sensitive to even low levels of nicotine

and gets very easily addicted

In fact we have known for a long time

that  percent of smokers start smoking cigarettes prior to the age of 

Those who start early are more addicted and have a harder time quitting smoking

In other words and to quote a past FDA commissioner

Nicotine addiction  is a pediatric disease

Ecigarettes can expose teens to a lot of nicotine

Many of these devices contain the amount of nicotine

that is in a full pack of cigarettes

The more recent pod devices contain a nicotine salt
POD
which has a smoother taste and is much easier to use

and can produce rapid increases in brain nicotine levels

Teens who use ecigarettes regularly report symptoms of craving 

feeling anxious when they don't have their ecigarettes

All these are hallmarks of a behavioral addiction

Ecigarettes are not only addictive

but they also affect many other organs in the body

So nicotine which is in ecigarettes for example

binds to a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor

which plays a key role in the functioning of almost all organ systems

in the human body

And chronic exposure to nicotine changes the functioning of these systems

So as an example

chronic exposure to nicotine decreases the flexibility of the blood vessels

and changes how the heart responds to acute challenges like stress

The teen brain is not only sensitive to the addictive effects of nicotine

but also to its toxic effects

In adolescent animals nicotine is a very wellestablished neurotoxin

and it decreases learning memory and attention processes

and increases hyperactivity symptoms

Teens who use tobacco products are more likely to use

marijuana and alcohol

and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult

So nicotine addiction through ecigarettes could be leading them down the path

of other addictions and other mental health problems

Now in adolescent animals nicotine also produces epigenetic changes

or heritable changes in gene expression

for example in the genes involved in asthma

So teens who use nicotine may not only be harming themselves

but they could be harming their future generations

You know the very existence of ecigarettes

could have led to an entire generation of nicotineaddicted youth

Easy access to these devices could have led to more experimentation

with marijuana and many other vaporizable substances by youth

While there is no doubt that providing smokers with a cleaner form of nicotine

is and should continue to be a critical goal

we still do not know if these devices help smokers quit smoking

and we know very little about the longterm effects of these devices

What we do know is that youth  lots of youth  are using these devices

In fact the FDA commissioner recently used the term epidemic
FDA
to describe ecigarette use in the US

While trying to solve one huge public health problem cigarette smoking

we may have created another colossal one

Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years around cigarette smoking

led to a cigarette epidemic and many many cigaretterelated diseases

We do not want to repeat the same mistakes with ecigarettes

So now is the time for action

for regulations that address the appeal and access of these devices to youth

Do smokers really need  kidfriendly flavors to quit smoking

Do they need so many different kinds of devices

Is it a good idea to have devices which are so easy to hide

and so easy to use

We recently heard that the FDA plans to introduce stricter regulations
FDA
on sales of these devices that contain eliquid flavors

in retail locations like convenience stores and gas stations

and also introduce stricter regulations

on sales of devices to minors over the internet

Is this going to be sufficient to change this rapid increase in youth uptake

We need to ask and answer such critical questions

Now is also the time for a serious public education campaign

Teens and their parents need to know

that while ecigarettes may contain less toxins than cigarettes

they're certainly not benign

Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals produced by these devices

could be changing them in ways they may not like

and setting them up for future unknown toxicities and health problems

You know when I said earlier

that ecigarettes were a perfect fit for the smartphone generation

I was not kidding

We live in a technologycrazed world

where the latest device and technology gets a lot of attention

just because it is technology and because it is the latest thing

More and more over the next few years and for the rest of our lives

we are going to see technologies coming into the marketplace

that may not raise any health flags at first

simply because they don't look unhealthy

or they're not a medical device

For example we could see devices

that may make it easier to go longer without sleep

or help us lose weight 

a personal goal of mine 

or achieve any number of other goals

that we as consumers are very very interested in

But many of these devices may come with unacceptable risks to our own health

So if we want to protect our health and the health of our children

perhaps we should get out of the habit

of automatically celebrating such new technology

and get into the habit of looking at them with a critical eye

perhaps even through a medical lens

Because you know something

Our health the health of our children and our future generations

is far too valuable to let it go up in smoke 

or even in aerosol

Thank you

So what if there were a highly obvious problem

right in front of you

One that everyone was talking about

one that affected you directly

Would you do everything within your power to fix things

before they got worse

Don't be so sure

We are all much more likely than any of us would like to admit

to miss what's right in front of our eyes

And in fact

we're sometimes most likely to turn away from things

precisely because of the threat that they represent to us

in business life and the world

So I want to give you an example from my world economic policy

So when Alan Greenspan was head of the Federal Reserve
Alan GreenspanFederal Reserve
his entire job was to watch out for problems in the US economy

and to make sure that they didn't spin out of control

So after 

when real estate prices peaked

more and more and more respected leaders and institutions

started to sound the alarm bells

about risky lending and dangerous market bubbles

As you know in  it all came tumbling down

Banks collapsed

global stock markets lost nearly half their value

millions and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure

And at the bottom

nearly one in  Americans was out of work

So after things calmed down a little bit

Greenspan and many others came out with a postmortem and said

Nobody could have predicted that crisis

They called it a black swan

Something that was unimaginable

unforeseeable and completely improbable

A total surprise

Except it wasn't always such a surprise

For example my Manhattan apartment nearly doubled in value

in less than four years

I saw the writing on the wall and I sold it

Laughter

Applause

So a lot of other people also saw the warning

spoke out publicly

and they were ignored

So we didn't know exactly what the crisis was going to look like

not the exact parameters

but we could all tell

that the thing coming at us was as dangerous visible and predictable

as a giant gray rhino charging right at us

The black swan lends itself

to the idea that we don't have power over our futures

And unfortunately the less control that we think we have

the more likely we are to downplay it

or ignore it entirely

And this dangerous dynamic masks another problem

that most of the problems that we're facing

are so probable and obvious

they're things that we can see but we still don't do anything about

So I created the gray rhino metaphor

to meet what I felt was an urgent need

To help us to take a fresh look

with the same passion that people had for the black swan

but this time for the things that were highly obvious

highly probable but still neglected

Those are the gray rhinos

Once you start looking for gray rhinos

you see them in the headlines every day

And so what I see in the headlines is another big gray rhino

a new highly probable financial crisis

And I wonder if we've learned anything in the last  years

So if you listen to Washington or Wall Street

you could almost be forgiven for thinking that only smooth sailing laid ahead

But in China where I spend a lot of time

the conversation is totally different

The entire economic team

all the way up to president Xi Jinping himself

talk very specifically and clearly

about financial risks as gray rhinos

and how they can tame them

Now to be sure China and the US

have very very different systems of government

which affects what they're able to do or not

And many of the root causes for their economic problems

are totally different

But it's no secret that both countries have problems

with debt with inequality and with economic productivity

So how come the conversations are so different

You could actually ask this question

not just about countries

but about just about everyone

The auto companies that put safety first

and the ones that don't bother to recall their shoddy cars

until after people die

The grandparents who in preparing for the inevitable 

the ones who have the eulogy written

the menu for the funeral lunch

Laughter

My grandparents did

Laughter

And everything but the final date chiseled into the gravestone

But then you have the grandparents on the other side

who don't put their final affairs in order

who don't get rid of all the junk

they've been hoarding for decades and decades

and leave their kids to deal with it

So what makes the difference between one side and the other

Why do some people see things and deal with them

and the other ones just look away

So the first one has to do with culture society

the people around you

If you think that someone around you

is going to help pick you up when you fall

you're much more likely to see a danger as being smaller

And that allows us to take good chances not just the bad ones

For example like risking criticism

when you talk about the danger that nobody wants you to talk about

Or taking the opportunities that are kind of scary

so in their own way are gray rhinos

So the US has a very individualist culture  go it alone

And paradoxically

this makes many Americans much less open to change

and taking good risks

In China by contrast

people believe that the government is going to keep problems from happening

which might not always be what happens but people believe it

They believe they can rely on their families

so that makes them more likely to take certain risks

Like buying Beijing real estate

or like being more open about the fact that they need to change direction

and in fact the pace of change in China is absolutely amazing

Second of all

how much do you know about a situation

how much are you willing to learn

And are you willing to see things even when it's not what you want

So many of us are so unlikely

to pay attention to the things that we just want to black out

we don't like them

We pay attention to what we want to see what we like what we agree with

But we have the opportunity and the ability

to correct those blind spots

I spend a lot of time talking with people of all walks of life

about the gray rhinos in their life and their attitudes

And you might think

that the people who are more afraid of risk

who are more sensitive to them

would be the ones who would be less open to change

But the opposite is actually true

I've found that the people

who are wiling to recognize the problems around them

and make plans

are the ones who are able to tolerate more risk good risk

and deal with the bad risk

And it's because as we seek information

we increase our power to do something about the things that we're afraid of

And that brings me to my third point

How much control do you feel that you have

over the gray rhinos in your life

One of the reasons we don't act

is that we often feel too helpless

Think of climate change it can feel so big

that not a single one of us could make a difference

So some people go about life denying it

Other people blame everyone except themselves

Like my friend who says he's not ever going to give up his SUV

until they stop building coal plants in China

But we have an opportunity to change

No two of us are the same

Every single one of us has the opportunity to change our attitudes

our own and those of people around us

So today I want to invite all of you

to join me in helping to spark an open and honest conversation

with the people around you

about the gray rhinos in our world

and be brutally honest about how well we're dealing with them

I hear so many times in the States

Well of course we should deal with obvious problems

but if you don't see what's in front of you

you're either dumb or ignorant

That's what they say and I could not disagree more

If you don't see what's in front of you

you're not dumb you're not ignorant

you're human

And once we all recognize that shared vulnerability

that gives us the power to open our eyes

to see what's in front of us

and to act before we get trampled

When I was a child

every other Friday

I would leave my mother and stepfather's home 

an Indian and British atheist Buddhist

agnostic vegetarian new agey sometimes

Democratic household

And I would go  miles to my father and stepmother's home

and enter a white Evangelical Christian

conservative Republican

twiceaweekchurchgoing

meateating family

It doesn't take a shrink to explain how I ended up

in the field of conflict resolution

Laughter

Whether I was facilitating dialogues in Charlottesville or Istanbul

or Ahmedabad

the challenge was always the same

despite all odds

and with integrity

how do you get people to connect meaningfully

to take risks

to be changed by their experience

And I would witness extraordinarily beautiful electricity in those rooms

And then I would leave those rooms

and attend my everyday gatherings like all of you 

a wedding or a conference or a backtoschool picnic 

and many would fall flat

There was a meaning gap

between these highintensity conflict groups

and my everyday gatherings

Now you could say sure somebody's birthday party

isn't going to live up to a race dialogue

but that's not what I was responding to

As a facilitator

you're taught to strip everything away

and focus on the interaction between people

whereas everyday hosts focus on getting the things right 

the food the flowers the fish knives 

and leave the interaction between people largely to chance

So I began to wonder how we might change our everyday gatherings

to focus on making meaning by human connection

not obsessing with the canaps

And I set out and interviewed dozens of brave and unusual hosts 

an Olympic hockey coach a Cirque du Soleil choreographer

a rabbi a camp counselor

to better understand what creates meaningful

and even transformative gatherings

And I want to share with you some of what I learned today

about the new rules of gathering

So when most people plan a gathering

they start with an offtherack format

Birthday party Cake and candles
 
Board meeting

One brown table  white men

Laughter

Assuming the purpose is obvious we skip too quickly to form

This not only leads to dull and repetitive gatherings

it misses a deeper opportunity

to actually address our needs

The first step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings

is to embrace a specific disputable purpose

An expectant mother I know was dreading her baby shower

The idea of pin the diaper on the baby games

and opening gifts felt odd and irrelevant

So she paused to ask

What is the purpose of a baby shower

What is my need at this moment

And she realized it was to address her fears

of her and her husband's  remember that guy 
 
transition to parenthood

And so she asked two friends to invent a gathering based on that

And so on a sunny afternoon six women gathered

And first to address her fear of labor  she was terrified 

they told her stories from her life

to remind her of the characteristics she already carries 

bravery wonder faith surrender 

that they believed would carry her and help her in labor as well

And as they spoke they tied a bead for each quality into a necklace

that she could wear around her neck in the delivery room

Next her husband came in

and they wrote new vows family vows and spoke them aloud

first committing to keep their marriage central

as they transitioned to parenthood

but also future vows to their future son

of what they wanted to carry with them from each of their family lines

and what would stop with this generation

Then more friends came along including men for a dinner party

And in lieu of gifts they each brought a favorite memory from their childhood

to share with the table

Now you might be thinking this is a lot for a baby shower

or it's a little weird or it's a little intimate

Good

It's specific

It's disputable

It's specific to them

just as your gathering should be specific to you

The next step of creating more meaningful everyday gatherings

is to cause good controversy

You may have learned as I did

never to talk about sex politics or religion at the dinner table

It's a good rule in that it preserves harmony

or that's its intention

But it strips away a core ingredient of meaning which is heat

burning relevance

The best gatherings learn to cultivate good controversy

by creating the conditions for it

because human connection is as threatened by unhealthy peace

as by unhealthy conflict

I was once working with an architecture firm

and they were at a crossroads

They had to figure out whether they wanted to continue to be an architecture firm

and focus on the construction of buildings

or pivot and become the hot new thing a design firm

focusing on beyond the construction of spaces

And there was real disagreement in the room

but you wouldn't know because no one was actually speaking up publicly

And so we hosted good controversy

After a lunch break all the architects came back

and we hosted a cage match

They walked in

we took one architect put him in one corner to represent architecture

the other one to represent design

We threw white towels around their necks

stolen from the bathroom  sorry 

played Rocky music on an iPad
iPad
got each a Don Kinglike manager

to rev them up and prepare them with counterarguments

and then basically made them each argue the best possible argument

of each future vision

The norm of politeness was blocking their progress

And we then had everybody else physically choose a side

in front of their colleagues

And because they were able to actually show where they stood

they broke an impasse

Architecture won

So that's work

What about a hypothetical tense Thanksgiving dinner

Anyone

Laughter

So first ask the purpose

What does this family need this year

If cultivating good heat is part of it

then try for a night banning opinions and asking for stories instead

Choose a theme related to the underlying conflict

But instead of opinions

ask everybody to share a story from their life and experience

that nobody around the table has ever heard

to difference or to belonging

or to a time I changed my mind

giving people a way in to each other

without burning the house down

And finally to create more meaningful everyday gatherings

create a temporary alternative world

through the use of popup rules

A few years ago I started noticing invitations coming with a set of rules

Kind of boring or controlling right

Wrong

In this multicultural intersectional society

where more of us are gathered and raised

by people and with etiquette unlike our own

where we don't share the etiquette

unspoken norms are trouble

whereas popup rules allow us to connect meaningfully

They're onetimeonly constitutions for a specific purpose

So a team dinner

where different generations are gathering

and don't share the same assumptions of phone etiquette

whoever looks at their phone first

foots the bill

Laughter

Try it

Applause

For an entrepreneurial advice circle of just strangers

where the hosts don't want everybody to just listen

to the one venture capitalist in the room 

Laughter

knowing laugh 

Laughter

you can't reveal what you do for a living

For a mom's dinner

where you want to upend the norms

of what women who also happen to be mothers talk about when they gather

if you talk about your kids you have to take a shot

Laughter

That's a real dinner

Rules are powerful

because they allow us to temporarily change and harmonize our behavior

And in diverse societies

popup rules carry special force

They allow us to gather across difference

to connect

to make meaning together

without having to be the same

When I was a child

I navigated my two worlds by becoming a chameleon

If somebody sneezed in my mother's home

I would say Bless you

in my father's God bless you

To protect myself I hid

as so many of us do

And it wasn't until I grew up and through conflict work

that I began to stop hiding

And I realized that gatherings for me

at their best

allow us to be among others

to be seen for who we are

and to see

The way we gather matters

because how we gather

is how we live

Thank you

I met  startup founders last year

And each one was looking for money

As a tech investor

my goal was to sort through everyone that I met

and make a quick determination

about which ones had the potential to make something really big

But what makes a great founder

This is a question I ask myself daily

Some venture capitalists place bets

based on a founder's previous background

Did they go to an Ivy League school

Have they worked at a bluechip company

Have they built out a big vision before

Effectively how smart is this person

Other VCs asses a founder's emotional quotient or EQ

How well will this person build teams

and build rapport across customers and clients

I have a different methodology to assess startup founders though

and it's not complicated

I look for signs of one specific trait

Not IQ not EQ

It's adaptability

how well a person reacts to the inevitability of change

and lots of it

That's the single most important determinant for me

I subscribe to the belief

that adaptability itself is a form of intelligence

and our adaptability quotient or AQ
AQ
is something that can be measured tested and improved

AQ isn't just useful for startup founders however
AQ
I think it's increasingly important for all of us

Because the world is speeding up

We know that the rate of technological change is accelerating

which is forcing our brains to react

Whether you're navigating changing job conditions

brought on by automation

shifting geopolitics in a more globalized world

or simply changing family dynamics and personal relationships

Each of us as individuals groups

corporations and even governments

are being forced to grapple with more change

than ever before in human history

So how do we assess our adaptability

I use three tricks when meeting with founders

Here's the first

Think back to your most recent job interview

What kind of questions were you asked

Probably some variation of Tell me about a time when right

Instead to interview for adaptability

I like to ask what if questions

What if your main revenue stream were to dry up overnight

What if a heat wave prevented every single customer

from being able to visit your store

Asking what if instead of asking about the past

forces the brain to simulate

To picture multiple possible versions of the future

The strength of that vision

as well as how many distinct scenarios someone can conjure tells me a lot

Practicing simulations is a sort of safe testing ground

for improving adaptability

Instead of testing how you take in and retain information

like an IQ test might

it tests how you manipulate information

given a constraint

in order to achieve a specific goal

The second trick that I use to assess adaptability in founders

is to look for signs of unlearning

Active unlearners seek to challenge what they presume to already know

and instead override that data with new information

Kind of like a computer running a disk cleanup

Take the example of Destin Sandlin
Destin Sandlin
who programed his bicycle to turn left when he steered it right

and vice versa

He called this his Backwards Brain Bike

and it took him nearly eight months

just to learn how to ride it kind of sort of normally

The fact that Destin was able to unlearn his regular bike

in favor of a new one though

signals something awesome about our adaptability

It's not fixed

Instead each of us has the capacity to improve it

through dedication and hard work

On the last page of Gandhi's autobiography he wrote

I must reduce myself to zero

At many points in his very full life

he was still seeking to return to a beginner's mindset to zero

To unlearn

In this way I think it's pretty safe to say

Gandhi had a high AQ score
AQ
Laughter

The third and final trick

that I use to assess a founder's adaptability

is to look for people who infuse exploration

into their life and their business

There's a sort of natural tension between exploration and exploitation

And collectively

all of us tend to overvalue exploitation

Here's what I mean

In the year 

a man finagled his way into a meeting with John Antioco

the CEO of Blockbuster

and proposed a partnership

to manage Blockbuster's fledgling online business

The CEO John laughed him out of the room saying

I have millions of existing customers

and thousands of successful retail stores

I really need to focus on the money

The other man in the meeting however

turned out to be Reed Hastings the CEO of Netflix
NetflixReed Hastings
In  Netflix brought in  billion dollars
Netflix
while Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 

directly  years after that meeting

The Blockbuster CEO

was too focused on exploiting his already successful business model

so much so that he couldn't see around the next corner

In that way his previous success

became the enemy of his adaptability potential

For the founders that I work with

I frame exploration as a state of constant seeking

To never fall too far in love with your wins

but rather continue to proactively seek out what might kill you next

When I first started exploring adaptability

the thing I found most exciting is that we can improve it

Each of us has the capacity to become more adaptable

But think of it like a muscle

it's got to be exercised

And don't get discouraged if it takes a while

Remember Destin Sandlin

It took him eight months just to learn how to ride a bike

Over time using the tricks that I use on founders 

asking what if questions actively unlearning

and prioritizing exploration over exploitation

can put you in the driver's seat 

so that the next time something big changes

you're already prepared

We're entering a future where IQ and EQ
IQEQ
both matter way less than how fast you're able to adapt

So I hope that these tools help you to raise your own AQ
AQ
Thank you

I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar who is a fellow poet
Kaveh Akbar
And Kaveh found this photo online

of the anatomical heart of a blue whale

that scientists had hung on a hook from the ceiling

which is how they were able to observe that the heart of a blue whale

is big enough that a person can stand up fully inside of it

And when Kaveh shared this photo online
Kaveh
he did so with the caption

This is another reminder

that the universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing

And when I first saw that I was horrified

I was like Come on man I'm trying to invent new metaphors
 
I'm trying to discover beauty that hasn't been discovered yet

What do you mean the universe is always going to get there before me

And I know this isn't a uniquely poet problem

but on days when the world feels especially big

or especially impossible

or especially full of grandeur

those are the days when I feel

What do I possibly have to contribute

to all of this

Not long ago I saw this video that some of you may have seen

It makes the internet rounds every couple of months

There are these birds that are called starlings

and they fly in what's called a murmuration

which is generally just a big cloud of birds

And someone happened to catch a quick video on their phone

of these starlings flying

And at first it's just an amorphous blob

and then there's a moment where the birds shift

and they form the shape of a starling

in the sky

Laughter

And as soon as I saw it I was like

Gasps The universe has already written the poem

you were planning on writing

Laughter

Except for the first time it didn't fill me with despair

Instead I thought OK

Maybe it's not my job to invent something new

Maybe instead it's my job to listen to what the universe is showing me

and to keep myself open to what the universe offers

so that when it's my turn

I can hold something to the light

just for a moment

just for as long as I have

The universe has already written the poem

that you were planning on writing

And this is why

you can do nothing but point at the flock of starlings

whose bodies rise and fall in inherited choreography

swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain

that for one blistering moment

forms the unmistakeable shape

of a giant bird

flapping against the sky

It is why your mouth forms an o

that is not a gasp

but rather the beginning of

Oh Of course

As in of course the heart of a blue whale is as large as a house

with chambers tall enough to fit a person standing

Of course a fig becomes possible

when a lady wasp lays her eggs inside a flower

dies and decomposes

the fruit evidence of her transformation

Sometimes the poem is so bright

your silly language will not stick to it

Sometimes the poem is so true

nobody will believe you

I am a bird

made of birds

This blue heart a house you can stand up inside of

I am dying

here

inside this flower

It is OK

It is what I was put here to do

Take this fruit

It is what I have to offer

It may not be first

or ever best

but it is the only way to be sure

that I lived at all

Applause

On Tuesday January  

I walked into the office of the president

as head of state of the Republic of Sierra Leone

I had not been elected

Four years earlier

I was one of  heavily armed military officers

all in our s

who had driven from the war front

into the capital city Freetown

We had only one objective

to overthrow a corrupt repressive and singleparty dictatorship

that had kept itself in power for over  years

But in the end it wasn't a violent coup

After we fired a few shots and seized the radio station

hundreds of thousands of citizens jumped onto the streets

to welcome us as liberators

If you are thinking this seems like a movie script I'm with you

I was part of the ruling military government

and I served in several roles

Our goal was always to return the country to democratic civilian rule

But after four years

those multiparty democratic elections had still not happened

Citizens were beginning to lose faith in our promise

But you know what

I like to keep my promises

Some of my comrades and I staged another military coup

and this time against our own head of state and commander

Again it was a bloodless coup

That is how I became the new military head of state

on January  

I was still only  years old

Of course power was sweet

I felt invulnerable

I had thousands of heavily armed men

and aircraft at my command

I was heavily protected

and I lived in luxury

But my obligations to my nation were always superior

Millions of fellow citizens were either displaced

or fleeing the violence and pillage of war

So I engaged in a series of diplomatic activities

right across the subregion

and convinced the reclusive rebel leader to initiate peace talks

for the very first time

I also called a national consultative conference

of civil society organizations and stakeholders

to advise on the best way forward

In both cases I shared with them

what I believed in then and now

that Sierra Leone is bigger than all of us

and that Sierra Leone must be a secure peaceful and just society

where every person can thrive

and contribute to national development

And so I initiated peace talks with the rebels

I organized the first multiparty democratic elections in nearly  years

Applause

I handed over power

to the newly elected president

I retired from the army

and I left my country for the United States of America

to study 

all in three months

Applause

In many a long walk

I wondered how we could get it right again as a nation

More than  years later

in April 

with a few more wrinkles and grey hair

I was again head of state

But guess what

This time I have been democratically elected

Applause

At the polling stations last year

my threeyearold daughter Amina was in my arm

She insisted on holding on to my ballot paper with me

She was intent and focused

At that moment

with my ballot papers in both our hands

I fully understood the one priority for me

if I was elected president of the Republic of Sierra Leone

that is How could I make the lives of Amina

and millions of other young girls and boys

better in our country

See I believe that leadership is about creating possibilities that everyone

especially the young people

can believe in

own

work to actualize

and which they can actively fight to protect

The pathway to power and leadership

can be littered with impediments

but more often with funny questions that may seemingly defy answers

How does one take on the unique challenges of a country like Sierra Leone

We had mined mineral resources for over a hundred years

but we still are poor

We had collected foreign aid for  years but we are still poor

The secret to economic development is in nature's best resource

skilled healthy and productive human beings

The secret to changing our country lay in enhancing and supporting

the limitless potential of the next generation

and challenging them to change our country

Human capital development was the key to national development

in Sierra Leone

As a candidate

I met with and listened to many young men and women

right across the country

and in the diaspora

that were feeling disconnected from political leadership

and cared little about the future of our country

How could we engage them

and make them believe that the answers to transforming our nation

was right in their hands

Immediately after becoming president

I appointed some of Sierra Leone's brightest young people as leaders

with responsibility to realize our shared vision

of transforming Sierra Leone

I am grateful many of them said yes

Let me give you a few examples

Corruption had been endemic in governance institutions

and in public life in Sierra Leone

undermining public trust

and the country's international reputation

I appointed a young attorney as Commissioner

for the AntiCorruption Commission

In less than a year

he had a hundred percent conviction rate

and recovered over  million dollars of stolen money

That is seed money for building the country's firstever

national medical diagnostic center in Sierra Leone

Applause

The Millennium Challenge Corporation recently gave us a green scorecard

for the Control of Corruption indicator

and multilateral development partners that had left Sierra Leone

are now beginning to return

We are determined to break a culture of corruption

and the culture of impunity

that is associated with corruption

Before I became president

I met a skinny dreadlocked MITHarvardtrained inventor

in London

Over coffee I challenged him to think and plan along with me

how innovation could help to drive national development

in the areas of governance revenue mobilization health care

education delivering public services
Education delivering public services
and supporting private sector growth

How could Sierra Leone participate in the digital economy

and become an innovation hub

Guess what

He left his cozy job at IBM
IBM
and he now leads a team of young men and women

within the newly established Directorate of Science Technology and Innovation

in my own office

Applause

That young man is right in here

I challenged another young Sierra Leonean woman

to set up and lead the new Ministry of Planning and Economic Development

She consulted widely with Sierra Leoneans and produced in record time

the mediumterm national development plan

titled Education For Development

We now have our national development needs

in easily understandable clusters

and we can now plan our budgets

align development partner contributions

and measure our own progress

But the story of my government's flagship program

is even more daring

if I can call it that

Today three out of five adults in Sierra Leone cannot read or write

Thousands of children were not able to go to school

or had dropped out of school

because their parents could just not afford the  school fees per year

Women and girls who constitute  percent of our population

were not given equal opportunity to be educated

So the obvious answer is to put in place free quality education

for every Sierra Leonean child

regardless of gender ability or ethnicity

Applause

Great idea you've clapped for

Right

But the only problem is we had no money to start the program

Laughter

Absolutely nothing

Development partners wanted to see data before associating with my vision

Of course political opponents laughed at me

But I campaigned that a nation

that invests in human capital development

through free quality education

affordable and highquality health care services

and food security

will accelerate its national development program

I argued that for Sierra Leone to produce a highly skilled

innovative and productive workforce

fit for the st century global economy

we needed to invest heavily in human capital development in Sierra Leone

But we had no money

because the previous government had virtually emptied the coffers

We clamped down on corruption

closed up the loopholes for fraud and waste

and we watched the money build up

We successfully launched a free quality education program

in August last year

four years four months later

Today two million children are going to school

Applause

Twentyone percent of the national budget

supports free quality education

In close collaboration and in partnership with development partners

we have now provided teaching and learning materials

safe spaces for girls

and started implementing school feeding programs

across the entire country

We have even paid backlogs of salaries for teachers

Any girl admitted to university to study science technology

engineering mathematics and other related disciplines

receives a full scholarship in Sierra Leone today

Applause

And here is why this matters

in a few years we will have a healthier better educated

and highly skilled young population

that will lead and drive the country's national development

They will be wellequipped to deploy science technology and innovation

Then we'll attract investment in diversified areas of our economy

from tourism to fisheries

and from renewable energy to manufacturing

That is my biggest bet

In my mind this is what leadership is all about

a mission to listen with empathy

to the craziest of ideas

the hopes and aspirations of a younger generation

who are just looking for a chance to be better

and to make our country better

It is about letting them know

that their dreams matter

It is about standing with them and asking Why not

when they ask seemingly impossible questions

It is about exploring making

and owning a shared vision

The most audacious and nationchanging events

or policies or even personal choices

happen when we ask Why not

then make bold choices and ensure those bold choices happen

I wake up every day believing

that our country should no longer be defined by the stigma of the past

The future offers hope and opportunity for all

It matters to me that young men and women right across the country

can imagine for themselves that they too can be and are

part of the story of our nation

I want to challenge them to build a nation

where threeyearolds like my daughter Yie Amie
Yie Amie
can grow up in good governance

quality education

health care

and good infrastructure

I want our children to become young men and women

who can continue nourishing the trees that will grow

from the seeds that we are planting today

Now can someone tell me

why we should not dare imagine that future in Sierra Leone

Thank you

Applause

Do you think the things we build today

will be considered wonders in the future

Think of Stonehenge

the Pyramids

Machu Picchu and Easter Island

Now they're all pretty different from what we're doing today

with those massive stones

assembled in complex but seemingly illogical ways

and all traces of their construction

erased

shrouding them in mystery

It seems like people could not have possibly built these things

because people didn't

They were carefully crafted by a primordial race of giants

known as Cyclops

Laughter

And I've been collaborating with these monsters

to learn their secrets for moving those massive stones

And as it turns out Cyclops aren't even that strong

They're just really smart about getting material to work for them

Now the videos you see behind me of large stonelike wobbly creatures

are the results of this collaboration

OK so Cyclops might be a mythical creature

but those wonders are still real

People made them

But they also made the myths that surround them

and when it comes to wonders there's this thick connective tissue

between mythology and reality

Take Easter Island for example

When the Dutch explorers first encountered the island

they asked the people of Rapa Nui

how their ancestors could have possibly moved those massive statues

And the Rapa Nui said

Our ancestors didn't move the statues

because the statues walked themselves

For centuries this was dismissed but actually it's true

The statues known as moai were transported standing

pivoting from side to side

OK

As spectacular as the moai are for visitors today

you have to imagine being there then

with colossal moai marching around the island

Because the real memorial was not the objects themselves

it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life

So as an architect I've been chasing that dream

How can we shift our idea of construction to accommodate that mythical side

So what I've been doing is challenging myself

with putting on a series of performances

of the ancient but pretty straightforward task

of just moving and standing big heavy objects

like this foottall megalith designed to walk across land

and stand vertically

or this pound behemoth that springs itself to life

to dance onstage

And what I've found is that by thinking of architecture

not as an end product but as a performance

from conception to completion

we end up rediscovering some really smart ways to build things today

You know so much of the discussion surrounding our future

focuses on technology efficiency and speed

But if I've learned anything from Cyclops

it's that wonders can be smart spectacular

and sustainable 

because of their mass and their mystery

And while people still want to know how those ancient wonders were built

I've been asking Cyclops how to create the mystery

that compels people to ask that very question

Because in an era where we design buildings

to last  maybe  years

I would love to learn how to create something

that could entertain for an eternity

Thank you

Applause

I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world

and what we can now do with them

Proteins

some of which you see inside a cell here

carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies

Proteins digest your food

contract your muscles

fire your neurons

and power your immune system

Everything that happens in biology 

almost 

happens because of proteins

Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids

Nature uses an alphabet of  amino acids

some of which have names you may have heard of

In this picture for scale each bump is an atom

Chemical forces between the amino acids cause these long stringy molecules

to fold up into unique threedimensional structures

The folding process

while it looks random

is in fact very precise

Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time

and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second

And it's the shapes of proteins

which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions

For example

hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited

for binding a molecule of oxygen

When hemoglobin moves to your muscle

the shape changes slightly

and the oxygen comes out

The shapes of proteins

and hence their remarkable functions

are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain

In this picture each letter on top is an amino acid

Where do these sequences come from

The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences

of your proteins

Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein

The translation between these amino acid sequences

and the structures and functions of proteins

is known as the protein folding problem

It's a very hard problem

because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt

Because of this complexity

humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins

by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences

of the proteins we've found in nature

This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancestors used

to make tools and other implements from the sticks and stones

that we found in the world around us

But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds

Laughter

Instead scientists inspired by birds uncovered the principles of aerodynamics

Engineers then used those principles to design custom flying machines

In a similar way

we've been working for a number of years

to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding

and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta
Rosetta
We made a breakthrough in recent years

We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer

Once we've designed the new protein

we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene

We have to make a synthetic gene

because since the protein is completely new

there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it

Our advances in understanding protein folding

and how to design proteins

coupled with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis

and the Moore's law increase in computing power

now enable us to design tens of thousands of new proteins

with new shapes and new functions

on the computer

and encode each one of those in a synthetic gene

Once we have those synthetic genes

we put them into bacteria

to program them to make these brandnew proteins

We then extract the proteins

and determine whether they function as we designed them to

and whether they're safe

It's exciting to be able to make new proteins

because despite the diversity in nature

evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of proteins possible

I told you that nature uses an alphabet of  amino acids

and a typical protein is a chain of about  amino acids

so the total number of possibilities is  times  times   times

which is a number on the order of  to the th power

which is enormously more than the total number of proteins

which have existed since life on earth began

And it's this unimaginably large space

we can now explore using computational protein design

Now the proteins that exist on earth

evolved to solve the problems faced by natural evolution

For example replicating the genome

But we face new challenges today

We live longer so new diseases are important

We're heating up and polluting the planet

so we face a whole host of ecological challenges

If we had a million years to wait

new proteins might evolve to solve those challenges

But we don't have millions of years to wait

Instead with computational protein design

we can design new proteins to address these challenges today

Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age

through technological revolution in protein design

We've already shown that we can design new proteins

with new shapes and functions

For example vaccines work by stimulating your immune system

to make a strong response against a pathogen

To make better vaccines

we've designed protein particles

to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens

like this blue protein here from the respiratory virus RSV
RSV
To make vaccine candidates

that are literally bristling with the viral protein

we find that such vaccine candidates

produce a much stronger immune response to the virus

than any previous vaccines that have been tested

This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes
RSV
of infant mortality worldwide

We've also designed new proteins to break down gluten in your stomach

for celiac disease

and other proteins to stimulate your immune system to fight cancer

These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution

We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution

the digital revolution

which took place in large part due to advances in one place

Bell Laboratories

Bell Labs was a place with an open collaborative environment

and was able to attract top talent from around the world

And this led to a remarkable string of innovations 

the transistor the laser satellite communication

and the foundations of the internet

Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design

We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world

to accelerate the protein design revolution

and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges

First by taking proteins from flu strains from around the world

and putting them on top of the designed protein particles

I showed you earlier

we aim to make a universal flu vaccine

one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu

The ability to design 

Applause

The ability to design new vaccines on the computer

is important both to protect against natural flu epidemics

and in addition intentional acts of bioterrorism

Second we're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet

of just  amino acids

to design new therapeutic candidates for conditions such as chronic pain

using an alphabet of thousands of amino acids

Third we're building advanced delivery vehicles

to target existing medications exactly where they need to go in the body

For example chemotherapy to a tumor

or gene therapies to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place

Fourth we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body

and go far beyond current medicines

which are really blunt instruments

For example to target a small subset of immune cells

responsible for an autoimmune disorder

and distinguish them from the vast majority of healthy immune cells

Finally inspired by remarkable biological materials

such as silk abalone shell tooth and others

we're designing new proteinbased materials

to address challenges in energy and ecological issues

To do all this we're growing our institute

We seek to attract energetic talented and diverse scientists

from around the world at all career stages

to join us

You can also participate in the protein design revolution

through our online folding and design game Foldit
Foldit
And through our distributed computing project Rosettahome
Rosettahome
which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone

Making the world a better place through protein design is my life's work

I'm so excited about what we can do together

I hope you'll join us

and thank you

Applause and cheers

There is some medical news that nobody absolutely nobody

is prepared to hear

I certainly wasn't

It was three years ago that I got a call in my office

with the test results of a recent scan

I was  and finally living the life I wanted

I married my high school sweetheart

and had finally gotten pregnant after years of infertility

And then suddenly we had a Zach

a perfect oneyearold boydinosaur

depending on his mood

And having a Zach suited me perfectly

I had gotten the first job I applied for in academia

land of a thousand crushed dreams

And there I was

working at my dream job

with my little baby

and the man I had imported from Canada

Laughter

But a few months before I'd started feeling pain in my stomach

and had gone to every expert to find out why

No one could tell me

And then out of the blue

some physician's assistant called me at work

to tell me that I had stage IV cancer

and that I was going to need to come to the hospital right away

And all I could think of to say was

But I have a son

I can't end

This world can't end

It has just begun

And then I called my husband and he rushed to find me

and I said all the true things that I have known

I said I have loved you forever

I have loved you forever

I am so sorry

Please take care of our son

And then as I began the walk to the hospital

it crossed my mind for the first time

Oh How ironic

I had just written a book called Blessed

Laughter

I am a historian

and an expert in the idea that good things happen to good people

I research a form of Christianity nicknamed the prosperity gospel

for its very bold promise that God wants you to prosper

I never considered myself a follower of the prosperity gospel

I was simply an observer

The prosperity gospel believes that God wants to reward you

if you have the right kind of faith

If you're good and faithful

God will give you health and wealth

and boundless happiness

Life is like a boomerang

if you're good

good things will always come back to you

Think positively Speak positively

Nothing is impossible if you believe

I got interested in this very American theology

when I was  or so

and by  I was traveling the country interviewing its celebrities

I spent a decade talking to televangelists

with spiritual guarantees for divine money

I interviewed countless megachurch pastors with spectacular hair

about how they live their best lives now

I visited with people in hospital waiting rooms

and plush offices

I held hands with people in wheelchairs

praying to be cured

I earned my reputation as destroyer of family vacations

for always insisting on being dropped off at the fanciest megachurch in town

If there was a river running through the sanctuary

an eagle flying freely in the auditorium

or an enormous spinning golden globe

I was there

When I first started studying this the whole idea of being blessed

wasn't what it is today

It was not like it is now

an entire line of blessed home goods

It was not yet a flood of blessed vanity license plates and Tshirts
T
and neon wall art

I had no idea that blessed would become one of the most common cultural cliches

one of the most used hashtags on Instagram
Instagram
to celebrate barely there bikini shots

as if to say I am so blessed

Thank you Jesus for this body

Laughter

I had not yet fully grasped the way that the prosperity gospel

had become the great civil religion

offering another transcendent account

of the core of the American Dream

Rather than worshipping the founding of America itself

the prosperity gospel worshipped Americans

It deifies and ritualizes their hungers

their hard work and moral fiber

Americans believe in a gospel of optimism

and they are their own proof

But despite telling myself

I'm just studying this stuff I'm nothing like them

when I got my diagnosis

I suddenly understood how deeply invested I was

in my own Horatio Alger theology

If you live in this culture whether you are religious or not

it is extremely difficult to avoid falling into the trap

of believing that virtue and success go hand in hand

The more I stared down my diagnosis

the more I recognized that I had my own quiet version

of the idea that good things happen to good people

Aren't I good

Aren't I special somehow

I have committed zero homicides

to date

Laughter

Applause

So why is this happening to me

I wanted God to make me good

and to reward my faith with just a few shining awards along the way

OK like a lot of shining awards

Laughter

I believed that hardships were only detours

on what I was certain would be my long long life

As is this case with many of us it's a mindset that served me well

The gospel of success drove me to achieve

to dream big

to abandon fear

It was a mindset that served me well

until it didn't

until I was confronted with something I couldn't manage my way out of

until I found myself saying into the phone

But I have a son

because it was all I could think of to say

That was the most difficult moment to accept

the phone call the walk to the hospital

when I realized that my own personal prosperity gospel

had failed me

Anything I thought was good or special about me could not save me 

my hard work my personality

my humor my perspective

I had to face the fact that my life is built with paper walls

and so is everyone else's

It is a hard thought to accept that we are all a breath away

from a problem that could destroy something irreplaceable

or alter our lives completely

We know that in life there are befores and afters

I am asked all the time to say that I would never go back

or that I've gained so much in perspective

And I tell them no

before was better

A few months after I got sick I wrote about this

and then I sent it off to an editor at the New York Times

In retrospect taking one of the most vulnerable moments of your life

and turning into an oped

is not an amazing way to feel less vulnerable

Laughter

I got thousands of letters and emails

I still get them every day

I think it is because of the questions I asked

I asked How do you live without quite so many reasons

for the bad things that happen

I asked Would it be better to live without outrageous formulas

for why people deserve what they get

And what was so funny and so terrible was of course

I thought I asked people to simmer down

on needing an explanation for the bad things that happened

So what did thousands of readers do

Yeah they wrote to defend the idea that there had to be a reason

for what happened to me

And they really want me to understand the reason

People want me to reassure them that my cancer is all part of a plan

A few letters even suggested it was God's plan that I get cancer

so I could help people by writing about it

People are certain it is a test of my character

or proof of something terrible I've done

They want me to know without a doubt

that there is a hidden logic to this seeming chaos

They tell my husband

while I'm still in the hospital

that everything happens for a reason

and then stammer awkwardly when he says

I'd love to hear it

I'd love to hear the reason my wife is dying

And I get it

We all want reasons

We want formulas

to predict whether our hard work will pay off

whether our love and support will always make our partners happy

and our kids love us

We want to live in a world in which not one ounce

of our hard work or our pain or our deepest hopes will be for nothing

We want to live in a world in which nothing is lost

But what I have learned in living with stage IV cancer
IV
is that there is no easy correlation

between how hard I try

and the length of my life

In the last three years I've experienced more pain and trauma

than I ever thought I could survive

I realized the other day that I've had so many abdominal surgeries

that I'm on my fifth belly button

and this last one is my least favorite

Laughter

But at the same time I've experienced love

so much love

love I find hard to explain

The other day I was reading the findings

of the Near Death Experience Research Foundation

and yes there is such a thing

People were interviewed about their brushes with death

in all kinds of circumstances

car accidents labor and delivery

suicides

And many reported the same odd thing

love

I'm sure I would have ignored it if it hadn't reminded me

of something I had experienced

something I felt uncomfortable telling anyone

that when I was sure that I was going to die

I didn't feel angry

I felt loved

It was one of the most surreal things I have experienced

In a time in which I should have felt abandoned by God

I was not reduced to ashes

I felt like I was floating

floating on the love and prayers

of all those who hummed around me like worker bees

bringing me notes and socks and flowers

and quilts embroidered with words of encouragement

But when they sat beside me

my hand in their hands

my own suffering began to feel like it had revealed to me

the suffering of others

I was entering a world of people just like me

people stumbling around in the debris

of dreams they thought they were entitled to

and plans they didn't realize they had made

It was a feeling of being more connected somehow with other people

experiencing the same situation

And that feeling stayed with me for months

In fact I'd grown so accustomed to it

that I started to panic at the prospect of losing it

So I began to ask friends theologians historians nuns I liked

What I am I going to do when that loving feeling is gone

And they knew exactly what I was talking about

because they had either experienced it themselves

or they'd read about it in great works of Christian theology

And they said

Yeah it'll go

The feelings will go

And there will be no formula for how to get it back

But they offered me this little piece of reassurance

and I clung to it

They said

When the feelings recede like the tides

they will leave an imprint

And they do

And it is not proof of anything

and it is nothing to boast about

It was just a gift

So I can't respond to the thousands of emails I get

with my own fivestep plan to divine health

and magical floating feelings

I see that the world is jolted by events that are wonderful and terrible

gorgeous and tragic

I can't reconcile the contradiction

except that I am beginning to believe that these opposites

do not cancel each other out

Life is so beautiful

and life is so hard

Today I am doing quite well

The immunotherapy drugs appear to be working

and we are watching and waiting with scans

I hope I will live a long time

I hope I will live long enough to embarrass my son

and to watch my husband lose his beautiful hair

And I think I might

But I am learning to live

and to love

without counting the cost

without reasons and assurances that nothing will be lost

Life will break your heart

and life may take everything you have

and everything you hope for

But there is one kind of prosperity gospel that I believe in

I believe that in the darkness

even there

there will be beauty

and there will be love

And every now and then

it will feel like more than enough

Thank you

Applause

My mom has always reminded me

that I have the same proportions as a LEGO man

Laughter

And she does actually have a point

LEGO is a company that has succeeded

in making everybody believe that LEGO is from their home country

But it's not it's from my home country

So you can imagine my excitement when the LEGO family called me

and asked us to work with them to design the Home of the Brick

This is the architectural model  we built it out of LEGO obviously
LEGO
This is the final result

And what we tried to do was to design

a building that would be as interactive and as engaging and as playful

as LEGO is itself

with these kind of interconnected playgrounds on the roofscape

You can enter a square on the ground

where the citizens of Billund can roam around freely without a ticket

And it's probably one of the only museums in the world

where you're allowed to touch all the artifacts

But the Danish word for design is formgivning which literally means

to give form to that which has not yet been given form

In other words to give form to the future

And what I love about LEGO is that LEGO is not a toy

It's a tool that empowers the child to build his or her own world

and then to inhabit that world through play

and to invite her friends to join her in cohabiting and cocreating that world

And that is exactly what formgivning is

As human beings we have the power to give form to our future

Inspired by LEGO

we've built a social housing project in Copenhagen

where we stacked blocks of wood next to each other

Between them they leave spaces with extra ceiling heights and balconies

And by gently wiggling the blocks

we can actually create curves or any organic form

adapting to any urban context

Because adaptability is probably one of the strongest drivers of architecture

Another example is here in Vancouver

We were asked to look at the site where Granville bridge triforks

as it touches downtown

And we started like mapping the different constraints

There's like a foot setback from the bridge

because the city want to make sure

that no one looks into the traffic on the bridge

There's a park where we can't cast any shadows

So finally we're left with a tiny triangular footprint

almost too small to build

But then we thought like

what if the foot minimum distance is really about minimum distance 

once we get  feet up in the air we can grow the building back out

And so we did

When you drive over the bridge

it's as if someone is pulling a curtain aback

welcoming you to Vancouver

Or a like a weed growing through the cracks in the pavement

and blossoming as it gets light and air

Underneath the bridge we've worked with Rodney Graham

and a handful of Vancouver artists

to create what we called the Sistine Chapel of street art

an art gallery turned upside down

that tries to turn the negative impact of the bridge into a positive

So even if it looks like this kind of surreal architecture

it's highly adapted to its surroundings

So if a bridge can become a museum a museum can also serve as a bridge

In Norway we are building a museum that spans across a river

and allows people to sort of journey through the exhibitions

as they cross from one side of a sculpture park to the other

An architecture sort of adapted to its landscape

In China we built a headquarters for an energy company

and we designed the facade like an Issey Miyake fabric

It's rippled so that facing the predominant direction of the sun

it's all opaque

facing away from the sun it's all glass

On average it sort of transitions from solid to clear

And this very simple idea without any moving parts

or any sort of technology

purely because of the geometry of the facade

reduces the energy consumption on cooling by  percent

So you can say what makes the building look elegant

is also what makes it perform elegantly

It's an architecture that is adapted to its climate

You can also adapt one culture to another

like in Manhattan we took the Copenhagen courtyard building

with a social space where people can hang out

in this kind of oasis in the middle of a city

and we combined it with the density and the verticality

of an American skyscraper

creating what we've called a courtscraper
courtrapper
From New York to Copenhagen

On the waterfront of Copenhagen

we are right now finishing this wastetoenergy power plant

It's going to be the cleanest wastetoenergy power plant in the world

there are no toxins coming out of the chimney

An amazing marvel of engineering that is completely invisible

So we thought how can we express this

And in Copenhagen we have snow as you can see

but we have absolutely no mountains

We have to go six hours by bus to get to Sweden

to get alpine skiing

So we thought let's put an alpine ski slope

on the roof of the power plant

So this is the first test run we did a few months ago

And what I like about this

is that it also show you the sort of worldchanging power of formgivning

I have a fivemonthold son

and he's going to grow up in a world

not knowing that there was ever a time

when you couldn't ski on the roof of the power plant

Laughter

Applause

So imagine for him and his generation that's their baseline

Imagine how far they can leap

what kind of wild ideas they can put forward for their future

So right in front of it we're building our smallest project

It's basically nine containers

that we have stacked in a shipyard in Poland

then we've schlepped it across the Baltic sea

and docked it in the port of Copenhagen

where it is now the home of  students

Each student has a view to the water

they can jump out the window into the clean port of Copenhagen

and they can get back in

All of the heat comes from the thermal mass of the sea

all the power comes from the sun

This is the first  units in Copenhagen

another  on their way

another  are going to Gothenburg

and we're speaking with the Paris Olympics

to put a small floating village on the Seine

So very much this kind of almost like nomadic impermanent architecture

And the waterfronts of our cities are experiencing a lot of change

Economic change industrial change and climate change

This is Manhattan before Hurricane Sandy

and this is Manhattan after Sandy

We got invited by the city of New York

to look if we could make the necessary flood protection for Manhattan

without building a seawall

that would segregate the life of the city from the water around it

And we got inspired by the High Line

You probably know the High Line  it's this amazing new park in New York

It's basically decommissioned train tracks

that now have become one of the most popular promenades in the city

So we thought

could we design the necessary flood protection for Manhattan

so we don't have to wait until we shut it down before it gets nice

So we sat down with the citizens living along the waterfront of New York

and we worked with them to try to design the necessary flood protection

in such a way that it only makes their waterfront

more accessible and more enjoyable

Underneath the FDR we are putting like pavilions

with pocket walls that can slide out and protect from the water

We are creating little stepped terraces

that are going to make the underside more enjoyable

but also protect from flooding

Further north in the East River Park

we are creating rolling hills

that protect the park from the noise of the highway

but in turn also become the necessary flood protection

that can stop the waves during an incoming storm surge

So in a way this project that we have called the Dryline

it's essentially the High Line 

Laughter

The High Line that's going to keep Manhattan dry

Applause

It's scheduled to break ground on the first East River portion

at the end of this year

But it has essentially been codesigned

with the citizens of Lower Manhattan

to take all of the necessary infrastructure for resilience

and give it positive social and environmental side effects

So New York is not alone in facing this situation

In fact by 

 percent of the major cities in the world

are going to be dealing with rising seas

In Hamburg

they've created a whole neighborhood

where the bottom floors are designed to withstand the inevitable flood

In Sweden they've designed a city where all of the parks are wet gardens

designed to deal with storm water and waste water

So we thought could we perhaps 

Actually today

three million people are already permanently living on the sea

So we thought could we actually imagine a floating city

designed to incorporate all of the Sustainable Development Goals

of the United Nations

into a whole new humanmade ecosystem

And of course we have to design it so it can produce its own power

harvesting the thermal mass of the oceans

the force of the tides of the currents of the waves

the power of the wind

the heat and the energy of the sun

Also we are going to collect all of the rain water that drops

on this manmade archipelago

and deal with it organically and mechanically

and store it and clean it

We have to grow all of our food locally

it has to be fish and plantbased

because you won't have the space or the resources for a dairy diet

And finally

we are going to deal with all the waste locally

with compost recycling and turning the waste into energy

So imagine where a traditional urban master plan

you typically draw the street grid where the cars can drive

and the building plots where you can put some buildings

This master plan we sat down with a handful of scientists

and basically started with all of the renewable

available natural resources

and then we started channeling the flow of resources

through this kind of humanmade ecosystem or this kind of urban metabolism

So it's going to be modular

it's going to be buoyant

it's going to be designed to resist a tropical storm

You can prefabricate it at scale

and tow it to dock with others to form a small community

We're designing these kind of coastal additions

so that even if it's modular and rational

each island can be unique with its own coastal landscape

The architecture has to remain relatively low

to keep the center of gravity buoyant

We're going to take all of the agriculture

and use it to also create social space

so you can actually enjoy the permaculture gardens

We're designing it for the tropics so all of the roofs are maximized

to harvest solar power and to shade from the sun

All the materials are going to be light and renewable

like bamboo and wood

which is also going to create this charming warm environment

And any architecture is supposed to be able to fit on this platform

Underneath we have all the storage inside the pontoon

almost like a mega version of the student housings

that we've already worked with

We have all the storage for the energy that's produced

all of the water storage and remediation

We are sort of dealing with all of the waste and the composting

And we also have some backup farming

with aeroponics and hydroponics

So imagine almost like a vertical section through this landscape

that goes from the air above where we have vertical farms

below we have the aeroponics and the aquaponics

Even further below we have the ocean farms

and where we tie the island to the ground

we're using biorock to create new reefs to regenerate habitat

So think of this small island for  people

It can then group together to form a cluster or a neighborhood

that then can sort of group together to form an entire city for  people

And you can imagine if this floating city flourishes

it can sort of grow like a culture in a petri dish

So one of the first places we are looking at placing this

or anchoring this floating city

is in the Pearl River delta

So imagine this kind of canopy of photovoltaics

on this archipelago floating in the sea

As you sail towards the island you will see the maritime residents

moving around on alternative forms of aquatic transportation

You come into this kind of community port

You can roam around in the permaculture gardens
permaculture
that are productive landscapes but also social landscapes

The greenhouses also become orangeries for the cultural life of the city

and below under the sea

it's teeming with life of farming and science

and social spaces

So in a way you can imagine this community port

is where people gather both by day and by night

And even if the first one is designed for the tropics

we also imagine that the architecture can adapt to any culture

so imagine like a Middle Eastern floating city

or Southeast Asian floating city

or maybe a Scandinavian floating city one day

So maybe just to conclude

The human body is  percent water

And the surface of our planet is  percent water

And it's rising

And even if the whole world woke up tomorrow

and became carbonneutral over night

there are still island nations that are destined to sink in the seas

unless we also develop alternate forms of floating human habitats

And the only constant in the universe is change

Our world is always changing and right now our climate is changing

No matter how critical the crisis is and it is

this is also our collective human superpower

That we have the power to adapt to change

and we have the power to give form to our future

Applause

I'd like to tell you today about an orca named Tahlequah
Tahlequah
Tahlequah is also known as J to scientists
TahlequahJ
because she swims with the J Pod in the Salish Sea
J Pod
These are the waters off of British Columbia and Washington State

Now last year in July 

she was well along in her month pregnancy

and scientists were very excited

because no baby had survived in this pod for three long years

Now orcas are also known as killer whales

They're profoundly social and profoundly intelligent beings

And scientists are very interested in their behavior

because in their social networks they share habits information

and even affection

They create true cultures of the ocean

But this pod has been in trouble

The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor has been way down in the region

and pollution has been up

But on July th Tahlequah gave birth to a daughter
Tahlequah
and scientists were so excited by this development

But unfortunately the same day  in fact shortly after birth 

the calf died

Well what happened next electrified animal lovers

across the world

because Tahlequah refused to let her baby slip off into the water
Tahlequah
She kept it on her body and she swam with it

If it did fall off she would dive and rescue it

and she battled stiff currents to do this

Now she kept this behavior up

for  days

and during this time she swam over  miles

At that point she let the little baby slip off into the water

So today Tahlequah swims on with the J Pod
TahlequahJ Pod
but her grief still moves me

And I do believe that grief is the right word to use

I believe that grief is the right word to use

for numerous animals who mourn the dead

They may be friends or mates or relatives

Because these visible cues these behavioral cues

tell us something about an animal's emotional state

Now for the last seven years

I've been working to document examples of animal grief 

in birds in mammals

in domesticated animals and in wild animals 

and I believe in the reality of animal grief

Now I say it this way

because I need to acknowledge to you right up front

that not all scientists agree with me

And part of the reason I think

is because of what I call the aword
aword
The aword is anthropomorphism

and historically it's been a big deterrent

to recognizing animal emotions

So anthropomorphism is when we project onto other animals

our capacities or our emotions

And we can all probably think of examples of this

Let's say we have a friend who tells us

My cat understands everything I say

Or My dog he's so sweet

he ran right across the yard this morning towards a squirrel

and I know he just wants to play

Well maybe

Or maybe not

I'm skeptical about claims like those

But animal grief is different

because we're not trying to read an animal's mind

We're looking at visible cues of behavior

and trying to interpret them with some meaning

Now it's true  scientists often push back at me

and they'll say

Ah look the animal might be stressed

or maybe the animal's just confused

because his or her routine has been disrupted

But I think that this overworry about anthropomorphism

misses a fundamental point

And that is that animals can care very deeply for each other

maybe they even love each other

And when they do

a survivor's heart can be pierced by a death

Let's face it

if we deny evolutionary continuity

we are really missing out on embracing part of ourselves

So yes I believe in the reality of animal grief

and I also think that if we recognize it

we can make the world a better place for animals

a kinder place for animals

So let me tell you a little bit more about animal grief

I'm going to start in Kenya

You see here there's an elephant named Eleanor

who came one day with bruised legs

and she collapsed

You see on the left

that another female named Grace came to her right away

and using her own trunk propped her up

tried to get her up on her feet

And she did succeed

but then Eleanor collapsed again

At this point Grace became visibly distressed

and she prodded the body and she vocalized

Eleanor collapsed again

and unfortunately she did die

What you see on the right is a female from another family named Maui

who came after the death and she stayed at the body

She held a vigil there and she even rocked in distress

over the body

So the scientists watching the elephants

kept close observation on Eleanor's body

for seven days

And during those seven days

a parade of elephants came

from five different families

Now some were just curious

but others carried out behaviors

that I really believe should be classified as grief

So what does grief look like

It can be rocking as I said in distress

It can also be social withdrawal

when an animal just takes himself or herself away from friends

and stays by themselves

or a failure to eat or sleep properly

sometimes a depressed posture or vocalization

It can be very helpful for those of us studying this

to be able to compare the behavior of a survivor before death

and after death

because that increases the rigor of our interpretation

And I can explain this to you

by talking about two ducks named Harper and Kohl

So we're into birds now

So Harper and Kohl were raised at a foie gras factory

and they were treated cruelly

Foie gras does involve forcefeeding of birds

So this hurt their bodies and their spirits were not in good shape either

But thankfully they were rescued by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York

And for four years they stabilized and they were fast friends

They often took themselves to a small pond on the property

Then Kohl started to have really intractable pain in his legs

and it was clear to the sanctuary that he had to be euthanized humanely

and he was

But then the sanctuary workers did a brilliant thing

because they brought Harper to the body to see

And at first Harper prodded the body of his friend

but then he laid himself over it

and he stayed there for over an hour with his friend

And in the weeks after

he had a hard time

He would go back to that same pond where he had been with Kohl

and he didn't want any other friends

And within two months he died as well

Now I'm happy to say

that not all grieving animals have this sorrowful outcome

Last summer I flew to Boston to visit my adult daughter Sarah

I was with my husband Charlie

I really needed a break from work

But I succumbed and I checked my work email

You know how that is

And there was a communication about a dejected donkey

Now as an anthropologist this wasn't what I expected

but there it was and I'm glad I read it

Because a donkey named Lena had gone to another farm sanctuary

this one in Alberta Canada

as the only donkey there

and had trouble making friends for that reason

But she eventually did make friends with an older horse named Jake

and for three years they were inseparable

But the reason the email came was that Jake at age  the horse

had become gravely ill and had to be put down

and this is what was going on

This is Lena standing on Jake's grave

She didn't want to come in at night She didn't want to come in for food

She didn't want to come in for water

She pawed at the grave she brayed in distress

and there she stood

So we talked and we brainstormed

What do you do for an animal like this

And we talked about the role of time

of extra love and kindness from people

and of urging her to make a new friend

And here's where her trajectory does diverge from that of Harper the duck

because she did make a new friend

and sanctuary workers wrote back and said it worked out well

Now sometimes scientists supplement observation

with hormonal analysis

There's an example of a group of scientists in Botswana

who took fecal material from baboons and compared two different groups

The first group were females who had witnessed a predator attack

and lost someone in that attack

and the second group were females who had witnessed an attack

but had not lost someone

And the stress hormones were way up in that first group

But here's the thing

the scientists didn't just call them stressed baboons

they called them bereaved baboons

and in part that's because of the observations that they made

For example this motherdaughter pair were very close

and then the daughter was killed by a lion

The mother removed herself from all her friends

from her grooming networks and just stayed by herself for weeks 

bereavement 

and she then slowly recovered

So we have bereaved baboons

Will science tell us someday about bereaved bees

Will we hear about frogs who mourn

I don't think so and I think the reason is because animals really need

onetoone close relationships for that to happen

I also know that circumstance matters and personality matters

I have documented cats and dogs who grieve

our companion animals

but I also interacted with a woman who was extremely bothered

because her dog wasn't grieving

She said to me The first dog in the house has died

The second animal does not seem concerned the second dog

What is wrong with him

Laughter

And as I listened to her

I realized that this dog was now the only animal in the household

and as far as he was concerned that was a pretty good deal

So circumstances matter

Now in any case animals are not going to grieve

exactly like we do

We have human creativity

We paint our grief dance our grief

write our grief

We also can grieve for people we've never met

across space and time

I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin

and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial

Animals don't grieve exactly like we do

but this doesn't mean that their grief isn't real

It is real and it's searing

and we can see it if we choose

Now I've lost both my parents

I lost a very dear friend at a young age from AIDS

I believe most likely most of you here have lost someone

And I have found it a genuine comfort

a solace to know that we aren't the only beings on this earth

who feel love and grief

And I think this is important

I also think we can take this a step further

and we can realize that the reality of animal grief

can help us be better and do better for animals

This is already happening with Tahlequah
Tahlequah
because the United States and Canada have renewed their talks with greater urgency

for how to help the orcas

how to restore the Chinook salmon

and how to help with the water pollution

We can also see that if grief is real

there's tremendous plausibility to the notion

that animals feel a whole range of things

So we could look at joy sadness even hope

And if we do that

here's how we can start to think about the world

We can look at orcas and say

we know they grieve we know they feel their lives

and we can refuse to confine them to small tanks in theme parks

and make them perform for our entertainment

Applause

Thank you

We can look at elephants and say yes they grieve

and we can renew our efforts against international trophy hunting

and against poaching

Applause

Thank you

And we can look at our closest living relatives monkeys and apes

and know yes they grieve they feel their lives

so they don't deserve to be confined

in highly invasive biomedical experiments

year after year

And you know 

Applause

the ducks Harper and Kohl they tell us something too

They help us connect the dots and realize that what we eat

affects how animals live

And it's not just foie gras and it's not just ducks

We can think about pigs and chickens and cows in factory farms

and we can know

I can tell you the science is real that these animals feel too

So every single time we choose a plantbased meal

we are contributing to reducing animal suffering

Applause

So yes I believe in the reality of animal grief

I believe in the reality of animal love

and I think it is time for us humans

to recognize that we don't own these things

And when we see that

we have an opportunity to make the world so much better for animals

a kinder world a gentler world

and along the way we might just save ourselves too

Thank you so much

Applause

Thank you Thank you

In  in July

three Americans launched into space

Now they went to the surface of the moon

they famously made the great leap for mankind

Buzz Aldrin Neil Armstrong they walked on the surface

they planted this flag

It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph

We think it was this amazing accomplishment

They didn't just leave behind this flag though

They also left behind a plaque

This plaque is a beautiful object

and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about

First you might notice that there's two globes

representing all of earth

And then there's this beautiful statement

We came in peace for all mankind

Now at first this is just nice poetic language

but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment

It seems industrial it seems engineered

It also is the best possible name

you could come up with for something on the moon Futura

Now I want to talk to you about fonts

and why this typeface is perfect for this moment

But it's actually more than just ceremonial

Now when all of you arrived here today

you actually had to think about fonts

You might not realize it

but you're all unconscious experts on typography

Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world

they're the visual language of the words we use

Here's the thing that's funny about this though

I know you're probably not like me you're not a font nerd

maybe some of you are but if you're not that's alright

because I might spend hours every day

trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project

or I might spend thousands of dollars every year

trying to get ones with the right features

But all of you actually spend hours every day evaluating fonts

If you don't believe me think about how you got here

Each of you had to judge by the signs

and maybe even on your phone

which signals to trust and which to ignore

You were evaluating fonts

Or maybe when you're just buying a new product

you have to think about whether something is expensive

or cheap or hard to get or easy to find

And the funny thing about it is

this may not seem extraordinary to you

but the moment you see something out of place

you recognize it right away

Laughter

The thing I love about typography

and why I love fonts and why I love Futura
Futura
is that for me what I study is everywhere

Every street that I walk down every book that I pick up

every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love

Now once you understand the history and what happens with typography

you actually have a history of everything before you

And this is the typeface Futura
Futura
As previously we've discussed this is modernism in miniature

This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country

and became perhaps the most popular or promiscuous typeface

of the twentieth century

Less is more right these are the aphorisms of modernism

And in the visual arts the same thing happened

Let's focus on the essentials focus on the basic shapes

focus on geometry

So Futura actually holds this to its core
Futura
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura

have circles squares triangles

Some of the shapes are all based on circles

like the O D and C
ODC
or others have this pointed apex of the triangle

Others just look like they might have been made

with a ruler or a compass

They feel geometric they feel mathematic precise

In fact this whole system carries through with the way

that the typeface was designed

To not look like it was made like other typefaces to be something new

Here it is in the lightweight the medium weight and the bold weight

The whole family has different things to commend to it

This was a conscious break from the past

something that looked like it was made by a machine and not by hand

When I say not made by hand this is what I mean

This is what we think about maybe

when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen

That there's thicks and thins

And even more traditional typefaces say like a Garamond
Garamond
holds vestiges of this old system

in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top
A
and thicker down below

because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand

But Futura in contrast

is designed to look like no one had touched it at all

that this was made by a machine

for a machine age for an industrial age

There's actually a sleight of hand here

that Paul Renner the designer who made this in  employed

If you look at the way in which

the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft

you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly

And this is one of hundreds of ways

in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect

even though it's mathematically not

And this is what typeface designers do all the time

to make typefaces work every day

Now there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America

These are a few other excellent examples from Europe

trying to create something new for the new age a new moment in time

These are some other ones in Germany

that in some ways look very similar to Futura
Futura
maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions

Then why did Futura take over the world
Futura
In this case if you can read the titles there

some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue

Erbar Kabel Light BertholdGrotesk ElegantGrotesk
ErbarKabel LightBertholdGroteskElegantGrotesk
These aren't exactly household names are they

And so when you compare that to Futura
Futura
you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team

What's amazing about this name 

you know what's in this name is that this is a name

that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future

And this isn't actually the word for future in German

it wasn't a German name

they actually picked something

that would speak to a wider larger audience a universal audience

And when you compare it to what was being done in America 

these are the typefaces from the same period

in the United States in the s

bold brash braggadocios
Bold brash braggadocios
You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like

when they were all going nuts in the s

And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary
Futura
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use

So this is a magazine that we all probably know today Vanity Fair

This is what it looked like in  in the summer

And in many ways there's nothing wrong with this design

This is absolutely typical of the s

There's a photograph of an important person

in this case Franklin Roosevelt thengovernor of New York

Everything seems centered everything seems symmetrical

There's still a little bit of ornamentation

so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady

and not fully modernistic

But everything seems kid of solid

There's even drop caps to help you get into the text
drop cap
But this all changed very quickly and in October of 

a Berlinbased designer came and redesigned Vanity Fair

And this is what it looks like with Futura

Instead of the governor

now we have a photograph of an abstract beautiful setting

in this case the ocean

Instead of drop caps there's nothing at all

And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry

And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine

In this case even more dramatic asymmetry

In this case illustrations by Pablo Picasso moving across the page

and breaking the gutter of the two pages

And there's something even more radical

If you look closely at the Futura you might notice something

You might not pick it up at first

but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page

You might not think that's very radical

but pick up any magazine any book or go to any website

and I guarantee you are not going to find it very easily

This is still a radical idea

And why is that radical

When we think about what capital letters denote

they denote something important

whether it's our names or our titles

Or maybe even just the name of our corporations

or maybe our trademarks

Actually in some ways America's the home of capitalization

We love putting capitals in everything

Laughter

But think about how radical this would be

to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters

This has maybe had the same political force

that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today

In the s

this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution

And for them this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America

All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian

complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field

Now this is still kind of a radical idea

Think about how often you do capitalize something

to have more power or prestige to it

So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea

Now other designers were doing other things with Futura
Futura
Others brought other ideas of modernism with it

whether it was interesting new illustration styles

or interesting new collage types of illustration

Or even just new book covers

whether they were from Europe

But here's the funny thing

In the s if you wanted to use a new typeface

you couldn't just go download it onto your computer

You actually had to have pieces of lead

So for Americans who wanted to adopt this

and make it part of their own system

something they could use in everyday typography

whether in ads or anything else

they actually had to have metal type

So being good American capitalists what did we do

We made all sorts of copies

Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura

but looked identical to it

whether it was Spartan or Tempo

And in fact by the time that World War II started

American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods

But they said Go ahead and use our copies

Use th Century use Spartan use Vogue use Tempo
VogueTempo
These are identical to Futura
Futura
And in fact for most people they didn't even learn the new names

they just still called it all Futura

So America took this typeface in

conquered it and made it its own

So by the time World War II finishes

Americans are using this on everything

whether it be catalogs or atlases

or encyclopedias or charts and graphs

or calendars or even political material

And even the logo for a new expansion football team

And in fact it was used even on some of the most important advertising

of the th century

So it's in this context

that when the US government was picking a typeface

to use after World War II for new maps and new projects

they picked Futura

It wasn't an astounding choice it wasn't a radical choice

it didn't have anything to do with communism

But in this case it was used on some of the most important maps

so this one an air force map in 

or used for the maps in Vietnam in '

And so it wasn't a surprise

that when astronauts first started the Mercury program

such as John Glenn orbiting the earth

that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura
Futura
And in fact by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo

it started getting used more and more for more things

So in this case for a safety plan

or even starting to get used on instrument panels

or navigational aids

Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked

But here's the amazing thing

it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people

It started to get used for an interface

for an entire system that helped the astronauts

know how to use the machine

NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything
NASA
There was hundreds of contractors 

Boeing IBM McDonnell Douglas 
IBM
all making different machines

Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems

for each component they had in the space shuttles

This would have been impossible to navigate

and there would have been a cognitive overload

every time they had to open up a new system

So in this case Futura being used on the interface
Futura
helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear

And it wasn't just used on buttons it was used on labels

and it was used on their food rations

and it was used on their tool kits

It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do

In fact maybe even some of the places

where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them

instructions were printed entirely in Futura
Futura
so that they could know what to do with that one moment

They didn't have to remember everything in their head

they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to

In this case Futura helped make that system
Futura
which was already a very difficult and complex system

a little less complex

In fact the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen

when they were entering or exiting the spacecraft

would have been in Futura

One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way
Futura
is actually this camera

This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company
Hasselblad
It's a perfectly good camera some of you might have used one

it's prized by photographers as a really great camera

And you might notice if you know anything about cameras

that there's some modifications made to it

In this case there are stickers placed all over the film canisters

or other parts of the camera here

What this enabled NASA to do
NASA
was make something really great out of the astronauts

They're not photographers they're not experts in art

But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camera

because of the labels placed there in Futura

So in this case

Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy

with the things they were using

In this case to not take off the film before it would expose

Which in this case we would have never had

some of the amazing photos we had without this label

When we see something as decorative as this a ceremonial patch

or something like this plaque on the moon

we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial

something more than something that had just been picked for its design

In fact Futura had authority
Futura
had legitimacy and had power because of this choice

There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing

And that is that Futura tells a story

And this is what I love about typefaces is that all of them tell stories

And in this case this typeface tells a very powerful story

about assimilation about something being taken into America

and being made part of its culture

And that's one of the best and worst things America does

is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back again

and claim them our own

And in this case Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technology
Futura
undergirding the whole system

Futura was a German typeface taken in made into an American commodity
Futura
And so were the technologies

the rockets the scientists all came from Germany as well

So in some ways this German typeface on an American plaque

perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology

And in this case

when you think about this story you realize that typography on the moon

represents legitimacy represents authority

and this gave them the astronauts the power to get to the moon

Thank you

Applause

My name is Glenn

I'm 

and I don't know my real last name

It's not uncommon in America

Most black people in this country are walking around

with a slave owner's last name

Black history has been systemically erased and altered for centuries

As I give this talk

there are more than  Confederate monuments standing nationwide

These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers

who fought to maintain slavery 

mostly in the South 

from the s to the s

when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect
Jim Crow
To this day black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders

in our public spaces

These memorials are a physical representation of a system

that is actively working to define whose lives matter

and whose lives do not

If we are going to disrupt the narrative

we have to start at the origin

Genocide slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas

with Christopher Columbus

Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 

Fewer people know that an estimated  indigenous Arawaks were wiped out

within two years of his arrival

Even fewer people know

that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doa Juana de la Torre

that nine and yearold girls were in high demand

and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid

Yet New York City's Columbus Circle has had him perched  feet high

next to Central Park since 

I started Movers and Shakers
Movers and Shakers
a nonprofit

to get the statue removed

Movers and Shakers is a group of activists artists
Movers and Shakers
educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology

to highlight the narratives of the oppressed

In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal

we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism

We created an augmented reality installation

on the true story of Christopher Columbus

and used it to host teachins in Columbus Circle and Times Square

Many see the controversy around the statue

as tension between the ItalianAmerican community

and the indigenous community

The reality is that most black people are here in this country

as a result of the atrocities

that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus

So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square

to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade

I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue

I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment

at their football team's home opener

We gave it everything that we had

but in the end

New York City decided to keep the statue

and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark

The news was devastating

but it opened up another door

We realized that with augmented reality

you don't need permission from the government

to put up a monument or to make a statement

You can just do it

So New York City right now

currently has more than  statues of men and six of women

and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well

So we decided why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments
AR
of women and people of color throughout the city

Typically monuments are created

to commemorate the achievements of the deceased

but with augmented reality we can reroute the rules

We started with sports

Colin Kaepernick

He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco ers

and he wanted to use his platform

to highlight the injustice of systemic racism

So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this

and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem

He lost his contract with the ers

he was blackballed by every NFL owner

he was criticized by millions

and even the president of the United States

decided to insult him

It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage

so our team decided to do this

Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee
Colin Kaepernick
in augmented reality

and there's nothing they can do about it

Laughter

Representation matters

Serena Williams proved to the world

that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport

that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs

Let's celebrate her now

Jackie Robinson

He broke the color barrier

and empowered many black athletes to play in Major League Baseball

We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field

so that anyone can see him swing for the fences

in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn
Ebbets Field
With augmented reality

we have the power to tell stories in public spaces that need to be told

The achievements of people like Frida Kahlo Audre Lorde

Toussaint Louverture

Madam CJ Walker 
CJ
this should be common knowledge

Our vision is a Pokmon Go for a contextualized history

Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations

that are fighting against systemic oppression

In  we will release our free smartphone app

with augmented reality monuments and content

You can take your smartphone and hold it over any onedollar bill

and see a scene in augmented reality

that illustrates the injustice of cash bail

You can then click on the screen

and be directed to the donation page of The Bail Project

a fund that raises money for people who cannot afford bail

With augmented reality

we the people have the power

to highlight the narratives of the oppressed

when institutions refuse to do so

We can use this tool to highlight the systemic implications

of erasing someone's history

And more concretely

we can use this technology as a way to support initiatives

that are fighting against systemic racism

With AR we have the power to reimagine a world
AR
that prioritizes justice over oppression

Thank you

Applause and cheers

I was eight years old

I remember that day clearly

like it happened just yesterday

My mother is a bidi roller
bidi
She handrolls country cigarettes to sustain our family

She is a hard worker

and spent  to  hours every day rolling bidis

That particular day she came home and showed me her bidirolling wage book

She asked me how much money she has earned that week

I went through that book

and what caught my eyes were her thumbprints on each page

My mother has never been to school

She uses her thumbprints instead of a signature

to keep a record of her earnings

On that day for some reason

I wanted to teach her how to hold a pen and write her name

She was reluctant at first

She smiled innocently and said no

But deep down I was sure she wanted to give it a try

With a little bit of perseverance and a lot of effort

we managed to write her name

Her hands were trembling and her face was beaming with pride

As I watched her do this

for the first time in my life

I had a priceless feeling

that I could be of some use to this world

That feeling was very special

because I am not meant to be useful

In rural India girls are generally considered worthless

They're a liability or a burden

If they are considered useful

it is only to cook dishes keep the house clean

or raise children

As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family

I was fairly clear from a very early age

that no one expected anything from me

I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me 

poor village girl 

meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice

These three identities forced me to think

that I should never have been born

Yet I was

All throughout my childhood as I rolled bidis alongside my mother

I would wonder

What did my future hold

I often asked my mother with a lot of anxiety

Amma will my life be different from yours

Will I have a chance to choose my life

Will I go to college

And she would reply back

Try to finish high school first

I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me

She only wanted me to understand

that my dreams might be too big for a girl in my village

When I was  I found the autobiography of Helen Keller

Helen became my inspiration

I admired her indomitable spirit

I wanted to have a college degree like her

so I fought with my father and my relatives to be sent to college

and it worked

During my final year of my undergraduate degree

I desperately wanted to escape from being forced into marriage

so I applied to a fellowship program in Delhi

which is about  miles away from my village

Laughter

In fact I recall that the only way I could fill out the application

was during my commute to college

I did not have access to computers

so I had to borrow a college junior's cell phone

As a woman I could not be seen with a cell phone

so I used to huddle his phone under my shawl

and type as slowly as possible

to ensure that I would not be heard

After many rounds of interviews

I got into the fellowship program with a full scholarship

My father was confused my mother was worried 

Applause

My father was confused my mother was worried

but I felt butterflies in my stomach

because I was going to step out of my village

for the first time

to study in the national capital

Of the  fellows selected that year

I was the only rural college graduate

There was no one there who looked like me or spoke like me

I felt alienated intimidated and judged by many

One fellow called me Coconut Girl

Can you guess why

Anyone

That's because I applied a lot of coconut oil to my hair

Laughter

Another asked me where I had learned to speak English

and some of my peers did not prefer to have me on their assignment teams

because they thought I would not be able to contribute to their discussion

I felt that many of my peers believed that a person from rural India

could not supply anything of value

yet the majority of Indian population today is rural

I realized that stories like mine were considered to be an exception

and never the expectation

I believe that all of us are born into a reality that we blindly accept

until something awakens us and a new world opens up

When I saw my mother's first signature on her bidirolling wage book

when I felt the hot Delhi air against my face

after a hour train journey

when I finally felt free and let myself be

I saw a glimpse of that new world I longed for

a world where a girl like me is no longer a liability or a burden

but a person of use a person of value

and a person of worthiness

By the time my fellowship ended my life had changed

Not only had I traced my lost voice

but also had a choice to make myself useful

I was 

I came back to my village to set up the Bodhi Tree Foundation

an institution that supports rural youth

by providing them with education life skills and opportunities

We work closely with our rural youth

to change their life and to benefit our communities

How do I know my institution is working

Well six months ago we had a new joinee

Her name is Kaviarasi

I first spotted her in a local college in Tirunelveli

during one of my training sessions

As you can see she has a smile which you can never forget

We guided her to get an opportunity to study at Ashoka University Delhi

The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer

working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her

Kaviarasi doesn't want to feel like an exception
Kaviarasi
She wants to be of use to others in this world

Recently Kaviarasi mentored Anitha
KaviarasiAnitha
who also comes from a remote rural village

lives in a footbyfoot home

her parents are also farm laborers

Kaviarasi helped Anitha secure admission in a prestigious undergraduate program
KaviarasiAnitha
in a top university in India with a full scholarship

When Anitha's parents were reluctant to send her that far

we asked the district administration officials

to speak to Anitha's parents

and it worked

And then there is Padma

Padma and I went to college together

She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation

She had been working with me at Bodhi Tree

until one day she decides to go to graduate school

I asked her why

She told me that she wanted to make sure

that she would never be a liability or a burden to anyone

at any point in her life

Padma Anitha and Kaviarasi
PadmaAnithaKaviarasi
grew up in the most tough families and communities

one could only imagine

Yet the journey of finding my usefulness in this world

served them in finding their usefulness to this world

Of course there are challenges

I'm aware change does not happen overnight

A lot of my work involves working with families and communities

to help them understand why getting an education

is useful for everyone

The quickest way to convince them is by doing

When they see their kids getting a real education

getting a real job they begin to change

The best example is what happened at my home

I was recently given an award in recognition of my social work

by the chief minister of my state

That meant I was going to be on television

Laughter

Everyone was hooked on to the television that morning including my parents

I would like to believe that seeing her daughter on television

made my mother feel useful too

Hopefully she will stop pressuring me to get married now

Laughter

Finding my use has helped me to break free from the identities

society thrusts on me 

poor village girl

Finding my use has helped me to break free from being boxed

caged and bottled

Finding my use has helped me to find my voice

my selfworth and my freedom

I leave you with this thought

Where do you feel useful to this world

Because the answer to that question

is where you will find your voice and your freedom

Thank you

Applause

I'm a storyteller

but I'm also a troublemaker

Laughter

And I have a habit of asking difficult questions

It started when I was  years old

and my mother who was raising six children had no time for them

At  fed up with my increasingly annoying questions

she recommended that I begin writing for the local Englishlanguage newspaper

in Pakistan

to put my questions out to the entire country she said

Laughter

At  I was an undercover investigative journalist

I don't even think my editor knew just how young I was

when I sent in a story that named and shamed

some very powerful people

The men I'd written about wanted to teach me a lesson

They wanted to shame me and my family

They spraypainted my name and my family's name

with unspeakable profanities across our front gate

and around our neighborhood

And they felt that my father who was a strict man of tradition

would stop me

Instead my father stood in front of me and said

If you speak the truth I will stand with you

and so will the world

And then he got 

Applause

And then he got a group of people together and they whitewashed the walls

Laughter

I've always wanted my stories to jolt people

to shake them into having difficult conversations

And I felt that I would be more effective if I did something visual

And so at  I became a documentary filmmaker

turning my camera onto marginalized communities

on the front lines in war zones

eventually returning home to Pakistan

where I wanted to document violence against women

Pakistan is home to  million people

And with its low levels of literacy

film can change the way people perceive issues

An effective storyteller speaks to our emotions

elicits empathy and compassion

and forces us to look at things differently

In my country film had the potential to go beyond cinema

It could change lives

The issues that I've always wanted to raise 

I've always wanted to hold up a mirror to society 

they've been driven by my barometer of anger

And my barometer of anger led me in  to honor killings

Honor killings take place in many parts of the world

where men punish women who transgress rules made by them

women who choose to marry on their own free will

or women who are looking for a divorce

or women who are suspected of having illicit relationships

In the rest of the world honor killings would be known as murder

I always wanted to tell that story from the perspective of a survivor

But women do not live to tell their tale

and instead end up in unmarked graves

So one morning when I was reading the newspaper

and I read that a young woman had miraculously survived

after being shot in the face by her father and her uncle

because she chose to marry a man out of her free will

I knew I had found my storyteller

Saba was determined to send her father and her uncle to jail

but in the days after leaving the hospital

pressure mounted on her to forgive

You see there was a loophole in the law

that allowed for victims to forgive perpetrators

enabling them to avoid jail time

And she was told that she would be ostracized

and her family her inlaws

they would all be shunned from the community

because many felt that her father had been well within his right

given her transgression

She fought on 

for months

But on the final day in court

she gave a statement forgiving them

As filmmakers we were devastated

because this was not the film that we had set out to make

In hindsight had she pressed charges fought the case and won

hers would have been an exception

When such a strong woman is silenced

what chance did other women have

And we began to think about using our film

to change the way people perceived honor killings

to impact the loophole in the law

And then our film was nominated for an Academy Award

and honor killings became headline news

and the prime minister while sending his congratulations

offered to host the first screening of the film at his office

Of course we jumped at the chance

because no prime minister in the history of the country had ever done so

And at the screening

which was carried live on national television

he said something that reverberated throughout the country

There is no honor in honor killings he said

Applause

At the Academy Awards in LA

many of the pundits had written us off

but we felt that in order for the legislative push to continue

we needed that win

And then my name was announced

and I bounded up the steps in flipflops because I didn't expect to be onstage

Laughter

And I accepted the statue telling a billion people watching

that the prime minister of Pakistan had pledged to change the law

because of course that's one way of holding the prime minister accountable

Laughter

And 

Applause

Back home the Oscar win dominated headline news

and more people joined the fray

asking for the loophole in the law to be closed

And then in October  after months of campaigning

the loophole was indeed closed

Applause

And now men who kill women in the name of honor

receive life imprisonment

Applause

Yet the very next day

a woman was killed in the name of honor

and then another and another

We had impacted legislation

but that wasn't enough

We needed to take the film and its message to the heartland

to small towns and villages across the country

You see for me cinema can play a very positive role

in changing and molding society in a positive direction

But how would we get to these places

How would we get to these small towns and villages

We built a mobile cinema

a truck that would roll through the length and breadth of the country

that would stop in small towns and villages

We outfitted it with a large screen that would light up the night sky

and we called it Look But With Love

It would give the community an opportunity to come together

and watch films in the evening

We knew we could attract men and children in the mobile cinema

They would come out and watch

But what about women

In these small rural communities that are segregated

how would we get women to come out

We had to work with prevailing cultural norms in order to do so

and so we built a cinema inside the cinema

outfitting it with seats and a screen where women could go inside and watch

without fearing

or being embarrassed

or harassment

We began to introduce everyone

to films that opened up their minds to competing worldviews

encouraging children to build critical thinking

so that they could ask questions

And we expanded our scope beyond honor killings

talking about income inequality

the environment

talking about ethnic relations religious tolerance and compassion

And inside for women

we showed them films in which they were heroes not victims

and we told them how they could navigate the court system the police system

educating them about their rights

telling them where they could seek refuge

if they were victims of domestic violence

where they could go and get help

We were surprised that we were welcomed in so many of the places

that we went to

Many of the towns had never seen television or social media

and they were eager for their children to learn

But there was also pushback and blowback

with the ideas that we were bringing with us

Two members of our mobile cinema team resigned

because of threats from villages

And in one of the villages that we were screening in

they shut it down

and said they didn't want the women to know about their rights

But on the flip side in another village when a screening was shut down

a plainclothes policeman got up and ordered it back on

and stood by protecting our team

telling everyone that it was his duty to expose the young minds

to an alternative worldview and to this content

He was an ordinary hero

But we've come across so many of these heroes on our journey

In another town where the men said that only they could watch

and the women had to stay home

a community elder got up

got a group of people together had a discussion

and then both men and women sat down to watch together

We are documenting what we are doing

We talk to people

We adapt

We change the lineup of films

When we show men films

that show perpetrators of violence behind bars

we want to hit home the fact that if men are violent

there will be repercussions

But we also show films where men are seen as championing women

because we want to encourage them to take on those roles

For women when we show them films in which they are heads of state

or where they are lawyers and doctors and in leadership positions

we talk to them and encourage them to step into those roles

We are changing the way people in these villages interact

and we're taking our learnings into other places

Recently a group contacted us and wants to take our mobile cinema

to Bangladesh and Syria

and we're sharing our learnings with them

We feel it's really important

to take what we are doing and spread it across the world

In small towns and villages across Pakistan

men are changing the way they interact with women

children are changing the way they see the world

one village at a time through cinema

Thank you

So there's about seven and a half billion of us

The World Health Organization tells us that  million of us are depressed

and about  people take their lives every year

A tiny subset of them choose a profoundly nihilistic route

which is they die in the act of killing as many people as possible

These are some famous recent examples

And here's a less famous one It happened about nine weeks ago

If you don't remember it

it's because there's a lot of this going on

Wikipedia just last year counted  mass shootings

in my home country the United States

Not all of those shooters were suicidal

not all of them were maximizing their death tolls

but many many were

An important question becomes What limits do these people have

Take the Vegas shooter

He slaughtered  people

Did he stop there because he'd had enough

No and we know this because he shot and injured another  people

who he surely would have preferred to kill

We have no reason to think he would have stopped at 

In fact with somebody this nihilistic he may well have gladly killed us all

We don't know

What we do know is this

when suicidal murderers really go all in

technology is the force multiplier

Here's an example

Several years back there was a rash of  mass school attacks in China

carried out with things like knives and hammers and cleavers

because guns are really hard to get there

By macabre coincidence this last attack occurred

just hours before the massacre in Newtown Connecticut

But that one American attack killed roughly the same number of victims

as the  Chinese attacks combined

So we can fairly say knife terrible gun way worse
 
And airplane massively worse

as pilot Andreas Lubitz showed when he forced  people

to join him in his suicide

smashing a plane into the French Alps

And there are other examples of this

And I'm afraid there are far more deadly weapons in our near future than airplanes

ones not made of metal

So let's consider the apocalyptic dynamics that will ensue

if suicidal mass murder hitches a ride on a rapidly advancing field

that for the most part holds boundless promise for society

Somewhere out there in the world there's a tiny group of people

who would attempt however ineptly

to kill us all if they could just figure out how

The Vegas shooter may or may not have been one of them

but with seven and a half billion of us

this is a nonzero population

There's plenty of suicidal nihilists out there

We've already seen that

There's people with severe mood disorders that they can't even control

There are people who have just suffered deranging traumas etc etc

As for the corollary group

its size was simply zero forever until the Cold War

when suddenly the leaders of two global alliances

attained the ability to blow up the world

The number of people with actual doomsday buttons

has stayed fairly stable since then

But I'm afraid it's about to grow

and not just to three

This is going off the charts

I mean it's going to look like a tech business plan

Laughter

And the reason is

we're in the era of exponential technologies

which routinely take eternal impossibilities

and make them the actual superpowers of one or two living geniuses

and  this is the big part 

then diffuse those powers to more or less everybody

Now here's a benign example

If you wanted to play checkers with a computer in 

you literally had to be that guy

then commandeer one of the world's  copies of that computer

then used your Nobeladjacent brain to teach it checkers

That was the bar

Today you just need to know someone who knows someone who owns a telephone

because computing is an exponential technology

So is synthetic biology

which I'll now refer to as synbio
synbio
And in  a couple of researchers did something every bit as ingenious

and unprecedented as the checkers trick

with HN flu
HN
This is a strain that kills up to  percent of the people it infects

more than Ebola

But it is so uncontagious

that it's killed fewer than  people since 

So these researchers edited HN's genome
HN
and made it every bit as deadly but also wildly contagious

The news arm of one of the world's top two scientific journals

said if this thing got out it would likely cause a pandemic

with perhaps millions of deaths

And Dr Paul Keim said
Paul Keim
he could not think of an organism as scary as this

which is the last thing I personally want to hear

from the Chairman of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity

And by the way Dr Keim also said this 
Keim
[I don't think anthrax is scary at all compared to this]
[]
And he's also one of these

[Anthrax expert] Laughter
[]
Now the good news about the  biohack

is that the people who did it didn't mean us any harm

They're virologists

They believed they were advancing science

The bad news is that technology does not freeze in place

and over the next few decades

their feat will become trivially easy

In fact it's already way easier because as we learned yesterday morning

just two years after they did their work

the CRISPR system was harnessed for genome editing
CRISPR
This was a radical breakthrough

that makes gene editing massively easier 

so easy that CRISPR is now taught in high schools
CRISPR
And this stuff is moving quicker than computing

That slow stodgy white line up there

That's Moore's law

That shows us how quickly computing is getting cheaper

That steep crazyfun green line

that shows us how quickly genetic sequencing is getting cheaper

Now gene editing and synthesis and sequencing

they're different disciplines but they're tightly related

And they're all moving in these headlong rates

And the keys to the kingdom are these tiny tiny data files

That is an excerpt of HN's genome
HN
The whole thing can fit on just a few pages

And yeah don't worry you can Google this as soon as you get home

It's all over the internet right

And the part that made it contagious

could well fit on a single Postit note

And once a genius makes a data file

any idiot can copy it

distribute it worldwide

or print it

And I don't just mean print it on this

but soon enough on this

So let's imagine a scenario

Let's say it's  to pick an arbitrary year

and a brilliant virologist hoping to advance science

and better understand pandemics

designs a new bug

It's as contagious as chicken pox

it's as deadly as Ebola

and it incubates for months and months before causing an outbreak

so the whole world can be infected before the first sign of trouble

Then her university gets hacked

And of course this is not science fiction

In fact just one recent US indictment

documents the hacking of over  universities

So that file with the bug's genome on it spreads to the internet's dark corners

And once a file is out there it never comes back 

just ask anybody who runs a movie studio or a music label

So now maybe in 

it would take a true genius like our virologist

to make the actual living critter

but  years later

it may just take a DNA printer you can find at any high school
DNA
And if not

Give it a couple of decades

So a quick aside

Remember this slide here

Turn your attention to these two words

If somebody tries this and is only  percent effective

eight million people die

That's  s
 
Civilization would survive

but it would be permanently disfigured

So this means we need to be concerned about anybody

who has the faintest shot on goal

not just geniuses

So today there's a tiny handful of geniuses

who probably could make a doomsday bug

that's percent effective and maybe even a little bit more

They tend to be stable and successful and so not part of this group

So I guess I'm sorta kinda barely OKish with that

But what about after technology improves

and diffuses

and thousands of life science grad students are enabled

Are every single one of them going to be perfectly stable

Or how about a few years after that

where every stressridden premed is fully enabled

At some point in that time frame

these circles are going to intersect

because we're now starting to talk about hundreds of thousands of people

throughout the world

And they recently included that guy who dressed up like the Joker

and shot  people to death at a Batman premiere

That was a neuroscience PhD student

with an NIH grant
NIH
OK plot twist

I think we can actually survive this one if we start focusing on it now

And I say this having spent countless hours

interviewing global leaders in synbio
Synbio
and also researching their work for science podcasts I create

I have come to fear their work in case I haven't gotten that out there yet 

Laughter

but more than that to revere its potential

This stuff will cure cancer heal our environment

and stop our cruel treatment of other creatures

So how do we get all this without you know annihilating ourselves

First thing like it or not synbio is here
synbio
so let's embrace the technology

If we do a tech ban

that would only hand the wheel to bad actors

Unlike nuclear programs

biology can be practiced invisibly

Massive Soviet cheating on bioweapons treaties

made that very clear as does every illegal drug lab in the world

Secondly enlist the experts

Let's sign them up and make more of them

For every million and one bioengineers we have

at least a million of them are going to be on our side

I mean Al Capone would be on our side in this one

The bar to being a good guy is just so low

And massive numerical advantages do matter

even when a single bad guy can inflict grievous harm

because among many other things

they allow us to exploit the hell out of this

we have years and hopefully decades to prepare and prevent

The first person to try something awful  and there will be somebody 

may not even be born yet

Next this needs to be an effort that spans society

and all of you need to be a part of it

because we cannot ask a tiny group of experts

to be responsible for both containing and exploiting synthetic biology

because we already tried that with the financial system

and our stewards became massively corrupted

as they figured out how they could cut corners

inflict massive massive risks on the rest of us

and privatize the gains

becoming repulsively wealthy

while they stuck us with the  trillion bill

And more recently 

Applause

Are you the ones who have gotten the thankyou letters

I'm still waiting for mine

I just figured they were too busy to be grateful

And much more recently

online privacy started looming as a huge issue

and we basically outsourced it

And once again

privatized gains socialized losses

Is anybody else sick of this pattern

Applause

So we need a more inclusive way to safeguard our prosperity

our privacy

and soon our lives

So how do we do all of this

Well when bodies fight pathogens

they use ingenious immune systems

which are very complex and multilayered

Why don't we build one of these for the whole damn ecosystem

There's a year of TED Talks that could be given on this first critical layer
TED
So these are just a couple of many great ideas that are out there

Some R and D muscle
RD
could take the very primitive pathogen sensors that we currently have

and put them on a very steep price performance curve

that would quickly become ingenious

and networked

and gradually as widespread as smoke detectors and even smartphones

On a very related note

vaccines have all kinds of problems

when it comes to manufacturing and distribution

and once they're made they can't adapt to new threats or mutations

We need an agile biomanufacturing base

extending into every single pharmacy and maybe even our homes

Printer technology for vaccines and medicines is within reach

if we prioritize it

Next mental health

Many people who commit suicidal mass murder

suffer from crippling treatmentresistant depression or PTSD
PTSD
We need noble researchers like Rick Doblin working on this
Rick Doblin
but we also need the selfish jerks who are way more numerous

to appreciate the fact that acute suffering will soon endanger all of us

not just those afflicted

Those jerks will then join us and Al Capone

in fighting this condition

Third each and every one of us can be and should be a white blood cell

in this immune system

Suicidal mass murderers can be despicable yes

but they're also terribly broken and sad people

and those of us who aren't need to do what we can

to make sure nobody goes unloved

Applause

Next we need to make fighting these dangers

core to the discipline of synthetic biology

There are companies out there that at least claim

they let their engineers spend  percent of their time

doing whatever they want

What if those who hire bioengineers

and become them

give  percent of their time to building defenses for the common good

Not a bad idea right

Applause

Then finally this won't be any fun

But we need to let our minds go to some very very dark places

and thank you for letting me take you there this evening

We survived the Cold War

because every one of us understood and respected the danger

in part because we had spent decades

telling ourselves terrifying ghost stories

with names like Dr Strangelove

and War Games

This is no time to remain calm

This is one of those rare times when it's incredibly productive

to freak the hell out 

Laughter

to come up with some ghost stories

and use our fear as fuel to fight this danger

Because all these terrible scenarios I've painted 

they are not destiny

They're optional

The danger is still kind of distant

And that means it will only befall us

if we allow it to

Let's not

Thank you very much for listening

Applause

Translator Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez

So asking for help is basically the worst right

I've actually never seen it on one of those top ten lists

of things people fear

like public speaking

and death

but I'm pretty sure it actually belongs there

Even though in many ways it's foolish for us to be afraid to admit we need help

whether it's from a loved one or a friend or from a coworker

or even from a stranger

somehow it always feel just a little bit uncomfortable and embarrassing

to actually ask for help

which is of course why most of us try to avoid asking for help

whenever humanly possible

My father was one of those legions of fathers

who I swear would rather drive through an alligatorinfested swamp

than actually ask someone for help getting back to the road

When I was a kid we took a family vacation

We drove from our home in South Jersey to Colonial Williamsburg

And I remember we got really badly lost

My mother and I pleaded with him

to please just pull over and ask someone for directions back to the highway

and he absolutely refused

and in fact assured us that we were not lost

he had just always wanted to know what was over here

Laughter

So if we're going to ask for help 

and we have to we all do practically every day 

the only way we're going to even begin to get comfortable with it

is to get good at it

to actually increase the chances that when you ask for help from someone

they're actually going to say yes

And not only that but they're going to find it actually satisfying

and rewarding to help you

because that way they'll be motivated to continue to help you into the future

So research that I and some of my colleagues have done

has shed a lot of light on why it is that sometimes people say yes

to our requests for help

and why sometimes they say no

Now let me just start by saying right now

if you need help

you are going to have to ask for it

Out loud

OK

We all to some extent suffer from something that psychologists call

the illusion of transparency 

basically the mistaken belief

that our thoughts and our feelings and our needs

are really obvious to other people

This is not true but we believe it

And so we just mostly stand around waiting for someone to notice our needs

and then spontaneously offer to help us with it

This is a really really bad assumption

In fact not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are

but even the people close to you often struggle to understand

how they can support you

My partner has actually had to adopt a habit

of asking me multiple times a day

Are you OK Do you need anything
 
because I am so so bad at signaling when I need someone's help

Now he is more patient than I deserve

and much more proactive much more about helping

than any of us have any right to expect other people to be

So if you need help you're going to have to ask for it

And by the way even when someone can tell that you need help

how do they know that you want it

Did you ever try to give unsolicited help to someone who it turns out

did not actually want your help in the first place

They get nasty real quick don't they

The other day  true story 

my teenage daughter was getting dressed for school

and I decided to give her some unsolicited help about that

Laughter

I happen to think she looks amazing in brighter colors

She tends to prefer sort of darker more neutral tones

And so I said very helpfully

that I thought maybe she could go back upstairs

and try to find something a little less somber

Laughter

So if looks could kill

I would not be standing here right now

We really can't blame other people for not just spontaneously offering to help us

when we don't actually know that that's what is wanted

In fact actually research shows

that  percent of the help that coworkers give one another in the workplace

is in response to explicit requests for help

So you're going to have to say the words I need your help Right

There's no getting around it

Now to be good at it

to make sure that people actually do help you when you ask for it

there are a few other things that are very helpful to keep in mind

First thing when you ask for help

be very very specific about the help you want and why

Vague sort of indirect requests for help

actually aren't very helpful to the helper right

We don't actually know what it is you want from us

and just as important

we don't know whether or not we can be successful

in giving you the help

Nobody wants to give bad help

Like me you probably get some of these requests

from perfectly pleasant strangers on LinkedIn
LinkedIn
who want to do things like get together over coffee and connect

or pick your brain

I ignore these requests literally every time

And it's not that I'm not a nice person

It's just that when I don't know what it is you want from me

like the kind of help you're hoping that can I provide

I'm not interested

Nobody is

I'd have been much more interested if they had just come out and said

whatever it is was they were hoping to get from me

because I'm pretty sure they had something specific in mind

So go ahead and say

I'm hoping to discuss opportunities to work in your company

or I'd like to propose a joint research project

in an area I know you're interested in

or I'd like your advice on getting into medical school

Technically I can't help you with that last one

because I'm not that kind of doctor

but I could point you in the direction of someone who could

OK second tip

This is really important

please avoid disclaimers apologies and bribes

Really really important

Do any of these sound familiar

Clears throat

'I'm so so sorry that I have to ask you for this

I really hate bothering you with this

If I had any way of doing this without your help I would

Laughter

Sometimes it feels like people are so eager to prove

that they're not weak and greedy when they ask your for help

they're completely missing out on how uncomfortable

they're making you feel

And by the way  how am I supposed to find it satisfying to help you

if you really hated having to ask me for help

And while it is perfectly perfectly acceptable

to pay strangers to do things for you

you need to be very very careful when it comes to incentivizing

your friends and coworkers

When you have a relationship with someone

helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship

It's how we show one another that we care

If you introduce incentives or payments into that

what can happen is it starts to feel like it isn't a relationship

it's a transaction

And that actually is experienced as distancing

which ironically makes people less likely to help you

So a spontaneous gift

after someone gives you some help to show your appreciation and gratitude 

perfectly fine

An offer to pay your best friend to help you move into your new apartment

is not

OK third rule

and I really mean this one

please do not ask for help

over email or text

Really seriously please don't

Email and text are impersonal

I realize sometimes there's no alternative

but mostly what happens is

we like to ask for help over email and text

because it feels less awkward for us to do so

You know what else feels less awkward over email and text

Telling you no

And it turns out there's research to support this

Inperson requests for help are  times more likely to get a yes

than a request made by email

So when something is really important and you really need someone's help

make face time to make the request

or use your phone as a phone 

Laughter

to ask for the help that you need

OK

Last one and this is actually a really really important one

and probably the one that is most overlooked

when it comes to asking for help

when you ask someone for their help and they say yes

follow up with them afterward

There's a common misconception that what's rewarding about helping

is the act of helping itself

This is not true

What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed

that it had impact

that you were effective

If I have no idea how my help affected you

how am I supposed to feel about it

This happened I was a university professor for many years
 
I wrote lots and lots of letters of recommendation

for people to get jobs or to go into graduate school

And probably about  percent of them

I have no idea what happened

Now how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that

when I really have no idea if I helped you

if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted

In fact this idea of feeling effective

is part of why certain kinds of donor appeals are so so persuasive 

because they allow you to really vividly imagine

the effect that your help is going to have

Take something like DonorsChoose

You go online you can choose the individual teacher by name

whose classroom you're going to be able to help

by literally buying the specific items they've requested

like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating

An appeal like that makes it so easy for me to imagine

the good that my money will do

that I actually get an immediate sense of effectiveness

the minute I commit to giving

But you know what else they do

They follow up

Donors actually get letters from the kids in the classroom

They get pictures

They get to know that they made a difference

And this is something we need to all be doing in our everyday lives

especially if we want people to continue to give us help

over the long term

Take time to tell your colleague that the help that they gave you

really helped you land that big sale

or helped you get that interview that you were really hoping to get

Take time to tell your partner that the support they gave you

really made it possible for you to get through a tough time

Take time to tell your catsitter

that you're super happy that for some reason

this time the cats didn't break anything while you were away

and so they must have done a really good job

The bottom line is

I know  believe me I know 

that it is not easy to ask for help

We are all a little bit afraid to do it

It makes us feel vulnerable

But the reality of modern work and modern life

is that nobody does it alone

Nobody succeeds in a vacuum

More than ever we actually do have to rely on other people

on their support and collaboration in order to be successful

So when you need help ask for it out loud

And when you do do it in a way that increases your chances

that you'll get a yes

and makes the other person feel awesome for having helped you

because you both deserve it

Thank you

Applause

My name is Amy Padnani
  
and I'm an editor on the obituaries desk at the New York Times

Or as some friends call me the angel of death

Laughter

In fact people will ask me

Isn't it depressing working on obituaries

and thinking about death all the time

But you know what I tell them

Obits aren't about death they're about life

they're interesting they're relatable

Often about something you never knew

Recently for example

we had the obit for the inventor of the sock puppet

Laughter

Everyone knows what a sock puppet is

but have you ever thought about who created it

or what their life was like

Obits are a signature form of journalism

An art form if you will

It's an opportunity for a writer to weave the tale of a person's life

into a beautiful narrative

Since 

the New York Times has published thousands of obituaries

For heads of state famous celebrities

even the person who came up with the name on the Slinky

There's just one problem

Only a small percentage of them

chronicle the lives of women and people of color

That's the impetus behind a project I created

called Overlooked

which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people

who never got an obit

It's a chance for the newspaper to revisit its year existence

and fill in the gaps

for people who were for whatever reason left out

It's a chance to right the wrongs of the past

and to refocus society's lens on who is considered important

I came up with the idea when I first joined Obituaries in 

The Black Lives Matter movement was at a rolling boil

and the conversation on gender inequality had just started bubbling up again

And at the same time I wondered as a journalist and as a woman of color

what could I do to help advance this conversation

People were coming out of the shadows

to tell stories of injustices that they had faced

and I could feel their pain

So I noticed we would get these emails sometimes from readers

saying Hey why don't you have more women and people of color

in your obituaries

And I thought Yeah why don't we

Since I was new to the team I asked my colleagues

and they said Well the people who are dying today

are from a generation when women and people of color

weren't invited to the table to make a difference

Perhaps in a generation or two

we'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries

That answer just wasn't satisfying at all

Laughter

I wanted to know Where are all the dead women

Laughter

So I started thinking about how we hear about people who have died right

Number one way is through reader submissions

And so I thought

Well what if we were to look at international newspapers

or scour social media

It was around this time when 

Everything was swirling in my mind

and I came across a website about Mary Outerbridge

She was credited with introducing tennis to America in 

And I thought wow one of the biggest sports in America

was introduced by a woman

Does anyone even know that

And did she get a New York Times obituary

Spoiler alert  she did not

Laughter

So then I wondered who else we missed

And it sent me on this deep dive through the archives

There were some surprises

The pioneering journalist Ida B Wells
B
who started the campaign against lynching

The brilliant poet Sylvia Plath

Ada Lovelace a mathematician

now recognized as the first computer programmer

So I went back to my team and I said

What if we were to tell their stories now

It took a while to get buyin

There was this concern that you know

the newspaper might look bad

because it didn't get it right the first time

It was also a little weird to sort of look back at the past

rather than cover news stories of our day

But I said Guys I really think this is worthwhile

And once my team saw the value in it

they were all in

And so with the help of a dozen writers and editors

we launched on March  

with the stories of  remarkable women

And while I knew that the work my team was doing was powerful

I didn't expect the response to be equally powerful

I had hundreds of emails

They were from people who said

Thank you for finally giving these women a voice

They were from readers who said

I cried on my way to work reading these stories

because I felt seen for the first time

And they were from colleagues of mine who said

I never thought a woman of color

would be allowed to achieve something like this

at the 'New York Times'

I also got about  reader submissions

suggesting who else we might have overlooked

And some of those are my favorite stories in the project

My alltime favorite is Grandma Gatewood

Laughter

She survived  years of domestic violence at the hands of her husband

One day he beat her so badly beyond recognition

he even broke a broomstick over her head

and she threw flour in his face in response

But when the police arrived they arrested her not him

The mayor saw her in jail and took her into his own home

until she could get back on her feet

Then one day she read this article in National Geographic

about how no woman had ever hiked

the Appalachian Trail in its entirety alone

And she said You know what I'm going to do it
 
Reporters caught wind of the old grandma who is hiking through the woods

And at the finish they asked her

How did you survive so rough a place

But they had no idea what she had survived before that

So Overlooked has become wildly successful

It's becoming a TV show now on Netflix
Netflix
Laughter

Applause

I cannot wait to see this thing come to life

Something like  different publishers have reached out to me

with interest in turning Overlooked into a book

All of this clearly shows how timely and necessary this project is

It's also a reminder of how newspapers

document what's happening in our world every single day

and we have to make sure not to leave out key people

That's why even though it's been so meaningful to look back in the past

I'm plagued with the lingering question

What about the future of obituaries 

how do I diversify those

That was my original problem right

So to start answering this question I wanted to gather some information

I went down to the subsubbasement level of the New York Times Building

to the archives

We call it the morgue

Laughter

And I asked for some guidance from our archivist there

He pointed me to a book called New York Times Obituaries Index

So we handed it to the New York Genealogical Society

and they digitized it for us

And then a programmer wrote up a program that scanned all those headlines

for Mr Mrs Lady Sir all the sort of genderdefining terms

And what we found was that from  to 

only about  to  percent of our obits were on women

So next I worked with a programmer to build this tool

called the diversity analysis tool

It's a very dry name but bear with me it's super helpful

It breaks down the percentage of our obits month to month women to men

OK if that doesn't sound like much to you

this is how I used to calculate it before

Laughter

So I asked this programmer to program in a goal

and that goal was  percent

From the year of Overlooked's launch March of 
Overlook's
to March of 

I was hoping we could get to  percent of our obits on women

It was a number we hadn't achieved in a  years

and I'm happy to say we did it  we got to  percent

Applause

It's awesome but it's not enough

Next we're hoping to get to  percent

and then  percent until we achieve parity

And then I'm hoping to partner with this programmer again

to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits

That was something I wanted to do with Overlooked too

to include men of color

and I finally got to do it with a special section

for Black History Month

where we told the stories of about a dozen black men and women

Again it was a really powerful experience

Many of these people had been slaves

or were a generation removed from slavery

A lot of them had to make up stories about their past

just to get ahead in life

And there were these patterns of their struggles

that came up again and again

Elizabeth Jennings for instance

had to fight for her right to ride

on segregated street cars in New York City 

a hundred years before Rosa Parks did the exact same thing with buses
Rosa Parks
It was just a reminder of how far we've come

and how much more we still have left to do

Overlooked is including other marginalized people as well

Recently we had the obit for the computer programmer Alan Turing
Alan Turing
Believe it or not this brilliant man never got an obituary

even though his work

decoding German messages during World War II

helps end the war

Instead he died a criminal for his sexual orientation

and he was forced to endure chemical castration

Great things like this obits project do not come easily

There were a lot of fits and starts

as I worked hard to convince people it was worth getting it off the ground

There were moments when I faced great selfdoubt

I wondered if I was crazy or if I was all alone

and if I should just give up

When I've seen the reaction to this project

I know I'm not at all alone

There's so many people who feel the way I do

And so yeah not many people think about obituaries

But when you do you realize they're a testament to a human life

They're the last chance to talk about somebody's contribution on the world

They were also an example of who society deemed important

A hundred years from now

somebody could be looking into the past to see what our time was like

I'm lucky as a journalist

to have been able to have used this form of storytelling

to help shift a narrative

I was also able to get an established institution

to question its own status quo

Little by little I'm hoping I can keep doing this work

and continue refocusing society's lens

so that nobody else gets overlooked

Thank you

Applause

We are all trapped

inside our own heads

and our beliefs and our understandings about the world are limited

by that perspective

which means we tell ourselves stories

Right So here we are in this infinite data source
 
There's an infinite number of things that we could think about

but we edit and delete

We choose what to think about what to pay attention to

We make up a story 

to make sense of what's going on

and we all get it wrong

Because we're all trying to navigate with our own skewed compasses

and we all have our own baggage

but the stories themselves are utterly convincing

And we all do this

and a lot of the stories that we live by aren't even our own

The first ones we inherit at a young age from our parents

who of course have their own skewed beliefs

their own frustrations their own unlived lives

And for better or worse we take all that onboard

and then we go out into the world

thinking maybe we have to be successful to be loved

or that we always have to put other people's needs first

or that we have some big terrible secret we couldn't possible tell people

And it's just fiction it's just stories

and we'd worry a lot less about what other people think of us

if we realized how seldom they do

Laughter

So I feel that magic is a great analogy for how we edit reality and form a story

and then mistake that story for the truth

and I've had a year career in the UK

staging big psychological experiments on TV

and now that's on Netflix
Netflix
I also have a stage show

I've got my first Broadway show actually coming up called Secret

Just throwing that out there No pressure

Laughter

That should be this year

And I try to do something new with mentalism mentalism

which is the dubious art of getting inside your head

So there was a heyday for this kind of stage mindreading

which was the s

That's why I'm dressed like this

in my most unTEDlike garb
TED
And there was an act an act known as the Oracle Act

And in the Oracle Act members of the audience

as I know you have done

would write down secret questions

the sort of questions you might ask a psychic

seal that question into an envelope

and on the outside of the envelope they would write their initials

and then roughly where they sat in the audience

And then the Oracle the mind reader would take an envelope one at a time

he wouldn't open it

but he would attempt to divine what question was sealed inside

And if he got that right he would try and answer the question

for the person too

And the act spread like wildfire

It's a testament I think to the seductive appeal

of some powerful figure offering you easy simple answers

to life's complex and subtle questions

and anxieties

So thank you all of you that wrote questions

I haven't seen these I know somebody's guarding them

Thank you so much

I will take those now Thank you all of you that did this

I should say probably a couple of things before I start

In absolute honesty

first of all I can't see through these envelopes

They are sealed They are thick black envelopes

You'll know if you wrote one I can't see through them

Secondly importantly I don't know any of you

and nobody is playing along

That's not what this is

Thirdly 

I don't believe for a second that I have any special psychological gifts

let alone any psychic ones

So let's begin

Nope

Laughter

OK this 

Oh nice

OK this one's interesting There's a couple here

I will start with maybe this one

This one's interesting because the writing undulates

There's a sort of an up and down thing

which normally  not always  normally means

that the person doesn't know the answer to the question themselves

so it's normally a question about the future right

That sort of suggests uncertainty

So I would say it's a lady

agewise it's a little difficult to tell from this minimal handwriting

but I would expect maybe s maybe s but let's find out

It says  and a question about the future 

it says JN center
JN
So it's going to be somebody in this big central section here

If you think this is you if you wrote one

could you make a fuss

It's a bit difficult for me to see in the center

Hi give us a wave

So J 
J
Jane Jessica
 
Jessica Yes

Derren Brown Which one Jessica Jessica
 
DB Thank you Just a guess Little murmur of approval thank you
DB
Laughter

I'll take it

Alright so Jessica I won't ask your age

but is it a question essentially about the future

Jessica Mhm DB Yes
 DB
Jessica Yes DB Yes OK
 DB
Alright So what did we ask What did Jessica ask about the future
 
So am I OK with lates earlys

Jessica I'll take it I'm taking it

Laughter

DB OK so it's important
DB
because we ask different questions depending how old we are

Just say I'll take it again

Jessica I'll take it

DB Virginia You're from Virginia Jessica Yes I am
DB  
DB Yeah So 
DB
Laughter

I think this is a lady

I think this is a lady who wants to leave Virginia

I think you're looking at plans

it's whether or not things are going to come together to get out

Just show me your hands

Other sides so I can see fingernails

OK I think you have a farm

and it's whether or not you're going to sell your farm and get out of Virginia

Is this right

Jessica Absolutely that's the question

DB Alright Great Thank you It's a great question
DB
What was the actual question What did you put
 
Jessica Will I sell the farm in Virginia

DB Will you sell the farm
DB
Alright so look it's a great question if you are pretending to be psychic

because it's about the future

which means I can give you a yes or no on this

It means nothing You have no way of verifying it

And a dangerous thing to do 

and if I say yes or no it'll just stick in the back of your mind

and it can't not start to affect decisions you make

So a dangerous thing to do However 

Laughter

Yes I think you will sell the farm

because I think you're the sort of person

that in the nicest way will get what you want

I think when there are things you want you tend to focus on them

at the expense of other things

that you know you probably should be focusing on more

would you agree

Educated you spent a few years in 

Say yes again the word yes quickly Jessica Yes
 
DB No Jessica No
DB 
DB California Berkeley A bit of a guess but 
DB  
Jessica I went to Berkeley yes Stop doing this

DB So it's a yes
DB
Oh and you've been to India recently as well

There's just a tiny tiny little thing going on there Yes No
 
Jessica Yes I just got back from India

DB It's a yes from me I just don't want to say it like it's written in the stars
DB
because it isn't and you need to take responsibility for it

DB Have a seat Thank you Let's do another one
DB
Applause

AH also in the center AH
 
This will be a man a little older maybe late s I would say from this

AH center stand up for me if you think this is you

AH Hi let's get a microphone to this guy

Quick as we can on camera would be amazing

Oh look at that Freeze Don't move Don't move
 
Keep absolutely still

Are you standing Where are you
 
Man I am standing I'm not that short

DB OK
DB
Alright now you changed that

There was just something you did as you got up

Yes or no have you put something on here 

you're not doing it now but you did it as you stood up 

to do with your left or your left leg or your left foot yes or no

Man Yes

DB Alright He was giving us a nice clear signal as he stood up
DB
Put your weight on your lefthand side and say yes

Man Yes

DB Take your hand out of that pocket put your weight on the other side
DB
change hands with the mic and say yes again

Man Yes

DB You have a dislocation
DB
in the big toe on your lefthand side

Man Yes

DB Thank you so much Great Good one Take a seat Take a seat
DB 
Can I get the microphone I'm going to change microphone for this
 
Can I grab a mic up Thank you
 
Thank you so much That would be great there

I'm going to change mic because

hopefully you can now still hear me

So I'm going to blindfold myself

And I'm doing this now so I don't have the clues as you stand up

I can't see where you put your hands

I can't see how you respond to what I'm saying

I can't see what the people next to you are doing either

If they know the answers to the question that's always very helpful

I won't have those advantages

but strangely

this frees me up

and I want this to free you up as well

so if you didn't write a question

but you wish that you had done

you can still take part

The point of writing the question is only that it just kind of gets

a nice clear succinct wording in your head

So if you can just find a question in your head

make it clear and succinct just send it to me

and I'll try and do this now without anything written down

So just start to form questions but send me your name as well

My name is whatever that last guy was

and what's strange about my feet or whatever the question was

So name and question

There is somebody already I'm guessing you're quite near the front

because your name is quite clear

Feels like you're in the center at the front

OK let me just  Allan

Feels like there's an Allan

And you're going to be quite near the front vaguely central I think

Feels like it's coming from right there

There's like a man maybe early s something like that

Allan Yes

DB You've got a mic Great thank you
DB 
Allan just say stop when I get to you so that I know where you are

where to face

Allan Stop

DB You a Capricorn Allan Yes
 
DB So Allan has something in his head
DB
Now did you hear it hear the reserve in his voice

It's going to be something really tricky

I think with you  Just say yes again for me

Allan Yes

DB It's going to be either 
DB
no it's not

It's access it's a password or access to something

Have you got something just yes or no with a password in your head

Allan Yes

DB A computer password that sort of thing

Allan Yes

DB Excellent
DB
Laughter

In that case I'm going to finish on this one Let me 

If I get this right

they're all going to know what it is and millions of people potentially

You will change it won't you

Allan Of course

Laughter

DB Just say of course again Allan Of course
DB 
DB Alright If it's a word  I imagine it's a word right 
DB
just see the password written in front of you

big clear block capital letters

and as you look at it think for me of a letter somewhere in the middle

don't say it out loud

just get a letter in your head that's in the middle

Have you got one Allan Yeah
 
DB OK stick with that for me
DB
Ah you changed it OK

You changed your mind there

I think you settled on a 

I think that's a B yes
B
Allan No

I didn't

DB Then it's an I Allan Correct
DB 
DB But you had a B Allan Yes
B
DB Yeah he changed his mind He changed his mind

Laughter

So see it written there

Just keep saying it to yourself in your head

Oh you play drums don't you

Allan I do

DB Just get that out of your head get that out of your head

just focus on this one thing for me

Laughter

My job is to sell you a story right

I try and do this to all of you to get you to pay attention

to one thing that I want you to find important

ignore other things that I want you to ignore

and then join up those narrative dots

to tell yourself a certain story about what I'm doing

and this only works because we are storyforming creatures

which means we do this every day

We go out into this complex and subtle world

full of a complex and subtle people like you and me Allan

and we reduce them to these neat characters

that fit whatever story we're telling ourselves

and we say She's insecure He's arrogant They can't be trusted

And these are just stories like the story that I can somehow read your mind

You're thinking of selling your company as well aren't you at the moment

Allan Correct

DB Which is something to do with skin
DB
Allan Yes

DB Skin care or something like this
DB
Allan Uh yes

DB And I think the reason why I love doing this
DB
is that it reminds me at least to try and be more alive and alert

to the complexity and the subtlety of what's real

that there's always other stuff going on that we don't know about

and it means we can get less stuck we can be kinder to people

because we can recognize there's always fear behind their stress

so we don't need to meet it as defensively

and we can start to see the stories for what they are

and recognize that life isn't all about us

Oh

Your password where are you Where are you Where is he
  
Allan Right here

DB Stand up for me Your password is ariboy
DBAriboy
Ariboy Is that right Allan That's correct
Ariboy  
DB Then thank you so much Thank you very much indeed
DB
Thank you

Applause

As a roboticist I get asked a lot of questions

When we will they start serving me breakfast

So I thought the future of robotics would be looking more like us

I thought they would look like me

so I built eyes that would simulate my eyes

I built fingers that are dextrous enough to serve me 

baseballs

Classical robots like this

are built and become functional

based on the fixed number of joints and actuators

And this means their functionality and shape are already fixed

at the moment of their conception

So even though this arm has a really nice throw 

it even hit the tripod at the end

it's not meant for cooking you breakfast per se

It's not really suited for scrambled eggs

So this was when I was hit by a new vision of future robotics

the transformers

They drive they run they fly

all depending on the everchanging new environment and task at hand

To make this a reality

you really have to rethink how robots are designed

So imagine a robotic module in a polygon shape

and using that simple polygon shape

to reconstruct multiple different forms

to create a new form of robot for different tasks

In CG computer graphics it's not any news 
CG
it's been done for a while and that's how most of the movies are made

But if you're trying to make a robot that's physically moving

it's a completely new story

It's a completely new paradigm

But you've all done this

Who hasn't made a paper airplane paper boat paper crane

Origami is a versatile platform for designers

From a single sheet of paper you can make multiple shapes

and if you don't like it you unfold and fold back again

Any D form can be made from D surfaces by folding
DD
and this is proven mathematically

And imagine if you were to have an intelligent sheet

that can selffold into any form it wants

anytime

And that's what I've been working on

I call this robotic origami

robogami
robogami
This is our first robogami transformation

that was made by me about  years ago

From a flatsheeted robot

it turns into a pyramid and back into a flat sheet

and into a space shuttle

Quite cute

Ten years later with my group of ninja origami robotic researchers 

about  of them right now 

we have a new generation of robogamis

and they're a little more effective and they do more than that

So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose

For example this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously

So when it's a dry and flat land it crawls

And if it meets sudden rough terrain

it starts rolling

It does this  it's the same robot 

but depending on which terrain it meets

it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board

And once it meets an obstacle it jumps over it

It does this by storing energy in each of its legs

and releasing it and catapulting like a slingshot

And it even does gymnastics

Yay

Laughter

So I just showed you what a single robogami can do

Imagine what they can do as a group

They can join forces to tackle more complex tasks

Each module either active or passive

we can assemble them to create different shapes

Not only that by controlling the folding joints

we're able to create and attack different tasks

The form is making new task space

And this time what's most important is the assembly

They need to autonomously find each other in a different space

attach and detach depending on the environment and task

And we can do this now

So what's next

Our imagination

This is a simulation of what you can achieve

with this type of module

We decided that we were going to have a fourlegged crawler

turn into a little dog and make small gaits

With the same module we can actually make it do something else

a manipulator a typical classical robotic task

So with a manipulator it can pick up an object

Of course you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer

to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller

or even have a third arm

For robogamis there's no one fixed shape nor task
robogamis
They can transform into anything anywhere anytime

So how do you make them

The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin
Robogami
flexible

but still remaining functional

They're composed of multiple layers of circuits motors

microcontrollers and sensors

all in the single body

and when you control individual folding joints

you'll be able to achieve soft motions like that

upon your command

Instead of being a single robot that is specifically made for a single task

robogamis are optimized to do multitasks
Robogamis
And this is quite important

for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth

as well as in space

Space is a perfect environment for robogamis

You cannot afford to have one robot for one task

Who knows how many tasks you will encounter in space

What you want is a single robotic platform that can transform to do multitasks

What we want is a deck of thin robogami modules

that can transform to do multiples of performing tasks

And don't take my word for it

because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center

are sponsoring this exact concept

So here you see a couple of images of reconfiguration of robogamis

exploring the foreign land aboveground on the surface

as well as digging into the surface

It's not just exploration

For astronauts they need additional help

because you cannot afford to bring interns up there either

Laughter

They have to do every tedious task

They may be simple

but super interactive

So you need robots to facilitate their experiments

assisting them with the communications

and just docking onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools

But how will they be able to control robogamis for example

outside the space station

In this case I show a robogami that is holding space debris

You can work with your vision so that you can control them

but what would be better is having the sensation of touch

directly transported onto the hands of the astronauts

And what you need is a haptic device

a haptic interface that recreates the sensation of touch

And using robogamis we can do this

This is the world's smallest haptic interface

that can recreate a sensation of touch just underneath your fingertip

We do this by moving the robogami

by microscopic and macroscopic movements at the stage

And by having this not only will you be able to feel

how big the object is

the roundness and the lines

but also the stiffness and the texture

Alex has this interface just underneath his thumb
Alex
and if he were to use this with VR goggles and hand controllers
VR
now the virtual reality is no longer virtual

It becomes a tangible reality

The blue ball red ball and black ball that he's looking at

is no longer differentiated by colors

Now it is a rubber blue ball sponge red ball and billiard black ball

This is now possible

Let me show you

This is really the first time this is shown live

in front of a public grand audience

so hopefully this works

So what you see here is an atlas of anatomy

and the robogami haptic interface
robogami
So like all the other reconfigurable robots

it multitasks
IT
Not only is it going to serve as a mouse

but also a haptic interface

So for example we have a white background where there is no object

That means there is nothing to feel

so we can have a very very flexible interface

Now I use this as a mouse to approach skin

a muscular arm

so now let's feel his biceps

or shoulders

So now you see how much stiffer it becomes

Let's explore even more

Let's approach the ribcage

And as soon as I move on top of the ribcage

and between the intercostal muscles

which is softer and harder

I can feel the difference of the stiffness

Take my word for it

So now you see it's much stiffer in terms of the force

it's giving back to my fingertip

So I showed you the surfaces that aren't moving

How about if I were to approach something that moves

for example like a beating heart

What would I feel

Applause

This can be your beating heart

This can actually be inside your pocket

while you're shopping online

Now you'll be able to feel the difference of the sweater that you're buying

how soft it is

if it's actually cashmere or not

or the bagel that you're trying to buy

how hard it is or how crispy it is

This is now possible

The robotics technology is advancing to be more personalized and adaptive

to adapt to our everyday needs

This unique specie of reconfigurable robotics

is actually the platform to provide this invisible intuitive interface

to meet our exact needs

These robots will no longer look like the characters from the movies

Instead they will be whatever you want them to be

Thank you

Applause

This is a strange and wonderful brain

one that gives rise to an idea of a kind of alternative intelligence

on this planet

This is a brain that is formed in a very strange body

one that has the equivalent of small satellite brains

distributed throughout that body

How different is it from the human brain

Very different so it seems

so much so that my colleagues and I are struggling to understand

how that brain works

But what I can tell you for certain

is that this brain is capable of some amazing things

So who does this brain belong to

Well join me for a little bit of diving into the ocean

where life began

and let's have a look

You may have seen some of this before

but we're behind a coral reef and there's this rock out there

a lot of sand fishes swimming around 

And all of a sudden this octopus appears

and now it flashes white

inks in my face and jets away

In slow motion reverse

you see the ring develop around the eye

and then the pattern develops in the skin

And now watch the D texture of the skin change

to really create this beautiful D camouflage

So there are  million color organs called chromatophores in the skin

and all those bumps out there which we call papillae

and they're all neurally controlled and can change instantaneously

I would argue that dynamic camouflage

is a form of intelligence

The level of complexity of the skin with fast precision change

is really quite astonishing

So what can you do with this skin

Well let's think a little bit about other things besides camouflage

that they can do with their skin

Here you see the mimic octopus and a pattern

All of a sudden it changes dramatically 

that's signaling not camouflage

And then it goes back to the normal pattern

Then you see the broadclub cuttlefish

showing this passing cloud display as it approaches a crab prey

And finally you see the flamboyant cuttlefish in camouflage

and it can shift instantly to this bright warning display

What we have here is a sliding scale of expression

a continuum if you will

between conspicuousness and camouflage

And this requires a lot of control

Well guess what

Brains are really good for control

The brain of the octopus shown here has  lobes to the brain

 million tiny cells

And even though that's interesting

what's really odd is that the skin of this animal

has many more neurons as illustrated here especially in the yellow

There are  million neurons in the skin

and only  million in the brain itself 

four times as many

Now if you look at that

there's actually one of those little satellite brains

and the equivalent of the spinal cord for each of the eight arms

This is a very unusual way to construct a nervous system in a body

Well what is that brain good for

That brain has to outwit other big smart brains

that are trying to eat it

and that includes porpoises and seals

and barracudas and sharks

and even us humans

So decisionmaking is one of the things that this brain has to do

and it does a very good job of it

Shown here you see this octopus perambulating along

and then it suddenly stops and creates that perfect camouflage

And it's really marvelous

because when these animals forage in the wild

they have to make over a hundred camouflaging decisions

in a twohour forage

and they do that twice a day

So decisionmaking

They're also figuring out where to go and how to get back home

So it's a decisionmaking thing

We can test this camouflage

like that cuttlefish you see behind me

where we pull the rug out from under it

and give it a checkerboard

and it even uses that strange visual information

and does its best to match the pattern with a little adlibbing

So other cognitive skills are important too

The squids have a different kind of smarts if you will

They have an extremely complex interesting sex life

They have fighting and flirting and courting and mateguarding

and deception

Sound familiar

Laughter

And it's really quite amazing

that these animals have this kind of intuitive ability

to do these behaviors

Here you see a male and a female

The male on the left has been fighting off other males

to pair with the female

and now he's showing a dual pattern

He shows courtship and love on her side

fighting on the other

Watch him when she shifts places 

Laughter

and you see that he has fluidly changed the lovecourtship pattern

to the side of the female

So this kind of dual signaling simultaneously

with a changing behavioral context

is really extraordinary

It takes a lot of brain power

Now another way to look at this is that hmm

maybe we have  million years of evidence for the twofaced male

Laughter

All right let's move on

Laughter

An octopus on a coral reef has a tough job in front it

to go to so many places remember and find its den

And they do this extremely well

They have short and longterm memory

they learn things in three to five trials 

it's a good brain

And the spatial memory is unusually good

They will even end their forage and make a beeline

all the way back to their den

The divers watching them are completely lost

but they can get back

so it's really quite refined memory capability

Now in terms of cognitive skills

look at this sleeping behavior in the cuttlefish

Especially on the right you see the eye twitching

This is rapid eye movement kind of dreaming

that we only thought mammals and birds did

And you see the false color we put in there

to see the skin patterning flashing

and this is what's happening a lot

But it's not normal awake behaviors it's all different
 
Well dreaming is when you have memory consolidation

and so this is probably what's happening in the cuttlefish

Now another form of memory that's really unusual

is episodiclike memory

This is something that humans need four years of brain development to do

to remember what happened during a particular event

where it happened and when it happened

The when part is particularly difficult

and these children can do that

But guess what

We find recently that the wily cuttlefish also has this ability

and in experiments last summer

when you present a cuttlefish with different foods at different times

they have to match that with where it was exactly

and when was the last time they saw it

Then they have to guide their foraging to the rate of replenishment

of each food type in a different place

Sound complicated

It's so complicated I hardly understood the experiment

So this is really highlevel cognitive processing

Now speaking of brains and evolution at the moment

you look on the right there's the pathway of vertebrate brain evolution

and we all have good brains

I think everyone will acknowledge that

But if you look on the left side

some of the evolutionary pathway outlined here to the octopus

they have both converged if you will to complex behaviors

and some form of intelligence

The last common denominator in these two lines

was  million years ago

and it was a worm with very few neurons

so very divergent paths

but convergence of complicated behavior

Here is the fundamental question

Is the brain structure of an octopus

basically different down to the tiniest level

from the vertebrate line

Now we don't know the answer

but if it turns out to be yes

then we have a different evolutionary pathway

to create intelligence on planet Earth

and one might think that the artificial intelligence community

might be interested in those mechanisms

Well let's talk genetics just for a moment

We have genomes we have DNA
DNA
DNA is transcripted into RNA
DNARNA
RNA translates that into a protein and that's how we come to be
RNA
Well the cephalopods do it differently

They have big genomes they have DNA
DNA
they transcript it into RNA
RNA
but now something dramatically different happens

They edit that RNA at an astronomical weird rate
RNA
a hundredfold more than we as humans or other animals do

And it produces scores of proteins

And guess where most of them are for

The nervous system

So perhaps this is an unorthodox way

for an animal to evolve behavioral plasticity

This is a lot of conjecture but it's food for thought

Now I'd like to share with you for a moment

my experience and using my smarts and that of my colleagues

to try and get this kind of information

We're diving we can't stay underwater forever

because we can't breathe it

so we have to be efficient in what we do

The total sensory immersion into that world

is what helps us understand what these animals are really doing

and I have to tell you that it's really an amazing experience

to be down there and having this communication

with an octopus and a diver

when you really begin to understand that this is a thinking cogitating

curious animal

And this is the kind of thing that really inspires me endlessly

Let's go back to that smart skin for a few moments

Here's a squid and a camouflage pattern

We zoom down and we see there's beautiful pigments and reflectors

There are the chromatophores opening and closing very quickly

And then in the next layer of skin

it's quite interesting

The chromatophores are closed

and you see this magical iridescence just come out of the skin

This is also neurally controlled

so it's the combination of the two

as seen here in the highresolution skin of the cuttlefish

where you get this beautiful pigmentary structural coloration

and even the faint blushing that is so beautiful

Well how can we make use of some of this information

I talked about those skin bumps the papillae

Here's the giant Australian cuttlefish

It's got smooth skin and a conspicuous pattern

I took five pictures in a row one second apart

and just watch this animal morph  one two three four five 

and now I'm a seaweed

And then we can come right back out of it

to see the smooth skin and the conspicuousness

So this is really marvelous morphing skin

You can see it in more detail here

Periscope up

and you've got those beautiful papillae

And then we look in a little more detail

you can see the individual papillae come up

and there are little ridges on there

so it's a papilla on papilla and so forth

Every individual species out there has more than a dozen shapes and sizes

of those bumps

to create finetuned neurally controlled camouflage

So now my colleagues at Cornell engineers

watched our work and said We think we can make some of those

Because in industry and society

this kind of soft materials under control of shape

are really very rare

And they went ahead worked with us

and made the first samples of artificial papillae soft materials

shown here

And you see them blown up into different shapes

And then you can press your finger on them

to see that they're a little bit malleable as they are

And so this is an example of how that might work

Well I want to segue from this into the color of fabrics

and I imagine that could have a lot of applications as well

Just look at this kaleidoscope of color

of dynamically controlled pigments and reflectors

that we see in the cephalopods

We know enough about the mechanics of how they work

that we can begin to translate this

not only into fabrics

but perhaps even into changeable cosmetics

And moreover there's been the recent discovery

of lightsensing molecules in the skin of octopus

which may pave the way to eventually smart materials

that sense and respond on their own

Well this form of biotechnology or biomimicry if you will

could change the way we look at the world even above water

Take for example artificial intelligence

that might be inspired by the bodydistributed brain

and behavior of the octopus

or the smart skin of a cuttlefish

translated into cuttingedge fashion

Well how do we get there

Maybe all we have to do

is to begin to be a little bit smarter

about how smart the cephalopods are

Thank you

Preparing for this talk has been scarier for me

than preparing for LSD therapy
LSD
Laughter

Psychedelics are to the study of the mind

what the microscope is to biology

and the telescope is to astronomy

Dr Stanislav Grof spoke those words
Stanislav Grof
He's one of the leading psychedelic researchers in the world

and he's also been my mentor

Today I'd like to share with you how psychedelics when used wisely

have the potential to help heal us

help inspire us

and perhaps even to help save us

In the s and s

psychedelic research flourished all over the world

and showed great promise for the fields of psychiatry

psychology and psychotherapy

neuroscience and the study of mystical experiences

But psychedelics leaked out of the research settings

and began to be used by the counterculture

and by the antiVietnam War movement

And there was unwise use

And so there was a backlash

And in  the US government criminalized all uses of psychedelics

and they began shutting down all psychedelic research

And this ban spread all over the world and lasted for decades

and it was tragic

since psychedelics are really just tools

and whether their outcomes are beneficial or harmful

depends on how they're used

Psychedelic means mindmanifesting

and it relates to drugs like LSD psilocybin mescaline
LSD
iboga and other drugs

When I was  years old

I was a college freshman

I was experimenting with LSD and mescaline

and these experiences brought me in touch with my emotions

And they helped me have a spiritual connection

that unfortunately my bar mitzvah did not produce

Laughter

When I wanted to tease my parents

I would tell them that they drove me to psychedelics

because my bar mitzvah had failed to turn me into a man

Laughter

But most importantly

psychedelics gave me this feeling of our shared humanity

of our unity with all life

And other people reported that same thing as well

And I felt that these experiences had the potential

to help be an antidote

to tribalism to fundamentalism to genocide and environmental destruction

And so I decided to focus my life

on changing the laws

and becoming a legal psychedelic psychotherapist

Applause

Now half a century after the ban

we're in the midst of a global renaissance of psychedelic research

Psychedelic psychotherapy is showing great promise

for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD
PTSD
depression social anxiety substance abuse and alcoholism

and suicide

Psychedelic psychotherapy is an attempt to go after the root causes

of the problems

with just relatively few administrations

as contrasted to most of the psychiatric drugs used today

that are mostly just reducing symptoms

and are meant to be taken on a daily basis

Psychedelics are now also being used as tools for neuroscience

to study brain function

and to study the enduring mystery of human consciousness

And psychedelics and the mystical experiences they produce

are being explored for their connections between meditation and mindfulness

including a paper just recently published

about lifelong zen meditators taking psilocybin
About lifelong zen meditators taking psilocybin
in the midst of a meditation retreat

and showing longterm benefits and brain changes

Now how do these drugs work

Modern neuroscience research has demonstrated

that psychedelics reduce activity

in what's known as the brain's default mode network

This is where we create our sense of self

It's our equivalent to the ego

and it filters all incoming information

according to our personal needs and priorities

When activity is reduced in the default mode network

our ego shifts from the foreground to the background

and we see that it's just part of a larger field of awareness

It's similar to the shift

that Copernicus and Galileo were able to produce in humanity

using the telescope

to show that the earth was no longer the center of the universe

but was actually something that revolved around the sun

something bigger than itself

For some people this shift in awareness

is the most important

and among the most important experiences of their lives

They feel more connected to the world bigger than themselves

They feel more altruistic

and they lose some of their fear of death

Not all drugs work this way

MDMA also known as Ecstasy or Molly

works fundamentally different

And I'll be able to share with you the story of Marcela

who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder

from a violent sexual assault

Marcela and I were introduced in 

when MDMA was still legal
MDMA
but it was beginning also to leak out of therapeutic circles

Marcela had tried MDMA in a recreational setting
MarcelaMDMA
and during that her past trauma flooded her awareness

and it intensified her suicidal feelings

During our first conversation

I shared that when MDMA is taken therapeutically
MDMA
it can reduce the fear of difficult emotions

and she could help move forward past her trauma

I asked her to promise not to commit suicide

if we were to work together

She agreed and made that promise

During her therapeutic sessions

Marcela was able to process her trauma more fluidly more easily

And yet she was able to tell

that the rapist had told her that if she ever shared her story

he would kill her

And she realized that that was keeping her a prisoner in her own mind

So being able to share the story

and experience the feelings and the thoughts in her mind

freed her

and she was able to decide

that she wanted to move forward with her life

And in that moment

I realized that MDMA could be very effective for treating PTSD
MDMAPTSD
Now  years later after Marcela's treatment

she's actually a therapist

training other therapists to help people overcome PTSD with MDMA
PTSDMDMA
Now how does MDMA work
MDMA
How did MDMA help Marcela
MDMAMarcela
People who have PTSD have brains that are different

from those of us who don't have PTSD

They have a hyperactive amygdala where we process fear

They have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex

where we think logically

And they have reduced activity in the hippocampus

where we store memories into longterm storage

MDMA changes the brain in the opposite way
MDMA
MDMA reduces activity in the amygdala
MDMA
increases activity in the prefrontal cortex

and increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus

to remit traumatic memories to move into longterm storage

Recently researchers at Johns Hopkins published a paper in Nature

in which they demonstrated that MDMA releases oxytocin
MDMA
the hormone of love and nurturing

The same researchers also did studies in octopuses

who are normally asocial unless it's mating season

But lo and behold you give them MDMA
MDMA
and they become prosocial

Laughter

Several months after Marcela and I worked together

the Drug Enforcement Administration moved to criminalize Ecstasy

having no knowledge of its therapeutic use

So I went to Washington

and I went into the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Administration

and I filed a lawsuit demanding a hearing

at which psychiatrists and psychotherapists

would be able to present information about therapeutic use of MDMA
MDMA
to try to keep it legal

And in the middle of the hearing the DEA freaked out

declared an emergency

and criminalized all uses of MDMA
MDMA
And so the only way that I could see to bring it back

was through science through medicine

and through the FDA drug development process
FDA
So in  I started MAPS
MAPS
as a nonprofit psychedelic pharmaceutical company

It took us  years till 

to develop the data that we needed to present to FDA
FDA
to request permission to move into the largescale Phase  studies

that are required to prove safety and efficacy

before you get approval for prescription use

Tony was a veteran in one of our pilot studies

According to the Veterans Administration

there's over a million veterans now disabled with PTSD

And at least  veterans a day are committing suicide

many of them from PTSD

The treatment that Tony was to receive was three and a half months long

But during that period of time

he would only get MDMA on three occasions
MDMA
separated by  minute nondrug psychotherapy sessions

three before the first MDMA session for preparation

and three after each MDMA session for integration
MDMA
We call our treatment approach innerdirected therapy

in that we support the patient to experience whatever's emerging

within their minds or their bodies

Even with MDMA this is hard work
MDMA
And a lot of our subjects have said

I don't know why they call this Ecstasy

Laughter

During Tony's first MDMA session
MDMA
he lay on the couch he had eyeshades on

he listened to music

and he would speak to the therapists

who were a malefemale cotherapy team

whenever he felt that he needed to

After several hours

in a moment of calmness and clarity

Tony shared that he had realized

his PTSD was a way of connecting him to his friends

It was a way of honoring the memory of his friends who had died

But he was able to shift and see himself through the eyes of his dead friends

And he realized that they would not want him to suffer

to squander his life

They would want him to live more fully

which they were unable to do

And so he realized that there was a new way to honor their memory

which was to live as fully as possible

He also realized that he was telling himself a story

that he was taking opiates for pain

But actually he realized he was taking them for escape

So he decided he didn't need the opiates anymore

he didn't need the MDMA anymore
MDMA
and he was dropping out of the study

That was seven years ago

Tony is still free of PTSD

has never returned to opiates

and is helping others less fortunate than himself in Cambodia

Applause

The data that we presented to FDA
FDA
from  people in our pilot studies including Tony

showed that  percent of the people that received therapy without active MDMA
MDMA
no longer had PTSD at the end of treatment
PTSD
This is really pretty good for this patient population

However when you add MDMA
MDMA
the results more than double to  percent no longer having PTSD
PTSD
Applause

But most importantly

once people learn that if they don't need to suppress their trauma

but they can process it

they keep getting better on their own

So at the month followup one year after the last treatment session

twothirds no longer have PTSD

And of the onethird that do

many have clinically significant reductions in symptoms

Applause

On the basis of this data

the FDA has declared MDMAassisted psychotherapy for PTSD
FDAMDMAPTSD
a breakthrough therapy

FDA has also declared psilocybin a breakthrough therapy
FDA
for treatmentresistant depression

and just recently approved esketamine for depression
esketamine
I'm proud to say that we have now initiated our Phase  studies

And if the results are as we hope

and if they're similar to the Phase  studies

by the end of  FDA will approve MDMAassisted psychotherapy for PTSD
FDAMDMAPTSD
If approved

the only therapists who will be able to directly administer it to patients

are going to be therapists that have been through our training program

and they will only be able to administer MDMA
MDMA
under direct supervision in clinic settings

We anticipate that over the next several decades

there will be thousands of psychedelic clinics established

at which therapists will be able to administer MDMA
MDMA
psilocybin ketamine and other psychedelics

to potentially millions of patients

These clinics can also evolve into centers where people can come

for psychedelic psychotherapy for personal growth

for couples therapy

or for spiritual mystical experiences

Humanity now is in a race between catastrophe and consciousness

The psychedelic renaissance is here to help consciousness triumph

And now if you all just look under your seats 

Just joking

Corey Hajim You've got to stay up here for a minute

Thank you so much Rick

I guess it's a supportive audience

Rick Doblin Yes very

Many of them have also been to Burning Man

Laughter

CH There's some synergy
CH
RD Laughs
RD
CH So in your talk you talked about using these drugs

to address some pretty serious traumas

So what about some more common mental illnesses

like anxiety and depression

and is that where microdosing comes in

RD Well microdosing can be helpful for depression
RD
I do know someone that has been using it

But in general for therapeutic purposes

we prefer macrodosing rather than microdosing

in order to really help people deal with the root causes

Microdosing is more for creativity

for artistic inspiration

for focus 

And it also does have a moodelevation lift

But I think for serious illnesses

we'd rather not get people thinking that they need a daily drug

but do more deeper intense work

CH And what about outside the United States and North America
CH
is this research being done there

RD Oh yeah we're globalizing
RD
Our Phase  studies are actually being done

in Israel Canada and the United States

So once we get approval in FDA
FDA
it will also become approved in Israel and in Canada

We're just starting research in Europe

And we're actually going to be training some therapists from China

CH That's great
CH
We were going to do an audience vote

to see if people felt like this was a good idea

to move forward with this research or not

but I have a feeling I know the answer to that so 

Thank you so much Rick

RD Thank you Thank you all

I want to talk today about how reading can change our lives

and about the limits of that change

I want to talk to you about how reading can give us a shareable world

of powerful human connection

But also about how that connection is always partial

How reading is ultimately a lonely idiosyncratic undertaking

The writer who changed my life

was the great African American novelist James Baldwin

When I was growing up in Western Michigan in the s

there weren't many Asian American writers interested in social change

And so I think I turned to James Baldwin

as a way to fill this void as a way to feel racially conscious

But perhaps because I knew I wasn't myself African American

I also felt challenged and indicted by his words

Especially these words

There are liberals who have all the proper attitudes

but no real convictions

When the chips are down and you somehow expect them to deliver

they are somehow not there

They are somehow not there

I took those words very literally

Where should I put myself

I went to the Mississippi Delta

one of the poorest regions in the United States

This is a place shaped by a powerful history

In the s African Americans risked their lives to fight for education

to fight for the right to vote

I wanted to be a part of that change

to help young teenagers graduate and go to college

When I got to the Mississippi Delta

it was a place that was still poor

still segregated

still dramatically in need of change

My school where I was placed

had no library no guidance counselor

but it did have a police officer

Half the teachers were substitutes

and when students got into fights

the school would send them to the local county jail

This is the school where I met Patrick

He was  and held back twice he was in the eighth grade

He was quiet introspective

like he was always in deep thought

And he hated seeing other people fight

I saw him once jump between two girls when they got into a fight

and he got himself knocked to the ground

Patrick had just one problem

He wouldn't come to school

He said that sometimes school was just too depressing

because people were always fighting and teachers were quitting

And also his mother worked two jobs and was just too tired to make him come

So I made it my job to get him to come to school

And because I was crazy and  and zealously optimistic

my strategy was just to show up at his house

and say Hey why don't you come to school

And this strategy actually worked

he started to come to school every day

And he started to flourish in my class

He was writing poetry he was reading books

He was coming to school every day

Around the same time

that I had figured out how to connect to Patrick

I got into law school at Harvard

I once again faced this question where should I put myself

where do I put my body

And I thought to myself

that the Mississippi Delta was a place where people with money

people with opportunity

those people leave

And the people who stay behind

are the people who don't have the chance to leave

I didn't want to be a person who left

I wanted to be a person who stayed

On the other hand I was lonely and tired

And so I convinced myself that I could do more change

on a larger scale if I had a prestigious law degree

So I left

Three years later

when I was about to graduate from law school

my friend called me

and told me that Patrick had got into a fight and killed someone

I was devastated

Part of me didn't believe it

but part of me also knew that it was true

I flew down to see Patrick

I visited him in jail

And he told me that it was true

That he had killed someone

And he didn't want to talk more about it

I asked him what had happened with school

and he said that he had dropped out the year after I left

And then he wanted to tell me something else

He looked down and he said that he had had a baby daughter

who was just born

And he felt like he had let her down

That was it our conversation was rushed and awkward

When I stepped outside the jail a voice inside me said

Come back

If you don't come back now you'll never come back

So I graduated from law school and I went back

I went back to see Patrick

I went back to see if I could help him with his legal case

And this time when I saw him a second time

I thought I had this great idea I said

Hey Patrick why don't you write a letter to your daughter

so that you can keep her on your mind

And I handed him a pen and a piece of paper

and he started to write

But when I saw the paper that he handed back to me

I was shocked

I didn't recognize his handwriting

he had made simple spelling mistakes

And I thought to myself that as a teacher

I knew that a student could dramatically improve

in a very quick amount of time

but I never thought that a student could dramatically regress

What even pained me more

was seeing what he had written to his daughter

He had written

I'm sorry for my mistakes I'm sorry for not being there for you

And this was all he felt he had to say to her

And I asked myself how can I convince him that he has more to say

parts of himself that he doesn't need to apologize for

I wanted him to feel

that he had something worthwhile to share with his daughter

For every day the next seven months

I visited him and brought books

My tote bag became a little library

I brought James Baldwin

I brought Walt Whitman CS Lewis

I brought guidebooks to trees to birds

and what would become his favorite book the dictionary

On some days

we would sit for hours in silence both of us reading

And on other days

we would read together we would read poetry

We started by reading haikus hundreds of haikus

a deceptively simple masterpiece

And I would ask him Share with me your favorite haikus

And some of them are quite funny

So there's this by Issa
Issa
Don't worry spiders I keep house casually

And this Napped half the day no one punished me

And this gorgeous one which is about the first day of snow falling

Deer licking first frost from each other's coats

There's something mysterious and gorgeous

just about the way a poem looks

The empty space is as important as the words themselves

We read this poem by WS Merwin
WS
which he wrote after he saw his wife working in the garden

and realized that they would spend the rest of their lives together

Let me imagine that we will come again

when we want to and it will be spring

We will be no older than we ever were

The worn griefs will have eased like the early cloud

through which morning slowly comes to itself

I asked Patrick what his favorite line was and he said

We will be no older than we ever were

He said it reminded him of a place where time just stops

where time doesn't matter anymore

And I asked him if he had a place like that

where time lasts forever

And he said My mother

When you read a poem alongside someone else

the poem changes in meaning

Because it becomes personal to that person becomes personal to you

We then read books we read so many books

we read the memoir of Frederick Douglass

an American slave who taught himself to read and write

and who escaped to freedom because of his literacy

I had grown up thinking of Frederick Douglass as a hero

and I thought of this story as one of uplift and hope

But this book put Patrick in a kind of panic

He fixated on a story Douglass told of how over Christmas

masters give slaves gin

as a way to prove to them that they can't handle freedom

Because slaves would be stumbling on the fields

Patrick said he related to this

He said that there are people in jail who like slaves

don't want to think about their condition

because it's too painful

Too painful to think about the past

too painful to think about how far we have to go

His favorite line was this line

Anything no matter what to get rid of thinking

It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me

Patrick said that Douglass was brave to write to keep thinking

But Patrick would never know how much he seemed like Douglass to me

How he kept reading even though it put him in a panic

He finished the book before I did

reading it in a concrete stairway with no light

And then we went on to read one of my favorite books

Marilynne Robinson's Gilead

which is an extended letter from a father to his son

He loved this line

I'm writing this in part to tell you

that if you ever wonder what you've done in your life 

you have been God's grace to me

a miracle something more than a miracle

Something about this language its love its longing its voice

rekindled Patrick's desire to write

And he would fill notebooks upon notebooks

with letters to his daughter

In these beautiful intricate letters

he would imagine him and his daughter going canoeing down the Mississippi river

He would imagine them finding a mountain stream

with perfectly clear water

As I watched Patrick write

I thought to myself

and I now ask all of you

how many of you have written a letter to somebody you feel you have let down

It is just much easier to put those people out of your mind

But Patrick showed up every day facing his daughter

holding himself accountable to her

word by word with intense concentration

I wanted in my own life

to put myself at risk in that way

Because that risk reveals the strength of one's heart

Let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question

Who am I to tell this story as in this Patrick story

Patrick's the one who lived with this pain

and I have never been hungry a day in my life

I thought about this question a lot

but what I want to say is that this story is not just about Patrick

It's about us

it's about the inequality between us

The world of plenty

that Patrick and his parents and his grandparents

have been shut out of

In this story I represent that world of plenty

And in telling this story I didn't want to hide myself

Hide the power that I do have

In telling this story I wanted to expose that power

and then to ask

how do we diminish the distance between us

Reading is one way to close that distance

It gives us a quiet universe that we can share together

that we can share in equally

You're probably wondering now what happened to Patrick

Did reading save his life

It did and it didn't

When Patrick got out of prison

his journey was excruciating

Employers turned him away because of his record

his best friend his mother died at age 

from heart disease and diabetes

He's been homeless he's been hungry

So people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me

Being literate didn't stop him form being discriminated against

It didn't stop his mother from dying

So what can reading do

I have a few answers to end with today

Reading charged his inner life

with mystery with imagination

with beauty

Reading gave him images that gave him joy

mountain ocean deer frost

Words that taste of a free natural world

Reading gave him a language for what he had lost

How precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott
Derek Walcott
Patrick memorized this poem

Days that I have held

days that I have lost

days that outgrow like daughters

my harboring arms

Reading taught him his own courage

Remember that he kept reading Frederick Douglass

even though it was painful

He kept being conscious even though being conscious hurts

Reading is a form of thinking

that's why it's difficult to read because we have to think

And Patrick chose to think rather than to not think

And last reading gave him a language to speak to his daughter

Reading inspired him to want to write

The link between reading and writing is so powerful

When we begin to read

we begin to find the words

And he found the words to imagine the two of them together

He found the words

to tell her how much he loved her

Reading also changed our relationship with each other

It gave us an occasion for intimacy

to see beyond our points of view

And reading took an unequal relationship

and gave us a momentary equality

When you meet somebody as a reader

you meet him for the first time

newly freshly

There is no way you can know what his favorite line will be

What memories and private griefs he has

And you face the ultimate privacy of his inner life

And then you start to wonder Well what is my inner life made of

What do I have that's worthwhile to share with another

I want to close

on some of my favorite lines from Patrick's letters to his daughter

The river is shadowy in some places

but the light shines through the cracks of trees 

On some branches hang plenty of mulberries

You stretch your arm straight out to grab some

And this lovely letter where he writes

Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the words

I know this poem by heart

and I would like you to know it too

Thank you so much everyone

Applause

So we all have bad seasons in life

And I had one in 

My marriage had just ended

and I was humiliated by that failed commitment

My kids had left home for college or were leaving

I grew up mostly in the conservative movement

but conservatism had changed

so I lost a lot of those friends too

And so what I did is I lived alone in an apartment

and I just worked

If you opened the kitchen drawers where there should have been utensils

there were Postit notes

If you opened the other drawers where there should have been plates

I had envelopes

I had work friends weekday friends but I didn't have weekend friends

And so my weekends were these long howling silences

And I was lonely

And loneliness unexpectedly came to me in the form of 

it felt like fear a burning in my stomach

And it felt a little like drunkenness

just making bad decisions just fluidity lack of solidity

And the painful part of that moment was the awareness

that the emptiness in my apartment was just reflective of the emptiness

in myself

and that I had fallen for some of the lies that our culture tells us

The first lie is that career success is fulfilling

I've had a fair bit of career success

and I've found that it helps me avoid the shame I would feel

if I felt myself a failure

but it hasn't given me any positive good

The second lie is I can make myself happy

that if I just win one more victory

lose  pounds do a little more yoga

I'll get happy

And that's the lie of selfsufficiency

But as anybody on their deathbed will tell you

the things that make people happy is the deep relationships of life

the losing of selfsufficiency

The third lie is the lie of the meritocracy

The message of the meritocracy is you are what you accomplish

The myth of the meritocracy is you can earn dignity

by attaching yourself to prestigious brands

The emotion of the meritocracy is conditional love

you can earn your way to love

The anthropology of the meritocracy is you're not a soul to be purified

you're a set of skills to be maximized

And the evil of the meritocracy

is that people who've achieved a little more than others

are actually worth a little more than others

And so the wages of sin are sin

And my sins were the sins of omission

not reaching out failing to show up for my friends

evasion avoiding conflict

And the weird thing was that as I was falling into the valley 

it was a valley of disconnection 

a lot of other people were doing that too

And that's sort of the secret to my career

a lot of the things that happen to me

are always happening to a lot of other people

I'm a very average person with above average communication skills

Laughter

And so I was detached

And at the same time a lot of other people were detached

and isolated and fragmented from each other

Thirtyfive percent of Americans over  are chronically lonely

Only eight percent of Americans report having meaningful conversation

with their neighbors

Only  percent of Americans say they trust their neighbors

and only  percent of millennials

The fastestgrowing political party is unaffiliated

The fastestgrowing religious movement is unaffiliated

Depression rates are rising mental health problems are rising

The suicide rate has risen  percent since 

For teen suicides over the last several years

the suicide rate has risen by  percent

Fortyfive thousand Americans kill themselves every year

 die from opioid addictions

life expectancy is falling not rising

So what I mean to tell you I flew out here to say

that we have an economic crisis we have environmental crisis

we have a political crisis

We also have a social and relational crisis

we're in the valley

We're fragmented from each other

we've got cascades of lies coming out of Washington 

We're in the valley

And so I've spent the last five years 

how do you get out of a valley

The Greeks used to say You suffer your way to wisdom

And from that dark period where I started I've had a few realizations

The first is freedom sucks

Economic freedom is OK political freedom is great

social freedom sucks

The unrooted man is the adrift man

The unrooted man is the unremembered man because he's uncommitted to things

Freedom is not an ocean you want to swim in

it's a river you want to get across

so you can commit and plant yourself on the other side

The second thing I learned

is that when you have one of those bad moments in life

you can either be broken

or you can be broken open

And we all know people who are broken

They've endured some pain or grief they get smaller

they get angrier resentful they lash out

As the saying is

Pain that is not transformed gets transmitted

But other people are broken open

Suffering's great power is that it's an interruption of life

It reminds you you're not the person you thought you were

The theologian Paul Tillich said

what suffering does is it carves through what you thought was the floor

of the basement of your soul

and it carves through that revealing a cavity below

and it carves through that revealing a cavity below

You realize there are depths of yourself you never anticipated

and only spiritual and relational food will fill those depths

And when you get down there you get out of the head of the ego

and you get into the heart

the desiring heart

The idea that what we really yearn for is longing and love for another

the kind of thing that Louis de Bernires described in his book
Louis de Berni  res
Captain Corelli's Mandolin

He had an old guy talking to his daughter

about his relationship with his late wife

and the old guy says

Love itself is whatever is leftover when being in love is burned away

And this is both an art and a fortunate accident

Your mother and I had it

We had roots that grew towards each other underground

and when all the pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches

we discovered that we are one tree and not two

That's what the heart yearns for

The second thing you discover is your soul

Now I don't ask you to believe in God or not believe in God

but I do ask you to believe that there's a piece of you

that has no shape size color or weight

but that gives you infinite dignity and value

Rich and successful people don't have more of this

than less successful people

Slavery is wrong because it's an obliteration of another soul

Rape is not just an attack on a bunch of physical molecules

it's an attempt to insult another person's soul

And what the soul does is it yearns for righteousness

The heart yearns for fusion with another the soul yearns for righteousness

And that led to my third realization which I borrowed from Einstein

The problem you have is not going to be solved

at the level of consciousness on which you created it

You have to expand to a different level of consciousness

So what do you do

Well the first thing you do is you throw yourself on your friends

and you have deeper conversations that you ever had before

But the second thing you do

you have to go out alone into the wilderness

You go out into that place where there's nobody there to perform

and the ego has nothing to do and it crumbles

and only then are you capable of being loved

I have a friend who said that when her daughter was born

she realized that she loved her more than evolution required

Laughter

And I've always loved that

Applause

Because it talks about the peace that's at the deep of ourself

our inexplicable care for one another

And when you touch that spot you're ready to be rescued

The hard thing about when you're in the valley

is that you can't climb out

somebody has to reach in and pull you out

It happened to me

I got luckily invited over to a house by a couple named Kathy and David

and they were 

They had a kid in the DC public school his name's Santi

Santi had a friend who needed a place to stay

because his mom had some health issues

And then that kid had a friend and that kid had a friend

When I went to their house six years ago

I walk in the door there's like  around the kitchen table

a whole bunch sleeping downstairs in the basement

I reach out to introduce myself to a kid

and he says We don't really shake hands here

We just hug here

And I'm not the huggiest guy on the face of the earth

but I've been going back to that home every Thursday night when I'm in town

and just hugging all those kids

They demand intimacy

They demand that you behave in a way where you're showing all the way up

And they teach you a new way to live

which is the cure for all the ills of our culture

which is a way of direct  really putting relationship first

not just as a word but as a reality

And the beautiful thing is these communities are everywhere

I started something at the Aspen Institute called Weave The Social Fabric
Aspen InstituteWeavethe Social Fabric
This is our logo here

And we plop into a place and we find weavers anywhere everywhere

We find people like Asiaha Butler who grew up in 
Asiaha Butler
who lived in Chicago in Englewood in a tough neighborhood

And she was about to move because it was so dangerous

and she looked across the street and she saw two little girls

playing in an empty lot with broken bottles

and she turned to her husband and she said We're not leaving

We're not going to be just another family that abandon that

And she Googled volunteer in Englewood and now she runs RAGE
EnglewoodRAGE
the big community organization there

Some of these people have had tough valleys

I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio who came home from an antiquing trip

and found that her husband had killed himself and their two kids

She now runs a free pharmacy she volunteers in the community

she helps women cope with violence she teaches

She told me I grew from this experience because I was angry

I was going to fight back against what he tried to do to me

by making a difference in the world

See he didn't kill me

My response to him is

'Whatever you meant to do to me screw you you're not going to do it'

These weavers are not living an individualistic life

they're living a relationist life they have a different set of values

They have moral motivations

They have vocational certitude they have planted themselves down

I met a guy in Youngstown Ohio

who just held up a sign in the town square

Defend Youngstown

They have radical mutuality

and they are geniuses at relationship

There's a woman named Mary Gordon

who runs something called Roots of Empathy

And what they do is they take a bunch of kids an eighth grade class

they put a mom and an infant

and then the students have to guess what the infant is thinking

to teach empathy

There was one kid in a class who was bigger than the rest

because he'd been held back been through the foster care system

seen his mom get killed

And he wanted to hold the baby

And the mom was nervous because he looked big and scary

But she let this kid Darren hold the baby

He held it and he was great with it

He gave the baby back and started asking questions about parenthood

And his final question was

If nobody has ever loved you do you think you can be a good father

And so what Roots of Empathy does

is they reach down and they grab people out of the valley

And that's what weavers are doing

Some of them switch jobs

Some of them stay in their same jobs

But one thing is they have an intensity to them

I read this 

EO Wilson wrote a great book called Naturalist about his childhood
EO 
When he was seven his parents were divorcing

And they sent him to Paradise Beach in North Florida

And he'd never seen the ocean before

And he'd never seen a jellyfish before

He wrote The creature was astonishing It existed beyond my imagination

He was sitting on the dock one day

and he saw a stingray float beneath his feet

And at that moment a naturalist was born in the awe and wonder

And he makes this observation

that when you're a child

you see animals at twice the size as you do as an adult

And that has always impressed me

because what we want as kids is that moral intensity

to be totally given ourselves over to something

and to find that level of vocation

And when you are around these weavers

they see other people at twice the size as normal people

They see deeper into them

And what they see is joy

On the first mountain of our life when we're shooting for our career

we shoot for happiness

And happiness is good it's the expansion of self

You win a victory

you get a promotion your team wins the Super Bowl

you're happy

Joy is not the expansion of self it's the dissolving of self

It's the moment when the skin barrier disappears between a mother and her child

it's the moment when a naturalist feels just free in nature

It's the moment where you're so lost in your work or a cause

you have totally selfforgotten

And joy is a better thing to aim for than happiness

I collect passages of joy of people when they lose it

One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith
Zadie Smith
In  she was in a London nightclub

looking for her friends wondering where her handbag was

And suddenly as she writes

 a railthin man with enormous eyes reached across a sea of bodies

for my hand

He kept asking me the same thing over and over 'Are you feeling it'

My ridiculous heels were killing me I was terrified that I might die

yet I felt simultaneously overwhelmed with delight

that 'Can I Kick It' should happen to be playing
 
on this precise moment in the history of the world

on the sound system

and it was now morphing into 'Teen Spirit'

I took the man's hand the top of my head blew away

we danced we danced we gave ourselves up to joy

And so what I'm trying to describe is two different life mindsets

The first mountain mindset which is about individual happiness and career success

And it's a good mindset I have nothing against it

But we're in a national valley

because we don't have the other mindset to balance it

We no longer feel good about ourselves as a people

we've lost our defining faith in our future

we don't see each other deeply we don't treat each other as well

And we need a lot of changes

We need an economic change and environmental change

But we also need a cultural and relational revolution

We need to name the language of a recovered society

And to me the weavers have found that language

My theory of social change is that society changes

when a small group of people find a better way to live

and the rest of us copy them

And these weavers have found a better way to live

And you don't have to theorize about it

They are out there as community builders all around the country

We just have to shift our lives a little

so we can say I'm a weaver we're a weaver

And if we do that

the hole inside ourselves gets filled

but more important the social unity gets repaired

Thank you very much

Applause

For thousands of years well really probably millions of years

our ancestors have looked up at the sky and wondered what's up there

and they've also started to wonder

hmm could we be alone in this planet

Now I'm fortunate that I get to get paid to actually ask some of those questions

and sort of bad news for you

your tax dollars are paying me to try to answer some of those questions

But then about  years ago

I was told I mean asked

if I would start to look at the technology to help get us off planet

and so that's what I'm going to talk to you about today

So playing to the local crowd

this is what it looks like in your daytoday life in Boston

but as you start to go off planet things look very very different

So there we are hovering above the WGBH studios
WGBH
And here's a very famous picture of the Earthrise from the Moon

and you can see the Earth starting to recede

And then what I love is this picture

that was taken from the surface of Mars looking back at the Earth

Can anyone find the Earth

I'm going to help you out a little

Laughter

Yeah

The point of showing this is that when people start to go to Mars

they're not going to be able to keep calling in

and be micromanaged the way people on a space station are

They're going to have to be independent

So even though they're up there

there are going to be all sorts of things that they're going to need

just like people on Earth need things like oh transportation

life support food clothing and so on

But unlike on Earth they are also going to need oxygen

They're going to have to deal with about a third of the gravity that we have here

They're going to have to worry about habitats power heat light

and radiation protection

something that we don't actually worry about nearly as much on the Earth

because we have this beautiful atmosphere and magnetosphere

The problem with that is that we also have a lot of constraints

So the biggest one for us is upmass

and the number that I've used for years

is it costs about  dollars to launch a can of Coke into low Earth orbit

The problem is there you are with  dollars later

and you're still in low Earth orbit

You're not even at the Moon or Mars or anything else

So you're going to have to try to figure out

how to keep the mass as low as possible so you don't have to launch it

But on top of that cost issue with the mass

you also have problems of storage

and flexibility and reliability

You can't just get there and say Oops I forgot to bring

because Amazoncom just does not deliver to Mars
Amazoncom
So you better be prepared

So what is the solution for this

And I'm going to propose to you for the rest of this talk

that the solution actually is life

and when you start to look at life as a technology

you realize ah that's it

that's exactly what we needed

This plant here like every person here

and every one of your dogs and cats

and plants and so on

all started as a single cell

So imagine you're starting as a very low upmass object

and then growing into something a good deal bigger

Now my hero Charles Darwin

of course reminds us that there's no such thing as a designer in biology

but what if we now have the technology

to design biology

maybe even design oh whole new lifeforms

that can do things for us that we couldn't have imagined otherwise

So years ago I was asked to start to sell this program

and while I was doing that

I was put in front of a panel at NASA
NASA
as you might sort of imagine

a bunch of people in suits and white shirts and pencil protectors

and I did this sort of crazy wild

This is all the next great thing

and I thought they would be blown over

and instead the chairman of the committee just looked at me straight in the eye

and said So what's the big idea

So I was like OK you want Star Trek

We'll do Star Trek

And so let me tell you what the big idea is

We've used organisms to make biomaterials for years

So here's a great picture taken outside of Glasgow

and you can see lots of great biomaterials there

There are trees that you could use to build houses

There are sheep where you can get your wool from

You could get leather from the sheep

Just quickly glancing around the room I'll bet there's no one in this room

that doesn't have some kind of animal or plant product on them

some kind of biomaterial

But you know what

We're not going to take sheep and trees and stuff to Mars

That's nuts because of the upmass problem

But we are going to take things like this

This is Bacillus subtilis

Those white dots that you see are spores

This happens to be a bacterium that can form incredibly resistant spores

and when I say incredibly resistant they've proven themselves

Bacillus subtilis spores have been flown on what was called LDEF
LDEF
Long Duration Exposure Facility for almost six years

and some of them survived that in space

Unbelievable a lot better than any of us can do

So why not just take the capabilities

like to make wood or to make wool or spider silk or whatever

and put them in Bacillus subtilis spores

and take those with you off planet

So what are you going to do when you're off planet

Here's an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin looking back at the Eagle
Buzz Aldrin
when he landed oh it was almost  years ago on the surface of the Moon

Now if you're going to go to the Moon for three days

and you're the first person to set foot

yeah you can live in a tin can

but you wouldn't want to do that for say a year and a half

So I did actually a calculation being in California

I looked at what the average size of a cell at Alcatraz is

and I have news for you

the volume in the Eagle there in the Lunar Module

was about the size of a cell at Alcatraz

if it were only five feet high

So incredibly cramped living quarters

You just can't ask a human to stay in there for long periods of time

So why not take these biomaterials and make something

So here's an image that a colleague of mine

who is an architect Chris Maurer has done of what we've been proposing

and we'll get to the point

of why I've been standing up here holding something

that looks like a dried sandwich this whole lecture

So we've proposed that the solution to the habitat problem on Mars

could just simply lie in a fungus

So I'm now probably going to turn off everyone

from ever eating a mushroom again

So let's talk about fungi for a second

So you're probably familiar with this fruiting body of the fungus

That's the mushroom

But what we're interested in actually is what's beneath the surface there

the mycelium

which are these root hairlike structures

that are really the main part of the mushroom

Well it turns out you can take those 

there's a micrograph I did 

and you can put them in a mold

and give them a little food 

and it doesn't take much you can grow these things on sawdust 

so this piece here was grown on sawdust

and that mycelium then will fill that structure

to make something

We've actually tried growing mycelium on Mars Simulant

So no one's actually gone to the surface of Mars

but this is a simulated surface of Mars

and you can see those hairlike mycelia out there

It's really amazing stuff

How strong can you make these things

Well you know I could give you numbers and tests and so on

but I think that's probably the best way to describe it

There's one of my students proving that you can do this

To do this then you've got to figure out how to put it in context

How's this actually going to happen

I mean this is a great idea Lynn

but how are you going to get from here to there

So what we're saying is you grow up the mycelium in the lab for example

and then you fill up a little structure maybe a houselike structure that's tiny

that is maybe a doublebagged sort of plastic thing like an inflatable 

I sort of think LLBean when I see this
LLBean
And then you put it in a rocket ship and you send it off to Mars

Rocket lands

you release the bag

and you add a little water

and voila you've got your habitat

You know how cool would that be

And the beauty of that is you don't have to take something prebuilt

And so our estimates are that we could save  percent of the mass

that NASA is currently proposing by taking up a big steel structure
NASA
if we actually grow it on site

So let me give you another big idea

What about digital information

What's really interesting is you have a physical link to your parents

and they have a physical link to their parents and so on

all the way back to the origin of life

You have never broken that continuum

But the fact is that we can do that today

So we have students every day in our labs 

students in Boston even do this 

that make up DNA sequences
DNA
and they hit the send button

and they send them to their local DNA synthesis company
DNA
Now once you break that physical link

where you're sending it across town

it doesn't matter if you're sending it across the Charles River

or if you're sending that information to Mars

You've broken that physical link

So then once you're on Mars

or across the river or wherever

you can take that digital information

synthesize the physical DNA
DNA
put it maybe in another organism

and voila you've got new capabilities there

So again you've broken that physical link That's huge

What about chemistry

Biology does chemistry for us on Earth

and again has for literally thousands of years

I bet virtually everyone in this room has eaten something today

that has been made by biology doing chemistry

Let me give you a big hint there

What about another idea

What about using DNA itself to make a wire
DNA
Because again we're trying to miniaturize everything

DNA is really cheap
DNA
Strawberries have a gazillion amount of DNA
DNA
You know you could take a strawberry with you isolate the DNA
DNA
and one of my students has figured out a way

to take DNA and tweak it a little bit
DNA
so that you can incorporate silver atoms in very specific places

thus making an electrical wire

How cool is that

So while we're on the subject of metals

we're going to need to use metals for things like integrated circuits

Probably we're going to want it for some structures and so on

And things like integrated circuits ultimately go bad

We could talk a lot about that but I'm going to leave it at that

that they do go bad

and so where are you going to get those metals

Yeah you could try to mine them with heavy equipment

but you get that upmass problem

And I always tell people the best way to find the metals for a new cell phone

is in a dead cell phone

So what if you take biology

as the technology to get these metals out

And how do you do this

Well take a look at the back of a vitamin bottle

and you'll get an idea of all the sorts of metals

that we actually use in our bodies

So we have a lot of proteins as well as other organisms

that can actually specifically bind metals

So what if we now take those proteins

and maybe attach them to this fungal mycelium

and make a filter so we can start to pull those metals out

in a very specific way without big mining equipment

and even better we've actually got a proof of concept

where we've then taken those metals that we pulled out with proteins

and reprinted an integrated circuit using a plasma printer

Again how cool

Electricity I was asked by a head of one of the NASA centers
NASA
if you could ever take chemical energy and turn that into electrical energy

Well the great news is it's not just the electric eel that does it

Everybody in this room who is still alive and functioning

is doing that

Part of the food that you've eaten today

has gone to operate the nerve cells in your body

But even other organisms nonsentient ones

are creating electric energy

even bacteria

Some bacteria are very good at making little wires

So if we can harvest that ability

of turning chemical energy into electrical energy

again how cool would that be

So here are some of the big ideas we talked about

Let me try one more life 

So for example all of the sugars in our body are righthanded

Why shouldn't we make an organism with lefthanded sugars

Why not make an organism that can do things that no organism can do today

So organisms normally have evolved to live in very specific environments

So here's this lion cub literally up a tree

and I took a picture of him a bit later

and he was a lot happier when he was down on the ground

So organisms are designed for specific environments

But what if you can go back to that idea of synthetic biology

and tweak 'em around

So here is one of our favorite places in Yellowstone National Park

This is Octopus Springs

If you tilt your head a little bit

it sort of looks like a body and tentacles coming out

It's above the boiling temperature of water

Those organisms that you see on the edge and the colors

actually match the temperatures that are there

very very hightemperature thermophiles

So why not take organisms that can live at extremes

whether it's high temperature or low temperature

or low pH or high pH
pHpH
or high salt or high levels of radiation

and take some of those capabilities

and put it into other organisms

And this is a project that my students have called

and I love this the hell cell

And so we've done that

We've taken organisms and sort of tweaked them and pushed them to the edges

And this is important for getting us off planet

and also for understanding what life is like in the universe

So let me give you just a couple of final thoughts

First is this whole idea that we have all these needs

for human settlement off planet

that are in some ways exactly like we have on the Earth

that we need the food and we need the shelter and so on

but we have very very different constraints

of this upmass problem and the reliability and the flexibility and so on

But because we have these constraints that you don't have here

where you might have to think about the indigenous petrochemical industry

or whatever

you now have constraints that have to unleash creativity

And once you unleash this creativity because you have the new constraints

you're forcing gamechanging technological advances

that you wouldn't have gotten any other way

Finally we have to think a little bit

is it a good idea to tinker around with life

Well the sort of easy answer to that is

that probably no one in the room keeps a wolf cub at home

but you might have a puppy or a dog

you probably didn't eat teosinte this summer but you ate corn

We have been doing genetic modification with organisms

for literally  or more years

This is a different approach but to say all of a sudden

humans should never touch an organism

is kinda silly

because we have that capability now

to do things that are far more beneficial for the planet Earth

and for life beyond that

And so then the question is should we

And of course I feel that not only should we

at least for getting off Earth

but actually if we don't use synthetic biology

we will never solve this upmass problem

So once you think of life as a technology you've got the solution

And so with that I'd like to finish the way I always finish

and say ad astra which means to the stars

Thank you very much Boston

Applause

When I was a kid I was afraid of the dark

The darkness is where the monsters are

And I had this little night light outside of my bedroom

so that it would never get too dark

But over time my fear of the dark turned to curiosity

What is out there in the darkdark

And it turns out

that trying to understand the darkness is something that's fascinated humans

for thousands of years maybe forever

And we know this

because we find their ancient relics of their attempts to map the sky

This tusk is over  years old

Some people think that it's a carving of Orion

or maybe a calendar

We don't know

The Fuxi star map is over  years old

and it's from a neolithic tomb in ancient China

And that little pile of clamshells

underneath the dead guy's foot in the middle 

that's supposed to be the Big Dipper

Maybe

The Nebra disk is uncontroversial
Nebra
You don't have to be an astronomer to know that you're looking at the Moon phases

or the Sun in eclipse

And that little group of seven stars that's the Pleiades the Seven Sisters

But in any case the point is clear

astronomers have been mapping the sky for a long time

Why

It's our calling card as a species in the galaxy

to figure things out

We know our planet

we cure our diseases

we cook our food

we leave our planet

But it's not easy

Understanding the universe is battle

It is unrelenting it is timevarying

and it is one we are all in together

It is a battle in the darkness against the darkness

Which is why Orion has weapons

In any case if you're going to engage in this battle

you need to know the battlefield

So at its core

mapping the sky involves three essential elements

You've got objects that are giving off light

you've got telescopes that are collecting that light

and you've got instruments

that are helping you understand what that light is

Many of you have mapped the Moon phases over time

with your eyes your eyes being your more basic telescope

And you've understood what that means with your brains

your brains being one of your more basic instruments

Now if you and a buddy get together

you would spend over  years

you would map  stars extremely precisely

You would move the front line to the battle

And that's what Tycho Brahe and his buddy or his assistant really
Tycho Brahe
Johannes Kepler did back in the s
Johannes Kepler
And they moved the line

figured out how planets worked

how they moved around the Sun

But it wasn't until about  years ago

that we realized

it's a big universe

It seems like the universe is just infinite which it is

but the observable universe is finite

Which means we can win the battle

But if you're going to map the universe

you're not going to do it with one or two of your besties

Mapping the universe takes an army

an army of curious creative craftspeople

who working together can accomplish the extraordinary

I lead this army of creatives

in the fifth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
SDSS
And this is how astronomers have managed to shepherd individual curiosity

through its industrial age

preserving the individual ability to make discoveries

but putting into place mega machinery to truly advance the frontier

In SDSS we divide the sky into three mappers
SDSS
one for the stars one for the black holes

and one for the galaxies

My survey has two hemispheres

five telescopes or  depending on how you count

 spectrographs

and millions of objects

It's a monster

So let's go through the mappers

The Milky Way galaxy has  billion plus or minus a few hundred billion stars

That is not a number that you hold in your head

That is a number that doesn't make practical sense

to pretty much anybody

You never get  billion jelly beans in your hand You know

We're nowhere near mapping all of those stars yet

So we have to choose the most interesting ones

In SDSSV we're mapping six million stars
SDSSV
where we think we can measure their age

Because if you can measure the age of a star

that's like having six million clocks spread all throughout the Milky Way

And with that information

we can unravel the history and fossil record of our galaxy

and learn how it formed

I'm just going to cut right to the chase here

Black holes are among the most perplexing objects in the universe

Why

Because they are literally just math incarnate in a physical form

that we barely understand

It's like the number zero being animated and walking around the corridors here

That would be super weird

These are weirder

And it's not just like a basketball

that you smoosh down into a little point and it's super dense and that's weird

No smooshed basketballs have a surface

These things don't have surfaces and we know that now

Because we've seen it

Or the lack of it

What's really interesting about black holes

is that we can learn a lot about them by studying the material

just as it passes through that point of no information return

Because at that point

it's emitting lots of Xrays and optical and UV and radio waves
X
We can actually learn how these objects grow

And in SDSS we're looking at over half a million supermassive black holes
SDSS
to try to understand how they formed

Like I said

we live in the Milky Way you guys are all familiar with that

The Milky Way is a completely average galaxy

Nothing funny going on

But it's ours which is great

We think that the Milky Way and all the Milky Ways

have this really disturbing past

of literally blowing themselves apart

It's like every average guy you know

has a history as a punk rock teenager

That's very bizarre

Stars are blowing up in these systems

black holes are growing at their centers

and emitting a tremendous amount of energy

How does that happen how does this transformation happen

And at SDSS we're going to the bellies of the beast
SDSS
and zooming way in

to look at these processes where they are occurring

in order to understand how Sid Vicious grows up into Ward Cleaver
Sid ViciousWard Cleaver
My arsenal

These are my two big telescopes

The Apache Point Observatory hosts the Sloan telescope in New Mexico

and the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile

hosts the twoandahalfmeter telescope the du Pont

Two and a half meters is the size of our mirror

which was huge for Tycho and Kepler

But it's actually not so big today

There are way bigger telescopes out there

But in SDSS we use new instruments on these old telescopes
SDSS
to make them interesting

We capture light from all of those objects into our aperture

and that light is then focused at the focal plane

where our instruments sit and process that light

What's new in SDSSV
SDSSV
is that we're making the focal plane entirely robotic

That's right robots

Laughter

So I'm going to show them to you

but they're fierce and terrifying

and I want you all to just take a breath

Exhales Trigger warning

And with no apologies to all the Blade Runners among you

here they are

Laughter

I have  of these

 in the focal plane of each telescope in each hemisphere

And this is how they move on the sky

So these are our objects and a star field

so you've got stars galaxies black holes

And our robots move to those objects as we pass over them

in order to capture the light

from those stars and galaxies and black holes and yes

it is weird to capture black hole light

but we've already gone over that black holes are weird

One more thing

Stars are exploding all the time

like this one did back in  in our cosmic backyard

Black holes are growing all the time

There is a new sky every night

Which means we can't just map the sky one time

We have to map the sky multiple times

So in SDSSV we're going back to each part of the sky multiple times
SDSSV
in order to see how these objects change over time

Because those changes in time encode the physics

and they encode how these objects are growing and changing

Mow the sky

OK let me just recap

Global survey two hemispheres

five telescopes  spectrographs millions of objects mow the sky

creative army robots yeah

So you're thinking Wow

She must have this industrial machine going

no room for the individual curious lone wolf genius right

And you'd be  percent wrong

Meet Hanny's Voorwerp

Hanny van Arkel was a Dutch schoolteacher

who was analyzing the public versions of the SDSS data
SDSS
when she found this incredibly rare type of object

which is now a subject of major study

She was able to do this

because SDSS since its beginning and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation
SDSS
has made its data both publicly available

and usable to a broad range of audiences

She's a citizen  yeah clap for that

Clap for that

Applause

Hanny is a citizen scientist

or as I like to call them

citizen warriors

And she shows that you don't have to be a fancy astrophysicist to participate

You just have to be curious

A few years ago

my fouryearold asked Can moons have moons

And I set about to answer this question

because even though many fouryearolds over all of time

have probably asked this question

many experts including myself didn't know the answer

These are the moons in our solar system that can host hypothetical submoons

And that just goes to show you that there are so many basic questions

left to be understood

And this brings me to the most important point about SDSS
SDSS
Because yeah the stars the galaxies the black holes the robots 

that's all super cool

But the coolest thing of all

is that eensyweensy creatures on a rubble pile

around a totally average star in a totally average galaxy

can win the battle to understand their world

Every dot in this video is a galaxy

Every dot

Cheers Applause

I'm showing here the number of galaxies

that astronomers have mapped in large surveys since about 

You can see SDSS kick in around YK
SDSS
If we stay on this line

we will map every large galaxy in the observable universe by 

Think about that

Think about it we've gone from arranging clamshells

to general relativity to SDSS in a few thousand years 
SDSS
and if we hang on  more

we can map all the galaxies

But we have to stay on the line

Will that be our choice

There are dark forces in this world

that will rob our entire species of our right to understand our universe

Don't be afraid of the dark

Fight back

Join us

Thank you

Applause

It may seem like we're all standing on solid earth right now

but we're not

The rocks and the dirt underneath us are crisscrossed by tiny little fractures

and empty spaces

And these empty spaces are filled with astronomical quantities of microbes

such as these ones

The deepest that we found microbes so far into the earth

is five kilometers down

So like if you pointed yourself at the ground

and took off running into the ground

you could run an entire K race and microbes would line your whole path
K
So you may not have ever thought about these microbes

that are deep inside earth's crust

but you probably thought about the microbes living in our guts

If you add up the gut microbiomes

of all the people and all the animals on the planet

collectively this weighs about  tons

This is a huge biome that we carry in our bellies every single day

We should all be proud

Laughter

But it pales in comparison to the number of microbes

that are covering the entire surface of the earth

like in our soils our rivers and our oceans

Collectively these weigh about two billion tons

But it turns out that the majority of microbes on earth

aren't even in oceans or our guts or sewage treatment plants

Most of them are actually inside the earth's crust

So collectively these weigh  billion tons

This is one of the biggest biomes on the planet

and we didn't even know it existed until a few decades ago

So the possibilities for what life is like down there

or what it might do for humans

are limitless

This is a map showing a red dot

for every place where we've gotten pretty good deep subsurface samples

with modern microbiological methods

and you may be impressed

that we're getting a pretty good global coverage

but actually if you remember that these are the only places

that we have samples from it looks a little worse

If we were all in an alien spaceship

trying to reconstruct a map of the globe from only these samples

we'd never be able to do it

So people sometimes say to me

Yeah there's a lot of microbes in the subsurface but 

aren't they just kind of dormant

This is a good point

Relative to a ficus plant or the measles or my kid's guinea pigs

these microbes probably aren't doing much of anything at all

We know that they have to be slow because there's so many of them

If they all started dividing at the rate of E coli

then they would double the entire weight of the earth rocks included

over a single night

In fact many of them probably haven't even undergone a single cell division

since the time of ancient Egypt

Which is just crazy

Like how do you wrap your head around things that are so longlived

But I thought of an analogy that I really love

but it's weird and it's complicated

So I hope that you can all go there with me

Alright let's try it

It's like trying to figure out the life cycle of a tree 

if you only lived for a day

So like if human life span was only a day and we lived in winter

then you would go your entire life

without ever seeing a tree with a leaf on it

And there would be so many human generations

that would pass by within a single winter

that you may not even have access to a history book

that says anything other than the fact that trees are always lifeless sticks

that don't do anything

Of course this is ridiculous

We know that trees are just waiting for summer

so they can reactivate

But if the human life span

were significantly shorter than that of trees

we might be completely oblivious to this totally mundane fact

So when we say that these deep subsurface microbes are just dormant

are we like people who die after a day trying to figure out how trees work

What if these deep subsurface organisms

are just waiting for their version of summer

but our lives are too short for us to see it

If you take E coli and seal it up in a test tube

with no food or nutrients

and leave it there for months to years

most of the cells die off of course because they're starving

But a few of the cells survive

If you take these old surviving cells

and compete them also under starvation conditions

against a new fastgrowing culture of E coli

the grizzled old tough guys beat out the squeaky clean upstarts

every single time

So this is evidence there's actually an evolutionary payoff

to being extraordinarily slow

So it's possible

that maybe we should not equate being slow with being unimportant

Maybe these outofsight outofmind microbes

could actually be helpful to humanity

OK so as far as we know

there are two ways to do subsurface living

The first is to wait for food to trickle down from the surface world

like trying to eat the leftovers of a picnic that happened  years ago

Which is a crazy way to live

but shockingly seems to work out for a lot of microbes in earth

The other possibility is for a microbe to just say

Nah I don't need the surface world

I'm good down here

For microbes that go this route

they have to get everything that they need in order to survive

from inside the earth

Some things are actually easier for them to get

They're more abundant inside the earth

like water or nutrients like nitrogen and iron and phosphorus

or places to live

These are things that we literally kill each other to get ahold of

up at the surface world

But in the subsurface the problem is finding enough energy

Up at the surface

plants can chemically knit together carbon dioxide molecules into yummy sugars

as fast as the sun's photons hit their leaves

But in the subsurface of course there's no sunlight

so this ecosystem has to solve the problem

of who is going to make the food for everybody else

The subsurface needs something that's like a plant

but it breathes rocks

Luckily such a thing exists

and it's called a chemolithoautotroph

Laughter

Which is a microbe that uses chemicals  chemo

from rocks  litho

to make food  autotroph

And they can do this with a ton of different elements

They can do this with sulphur iron manganese nitrogen carbon

some of them can use pure electrons straight up

Like if you cut the end off of an electrical cord

they could breathe it like a snorkel

Laughter

These chemolithoautotrophs

take the energy that they get from these processes

and use it to make food like plants do

But we know that plants do more than just make food

They also make a waste product oxygen

which we are  percent dependent upon

But the waste product that these chemolithoautotrophs make

is often in the form of minerals

like rust or pyrite like fool's gold

or carminites like limestone

So what we have are microbes that are really really slow like rocks

that get their energy from rocks

that make as their waste product other rocks

So am I talking about biology or am I talking about geology

This stuff really blurs the lines

Laughter

So if I'm going to do this thing

and I'm going to be a biologist who studies microbes

that kind of act like rocks

then I should probably start studying geology

And what's the coolest part of geology

Volcanoes

Laughter

This is looking inside the crater of Pos Volcano in Costa Rica

Many volcanoes on earth arise because an oceanic tectonic plate

crashes into a continental plate

As this oceanic plate subducts

or gets moved underneath this continental plate

things like water and carbon dioxide and other materials

get squeezed out of it

like ringing a wet washcloth

So in this way subduction zones are like portals into the deep earth

where materials are exchanged between the surface and the subsurface world

So I was recently invited by some of my colleagues in Costa Rica

to come and work with them on some of the volcanoes

And of course I said yes because I mean Costa Rica is beautiful

but also because it sits on top of one of these subduction zones

We wanted to ask the very specific question

Why is it that the carbon dioxide

that comes out of this deeply buried oceanic tectonic plate

is only coming out of the volcanoes

Why don't we see it distributed throughout the entire subduction zone

Do the microbes have something to do with that

So this is a picture of me inside Pos Volcano

along with my colleague Donato Giovannelli
Donato Giovannelli
That lake that we're standing next to is made of pure battery acid

I know this because we were measuring the pH when this picture was taken
pH
And at some point while we were working inside the crater

I turned to my Costa Rican colleague Carlos Ramrez and I said
Carlos Ram  rez
Alright if this thing starts erupting right now

what's our exit strategy

And he said Oh yeah great question it's totally easy

Just turn around and enjoy the view

Laughter

Because it will be your last

Laughter

And it may sound like he was being overly dramatic

but  days after I was standing next to that lake

this happened

Audience Oh

Freaking terrifying right

Laughs

This was the biggest eruption this volcano had had in someodd years

and not long after this video ends

the camera that was taking the video is obliterated

and the entire lake that we had been sampling

vaporizes completely

But I also want to be clear

that we were pretty sure this was not going to happen

on the day that we were actually in the volcano

because Costa Rica monitors its volcanoes very carefully

through the OVSICORI Institute
OVSICORI
and we had scientists from that institute with us on that day

But the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly

that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas

is coming out of this oceanic plate

then you should look no further than the volcanoes themselves

But if you go to Costa Rica

you may notice that in addition to these volcanoes

there are tons of cozy little hot springs all over the place

Some of the water in these hot springs is actually bubbling up

from this deeply buried oceanic plate

And our hypothesis was that there should be carbon dioxide

bubbling up with it

but something deep underground was filtering it out

So we spent two weeks driving all around Costa Rica

sampling every hot spring we could find 

it was awful let me tell you

And then we spent the next two years measuring and analyzing data

And if you're not a scientist I'll just let you know that the big discoveries

don't really happen when you're at a beautiful hot spring

or on a public stage

they happen when you're hunched over a messy computer

or you're troubleshooting a difficult instrument

or you're Skyping your colleagues

because you are completely confused about your data

Scientific discoveries kind of like deep subsurface microbes

can be very very slow

But in our case this really paid off this one time

We discovered that literally tons of carbon dioxide

were coming out of this deeply buried oceanic plate

And the thing that was keeping them underground

and keeping it from being released out into the atmosphere

was that deep underground

underneath all the adorable sloths and toucans of Costa Rica

were chemolithoautotrophs

These microbes and the chemical processes that were happening around them

were converting this carbon dioxide into carbonate mineral

and locking it up underground

Which makes you wonder

If these subsurface processes are so good at sucking up

all the carbon dioxide coming from below them

could they also help us with a little carbon problem

we've got going on up at the surface

Humans are releasing enough carbon dioxide into our atmosphere

that we are decreasing the ability of our planet

to support life as we know it

And scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs

are working on methods to pull carbon dioxide

out of these point sources

so that they're not released into the atmosphere

And they need to put it somewhere

So for this reason

we need to keep studying places where this carbon might be stored

possibly in the subsurface

to know what's going to happen to it when it goes there

Will these deep subsurface microbes be a problem because they're too slow

to actually keep anything down there

Or will they be helpful

because they'll help convert this stuff to solid carbonate minerals

If we can make such a big breakthrough

just from one study that we did in Costa Rica

then imagine what else is waiting to be discovered down there

This new field of geobiochemistry or deep subsurface biology

or whatever you want to call it

is going to have huge implications

not just for mitigating climate change

but possibly for understanding how life and earth have coevolved

or finding new products that are useful for industrial or medical applications

Maybe even predicting earthquakes

or finding life outside our planet

It could even help us understand the origin of life itself

Fortunately I don't have to do this by myself

I have amazing colleagues all over the world

who are cracking into the mysteries of this deep subsurface world

And it may seem like life buried deep within the earth's crust

is so far away from our daily experiences that it's kind of irrelevant

But the truth is that this weird slow life

may actually have the answers to some of the greatest mysteries

of life on earth

Thank you

Applause

My name is Jon Gray
  
They call me The Dishwasher

I cofounded Ghetto Gastro

a Bronxbased collective

that works at the intersection of food design and art

We create experiences that challenge people's perceptions of the Bronx

the place that I call home

It's a funny thing

I just touched down in Vancouver from Paris a few days ago

We took over the Place Vendme with the Bronx Brasserie

Oui oui chrie

Laughter

It's wild because in Paris they have this saying

le Bronx
Le Bronx
which means something is in disarray or a problem

That's the Place Vendme

We shut it down one time

Laughter

This lingo came into play when the Bronx was burning

and movies like The Warriors and Fort Apache

still make an impression

Some may disagree

but I believe the Bronx was designed to fail

The power broker was a joker

Robert Moses instead of parting the Red Sea

he parted the Bronx with a sixlane highway

and redlined my community

My greatgrandparents had a home on Featherbed Lane

and contrary to the name

they couldn't get a good night's rest

due to the constant blasting and drilling that was necessary

to build the crossBronx expressway

a block away

I consider these policy decisions

design crimes

Applause

Being the resilient people that we are uptown

out of the systematic oppression

hiphop culture rose from the rubble and the ashes like a phoenix

Hiphop is now a trilliondollar industry

but this economic activity doesn't make it back to the Bronx

or communities like it

Let's take it back to 

I was born in the heart of the AIDS crisis

the crack epidemic

and the War on Drugs

The only thing that trickled down from Reaganomics was ghettonomics

pain prison and poverty

I was raised by brilliant beautiful and accomplished black women

Even so my pops wasn't in the picture

and I couldn't resist the allure of the streets

Like Biggie said

you're either slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot

Don't get it twisted my jumper was wet

Laughter

My shit was wet

Applause

But when I turned  I started selling weed

I didn't finish high school

the New York Board of Education banned me from all of those

but I did graduate to selling cocaine when I turned 

I did well

That was until I got jammed up caught a case when I was 

I was facing  years

I posted bail signed up at the Fashion Institute

I applied the skills that I learned in the streets

to start my own fashion brand

My lawyer peeked my ambition

so he suggested that the judge grant me a suspended sentence

For once in my life a suspension was a good thing

Laughter

Over the course of two years and many court dates

my case got dismissed

Both of my brothers have done jail time

so escaping the clutches of the prison industrial system

didn't seem realistic to me

Right now one of my brothers is facing  years

My mother put in great effort in taking me out to eat

making sure we visited museums

and traveled abroad

basically exposing me to as much culture as she could

I remembered how as a kid

I used to take over the dinner table and order food for everybody

Breaking bread has always allowed me to break the mold

and connect with people

Me and my homie Les

we grew up on the same block in the Bronx

two street dudes

He happened to be a chef

We always discussed the possibility of doing something in the food game

for the benefit of our neighborhood

Les had just won the food show Chopped

Our homie Malcolm was gearing up to run a pastry kitchen at Noma

yeah world's best Noma in Copenhagen you know the vibes

My man P had just finished training in IIItaly
PII
Milano to be exact

We decided the world needed some Bronx steasoning on it

so we mobbed up and formed Ghetto Gastro

Applause

While I'm aware our name makes a lot of people uncomfortable

for us ghetto means home

Similar to the way someone in Mumbai or Nairobi

might use the word slum

it's to locate our people

and to indict the systems of neglect that created these conditions

Applause

So what is Ghetto Gastro

Ultimately it's a movement and a philosophy

We view the work we do as gastrodiplomacy

using food and finesse

to open borders and connect culture

Last year in Tokyo

we did a Caribbean patty

we do jerk wagyu beef

shio kombu

We remixed the Bronx classic with the Japanese elements

And for Kwanzaa

we had to pay homage to our Puerto Ricans

and we did a coconut charcoal cognac coquito Dmelo

Laughter

This here is our Black Power waffle

with some gold leaf syrup

Make sure you don't slip on the drip

Laughter

Here we got the  Brix plantbased velato
velato
Strawberry fields you know the deal

Compressed watermelon

basil seeds

a little bit of strawberries up there

Back to the Bronx Brasserie

you know we had to hit them in the head with that caviar and cornbread

Laughter

Applause

We also practice durag diplomacy

Laughter

Because we don't edit who we are when we do our thing

Due to our appearance

we often get mistaken for rappers or athletes

It happened here last year at TED
TED
This dude ran down on me

and asked me when I was going to perform

How about now

Applause

So you see

we've been bringing the Bronx to the world

but now we focus on bringing the world to the Bronx

We just opened our spot

an idea kitchen

where we make and design products

create content 

Music

and host community events

The intention is to build financial capital

and creative capital in our hood

We're also collaborating with worldrenowned chef

Massimo Bottura
  
on a refettorio in the Bronx

A refettorio is a designfocused soup kitchen and community center

You see the vibes

Applause

The recent outpouring of grief about the murder

of rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle
Nipsey hussle
is largely due to the fact that he decided to stay and evolve in place

rather than leave his hood

After his death some may see this decision as foolish

but I'm making that same decision every day

to live in the Bronx

to create in the Bronx

to invest in the Bronx

Applause

At Ghetto Gastro we don't run from the word ghetto
Ghetto Gastro
and we don't run from the ghetto

Because at the end of the day

Ghetto Gastro is about showing you what we already know
Gastro
the hood

is good

Applause

Thank you

Applause

So I know for sure there's at least one thing I have in common with dentists

I absolutely hate the holiday of Halloween

Now this hatred stems not from a dislike of cavities

nor was it a lifetime in the making

Rather this hatred stems from a particular incident

that happened nine years ago

Nine years ago I was even younger I was  years old

and I was an intern in the White House

The other White House

And my job was to work with mayors and councilors nationwide

November   began just like any other day

I turned on the computer went on Google and prepared to write my news clips

I was met with a call from my mother which isn't that out the norm

my mom likes to text call email Facebook Instagram all that
FacebookInstagram
So I answered the phone expecting to hear maybe some church gossip

or maybe something from WorldStarHipHop she had discovered
WorldStarHippHop
But when I answered the phone

I was met with a tone that was unlike anything I had ever heard from my mother

My mother's loud

But she spoke in a hush still muffled tone

that conveyed a sense of sadness

And as she whispered she said Michael

your cousin Donnell was murdered last night

on Halloween

at a house party in Stockton

And like far too many people in this country

particularly from communities like mine

particularly that look like me

I spent the better part of the year dealing with anger rage nihilism

and I had a choice to make

The choice was one between action and apathy

The choice was what could I do to put purpose to this pain

I spent a year dealing with feelings of survivor's guilt

What was the point of me being at Stanford

what was the point of me being at the White House

if I was powerless to help my own family

And my own family was dying quite literally

I then began to feel a little selfish and say

what's the point of even trying to make the world a better place

Maybe that's just the way it is

Maybe I would be smart to take advantage of all the opportunities given to me

and make as much money as possible

so I'm comfortable and my immediate family is comfortable

But finally towards the end of that year

I realized I wanted to do something

So I made the crazy decision as a senior in college

to run for city council

That decision was unlikely for a couple of reasons

and not just my age

You see my family is far from a political dynasty

More men in my family have been incarcerated than in college

In fact as I speak today my father is still incarcerated

My mother she had me as a teenager

and government wasn't something we had warm feelings from

You see it was the government

that redlined the neighborhoods I grew up in

Full of liquor stores and no grocery stores

there was a lack of opportunity and concentrated poverty

It was the government and the politicians

that made choices

like the war on drugs and three strikes

that have incarcerated far too many people in our country

It was the government and political actors

that made the decisions that created the school funding formulas

that made it so the school I went to receive less per pupil spending

than schools in more affluent areas

So there was nothing about that background that made it likely for me to choose

to be involved in being a government actor

And at the same time Stockton was a very unlikely place

Stockton is my home town a city of  people

But historically it's been a place people run from rather than come back to

It's a city that's incredibly diverse

Thirtyfive percent Latino  percent white

 percent Asian  percent African American

the oldest Sikh temple in North America

But at the time I ran for office

we were also the largest city in the country at that time

to declare bankruptcy

At the time I decided to run for office

we also had more murders per capita than Chicago

At the time I decided to run for office

we had a  percent poverty rate

a  percent college attainment rate

and a host of challenges and issues beyond the scope of any yearold

So after I won my election

I did what I usually do when I feel overwhelmed

I realized the problems of Stockton were far bigger than me

and that I might need a little divine intervention

So as I prepared for my first council meeting

I went back to some wisdom my grandmother taught me

A parable I think we all know

that really constitutes the governing frame we're using

to reinvent Stockton today

I remember in Sunday school my grandmother told me

that at one time a guy asked Jesus Who was my neighbor

Who was my fellow citizen

Who am I responsible for

And instead of a short answer Jesus replied with a parable

He said there was a man on a journey

walking down Jericho Road

As he was walking down the road

he was beat up left on the side of the road

stripped of all his clothes

had everything stolen from and left to die

And then a priest came by saw the man on the side of the road

maybe said a silent prayer

hopes and prayers prayers that he gets better

Maybe saw the man on the side of the road

and surmised that it was ordained by God

for this particular man this particular group

to be on the side of the road there's nothing I can do to change it

After the priest walked by maybe a politician walked by

A yearold politician for example

Saw the man on the side of the road and saw how beat up the man was

saw that the man was a victim of violence or fleeing violence

And the politician decided You know what

Instead of welcoming this man in let's build a wall

Maybe the politician said

Maybe this man chose to be on the side of the road

That if he just pulled himself up by his bootstraps

despite his boots being stolen

and got himself back on the horse

he could be successful and there's nothing I could do

And then finally my grandmother said a good Samaritan came by

saw the man on the side of the road

and looked and saw not centuries of hatred

between Jews and Samaritans

looked and saw not his fears reflected

not economic anxiety

not what's going to happen to me because things are changing

But looked and saw a reflection of himself

He saw his neighbor he saw his common humanity

He didn't just see it he did something about it

my grandmother said

He got down on one knee

he made sure the man was OK

and I heard even gave him a room at that nice Fairmont

the Pan Pacific one

Laughter

And as I prepared to govern

I realized that given the diversity of Stockton

the first step to making change will be to again answer the same question

Who is our neighbor

And realizing that our destiny as a city was tied up in everyone

Particularly those who are left on the side of the road

But then I realized that charity isn't justice

that acts of empathy isn't justice

that being a good neighbor is necessary but not sufficient

and there was more that had to be done

So looking at the story

I realized that the road Jericho Road has a nickname

It's known as the Bloody Pass the Ascent of Red

because the road is structured for violence

This Jericho Road is narrow it's conducive for ambushing

Meaning a man on the side of the road wasn't abnormal

Wasn't strange

And in fact it was something that was structured to happen

it was supposed to happen

And Johan Galtung a peace theorist

talks about structural violence in our society

He says Structural violence is the avoidable impairment

of basic human needs

Dr Paul Farmer talks about structural violence

and talks about how it's the way

our institutions our policies our culture

creates outcomes that advantage some people and disadvantage others

And then I realized much like the road in Jericho

in many ways Stockton our society

has been structured for the outcomes we complain about

That we should not be surprised

when we see that kids in poverty don't do well in school

that we should not be surprised to see wealth gaps by race and ethnicity

We should not be surprised to see income pay disparities between genders

because that's what our society historically has been structured to do

and it's working accordingly

Applause

So taking this wisdom

I rolled up my sleeves and began to work

And there's three quick stories I want to share

that point to not that we figured everything out

not that we have arrived

but we're trending in the right direction

The first story about the neighbor

When I was a city council member

I was working with one of the most conservative members in our community

on opening a health clinic for undocumented people

in the south part of the city and I loved it

And as we opened the clinic

we had a resolution to sign

he presented me a gift

It was an O'Reilly Factor lifetime membership pin
O'Reilly Factor
Laughter

Mind you I didn't ask what he did to get such a gift

What blood oath  I had no idea how he got it

But I looked at him and I said

Well how are we working together to open a health clinic

to provide free health care for undocumented people

and you're an O'Reilly Factor member
O'Reilly Factor
He looked at me and said

Councilman Tubbs this is for my neighbors

And he's a great example of what it means

to be a good neighbor at least in that instance

The robbers

So after four years on city council I decided to run for mayor

realizing that being a parttime councilman wasn't enough

to enact the structural changes we need to see in Stockton

and I came to that conclusion by looking at the data

So my old council district where I grew up

is  minutes away from a more affluent district

And  minutes away in the same city

the difference between zip code  and 

in life expectancy is  years

Ten minutes away  miles

 years life expectancy difference

and not because of the choices people are making

Because no one chose to live in an unsafe community

where they can't exercise

No one chose to put more liquor stores than grocery stores in the community

No one chose these things but that's the reality

I realized as a councilman

to enact a structural change I wanted to see

where between the same zip codes

there's a  percent difference in the rate of unemployment

there's a  dollars a year difference in income

that being a councilman was not going to cut it

So that's when I decided to run for mayor

And as mayor we've been focused on the robbers and the road

So in Stockton as I mentioned

we have historically had problems with violent crime

In fact that's why I decided to run for office in the first place

And my first job as mayor was helping our community

to see ourselves our neighbors

not just in the people victimized by violence

but also in the perpetrators

We realized that those who enact pain in our society

those who are committing homicides and contributing to gun violence

are oftentimes victims themselves

They have high rates of trauma they have been shot at

they've known people who have been shot

That doesn't excuse their behavior but it helps explain it

and as a community we have to see these folks as us too

That they too are our neighbors

So for the past three years 

Applause

So for the past three years we've been working on two strategies

Ceasefire and Advance Peace

where we give these guys as much attention as much love

from social services from opportunities from tattoo removals

in some cases even cash

as a gift from law enforcement

And last year we saw a  percent reduction in homicides

and a  percent reduction in violent crime

Applause

And now the road

I mentioned that my community has a  percent poverty rate

As someone who comes from poverty it's a personal issue for me

So I decided that we wouldn't just do a program

or we wouldn't just do something to go around the edges

but we would call into question the very structure

that produces poverty in the first place

So starting in February we launched a basic income demonstration

where for the next  months

as a pilot  families randomly selected

who live in zip codes at or below the median income of the city

are given  dollars a month

And we're doing this for a couple of reasons

We're doing it because we realize

that something is structurally wrong in America

when one in two Americans can't afford one dollar emergency

We're doing it because we realize that something is structurally wrong

when wages have only increased six percent between  and 

We're doing it because we realize something is structurally wrong

when people working two and three jobs

doing all the jobs no one in here wants to do

can't pay for necessities like rent

like lights like health care like childcare

Applause

So I would say Stockton again we have real issues

I have constituent emails in my phone now about the homelessness issue

about some of the violent crime we're still experiencing

But I would say I think as a society we would be wise to go back

to those old Bible stories we were taught growing up

and understand that number one

we have to begin to see each other as neighbors

that when we see someone different from us

they should not reflect our fears our anxieties our insecurities

the prejudices we've been taught our biases  but we should see ourselves

We should see our common humanity

Because I think once we do that

we can do the more important work of restructuring the road

Because again I understand some listening are saying

Well Mayor Tubbs you're talking about structural violence and structural this

but you're on the stage

That the structures can't be too bad if you could come up from poverty

have a father in jail go to Stanford

work in the White House and become mayor

And I would respond by saying the term for that is exceptionalism

Meaning that we recognize it's exceptional for people to escape the structures

Meaning by our very language

we understand that the things we're seeing in our world are by design

And I think that task for us as TEDsters
TED
and as good people just people moral people

is really do the hard work necessary of not just joining hands as neighbors

but using our hands to restructure our road

a road that in this country has been rooted in things like white supremacy

A road like in this country has been rooted in things like misogyny

A road that's not working for far too many people

And I think today tomorrow and  we have a chance to change that

So as I prepare to close

I started with a story from nine years ago and I'll end with one

So after my cousin was murdered

I was lucky enough to go on the Freedom Rides

with some of the original freedom riders

And they taught me a lot about restructuring the road

And one guy in particular Bob Singleton asked me a question

I'm going to leave with us today

We were going to Anniston Alabama and he said Michael

and I said Yes sir

He said I was arrested on August  

Now why is that day important

And I said Well you were arrested

if you weren't arrested we wouldn't be on this bus

if we weren't on this bus we wouldn't have the rights we enjoy

He rolled his eyes and said No son

He said On that day Barack Obama was born

And then he said he had no idea that the choice he made

to restructure the road

would pave the way

so a child born as a second class citizen

who wouldn't be able to even get a cup of water at a counter

would have the chance  years later to be president

Then he looked at me and he said

What are you prepared to do today

so that  years from now

a child born has a chance to be president

And I think TED that's the question before us today
TED
We know things are jacked up

I think what we've seen recently isn't abnormal

but a reflection of a system that's been structured

to produce such crazy outcomes

But I think it's also an opportunity

Because these structures we inherit aren't acts of God

but acts of men and women they're policy choices

they're by politicians like me approved by voters like you

And we have the chance and the awesome opportunity

to do something about it

So my question is What are we prepared to do today

so that a child born today  years from now

isn't born in a society rooted in white supremacy

isn't born into a society riddled with misogyny

isn't born into a society riddled with homophobia and transphobia

and antiSemitism and Islamophobia and ableism

and all the phobias and isms

What are we prepared to do today

so that  years from now

we have a road in our society that's structured

to reflect what we hold to be selfevident

That all men that all women

that even all trans people

are created equal

and are endowed by your Creator with certain unalienable rights

including life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

Thank you

So on the surface

Troy is the kind of millennial that think pieces are made of

He's arrogant selfcentered

and convinced that he is smarter than people give him credit for

His favorite topics of conversation are girls sneakers and cars 

not a surprise for someone who was a teenager just a few years ago

But Troy's mannerisms 

they reveal the patterns of someone who is scared

troubled and unsure of the future

Now Troy also embodies the many positive qualities

his generation is known for

An entrepreneurial spirit

an independent streak

and a dedication to his parents

He believes in hard work

and has tried gigs in both the licit and underground economies

but he hasn't had any luck

and is just trying to find his way

and still dances between both worlds

When I met Troy a few years ago

he had been employed as a golf caddy at a local country club

carrying bags for rich men and women

who often never even acknowledged his existence

Before that he sold sneakers on Facebook
Facebook
He even tried selling candy bars and water bottles

but he wasn't making enough money to help his parents out

or save up for a car any time soon

So Troy saw how hard his immigrant mother from Jamaica worked

and how little she got back in return

and he vowed 

Troy vowed to take a different path

So he ended up selling drugs

And then he got caught

and right now he's trying to figure out his next steps

In a country where money equals power

quick money at least for a while gives young men and women like him

a sense of control over their lives

though he said he mainly did it because he wanted stability

I wanted a good life he told me

I got greedy and I got caught

Yet the amazing thing about Troy

is that he still believes in the American dream

He still believes that with hard work

despite being arrested

that he can move on up

Now I don't know if Troy's dreams came true

He disappeared from the program for troubled youth that he was involved in

and slipped through the cracks

but on that day that we spoke

I could tell that more than anything

Troy was happy that someone listened to his dreams

and asked him about his future

So I think about Troy and his optimism

when I think of the reality that so many young black millennials face

when it comes to realizing their dreams

I think about all the challenges

that so many black millennials have to endure

in a world that tells them they can anything they want to be

if they work hard

but actually doesn't sit down to listen to their dreams

or hear stories about their struggle

And we really need to listen to this generation

if we hope to have a healthy and civil society going forward

because millienials of color

they make up a fair chunk of the US and the world population

Now when we talk about millennials

a group that is often labeled as entitled lazy overeducated

noncommittal and narcissistic

the conversations often swirl around avocado toast

overpriced lattes and fancy jobs abroad 

you probably have heard all these things before

But millennials are not a monolith

Actress Lena Dunham may be the media's representation

of this generation

but Troy and other voices like his are also part of the story

In fact millennials are the largest and most diverse adult population

in this country

 percent of all American millennials are nonwhite

but often you wouldn't even know it at all

Now sure there are similarities within this population

born between  and 

Perhaps many of us do love avocado toast and lattes 

I know I do right

But there are also extreme differences

often between millennials of color and white millennials

In fact all too often

it seems as though we're virtually living in different worlds

Now black millennials

a group that I have researched for a book I recently wrote

are the perfect example of the blind spot that we have

when it comes to this group

For example

we have lower rates of homeownership

we have higher student debt

we get ID'd more at voter registration booths

we are incarcerated at higher rates 

we make less money

we have higher numbers of unemployment 

even when we do go to college I should say 

and we get married at lower rates

And honestly that's really just the beginning

Now none of these struggles are particularly new right

Young black people in America have been fighting

really fighting hard to get their stories told for centuries

After the Civil War in the s

Reconstruction failed to deliver the equality

that the end of slavery should have heralded

so young people moved to the North and the West

to escape discriminatory Jim Crow policies

Then as segregation raged in much of the country

young black people helped spearhead civil rights campaigns

in the s and s

After that some people embraced black power and then became Black Panthers

and then the next generation

they turned to hiphop to make sure their voices were heard

And then Barack Obama

hopeful that he too may bring about change

And when that failed

when we realized we were still brutalized and battered

we had to let the world know that our lives still mattered

Now when technology allows more video of our pain and struggle

to be broadcast to the world

we wonder like what is next

Our country feels more polarized than ever

yet we are still being told to pull up our pants

be respectable be less angry

smile more and work harder

Even the attitudes of millennials themselves are overdue for an update

Research done by the Washington Post in  about this supposedly woke group
Washington Post
found that  percent of white millennials think that blacks are lazier than whites

and  percent say they're not as intelligent

These are like surprising things to me and shocking

And these responses are not that much different

than generations in the past

and it shows that unfortunately

this generation is repeating the same old stereotypes

and tropes of the past

Now a study conducted by David Binder Research and MTV in  
David Binder ResearchMTV
it found that  percent of young millennials were taught by their families

that everyone should be equal

This is a really great thing a really positive step

But only  percent in that group

actually talked about race with their families

So I could understand why things may be confusing to some

There are definitely black millennials who are succeeding

Marvel's Black Panther

directed by black millennial Ryan Coogler and showcasing many others
Ryan Coogler
broke all sorts of records

There's a crop of television shows by creatives like Donald Glover

Lena Waithe and Issa Rae
Lena WaitheIssa Rae
Beyonc is like the queen right

She is like everything

Young black authors are winning awards

Serena Williams is still dominating on the tennis court

despite all her haters

and there's a crop of new politicians and activists running for office

So I don't want to like kill these moments of black joy

that I too revel in

but I want to make it clear

that these wins are too few and far between

for a people that's been here for over  years

Like that's insane right

And most people still don't really understand the full picture right

Our stories are still misunderstood

our bodies are still taken advantage of

and our voices

Our voices are silenced

in a world that still shows little concern for our everyday struggles

So our stories need to be told

in a multitude of ways

by a range of voices

talking about diverse and nuanced topics

and they really need to be listened to

And it is not just here in America right

It's all around the world

Millennials make up  percent of the world's population

That's around two billion people

And with countries like India China Indonesia and Brazil

along with the United States

accounting for  percent of the world's millennials

it's clear that the white often male heterosexual narrative of the millennial

is only telling half the story

Now there's many people trying to broaden the palette

They're fighting to get their stories told and bust the millennial stereotype

Whether it's students in South Africa protesting statues of Cecil Rhodes

Michaela Coel making us laugh from the UK
Michaela Coel
or Uche Eze who's framing views about Nigerian life online
Uche Eze
But I want to make it clear 

I want to make it really clear to everyone

that just because things look more equal than they did

in the th century

doesn't mean that things are equitable at all

It doesn't mean our experiences are equitable

and it certainly doesn't mean that a postracial society

that thing that we talked about so much

ever became close to being a reality

I think of Joelle

a middleclass something who did everything the right way

but she couldn't go to her dream school because it was simply too expensive

Or Jalessa

who knows she can't be mediocre at her job

the same way that her white peers can

Or Trina who knows that people judge her unconventional family choices

in a different way than if she were a white woman

Or actor AB
AB
who knows that the roles he takes and gets in Hollywood are different

because of his skin color

And then there's Simon

So Simon by all means would be an example of someone who's made it

He's a CFO at a tech company in San Francisco

he has a degree from MIT

and he's worked at some of the hottest tech companies in the world

But when I asked Simon if he had achieved the American dream

it took him a while to respond

While acknowledging that he had a really comfortable life

he admitted that under different circumstances

he might have chosen a different path

Simon really loves photography

but that was never a real option for him

My parents weren't able to subsidize me

through that sort of thing Simon said

Maybe that's something my children could do

So it's these kinds of stories 

the quieter more subtle ones 

that reveal the often unique and untold stories of black millennials

that show how even dreaming may differ between communities

So we really need to listen and hear the stories of this generation

now more than ever

as the baby boomers age and millennials come to prominence

We can talk all we want to about pickling businesses in Brooklyn

or avocado toast

but leaving out the stories and the voices of black millennials

large swaths of the population 

it will only increase divisions

So stories of black millennials brown millennials

and all millennials of color

really need to be told

and they also need to be listened to

We'd be a far betteroff country and world

Thank you

Applause

I am an astrodynamicist 

you know like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie The Martian

And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space

Currently we track about one percent of hazardous objects on orbit 

hazardous to services like location

agriculture banking

television and communications

and soon  very soon 

even the internet itself

Now these services are not protected from roughly half a million objects

the size of a speck of paint

all the way to a school bus in size

A speck of paint

traveling at the right speed

impacting one of these objects

could render it absolutely useless

But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint

We can only track things as small as say a smartphone

So of this half million objects that we should be concerned about

we can only track about  of these objects

And of these  only  actually work

Everything else

is garbage

That's a lot of garbage

To make things a little bit worse

most of what we launch into orbit never comes back

We send the satellite in orbit

it stops working it runs out of fuel

and we send something else up 

and then we send up something else 

and then something else

And every once in a while

two of these things will collide with each other

or one of these things will explode

or even worse

somebody might just happen to destroy one of their satellites on orbit

and this generates many many more pieces

most of which also never come back

Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit

It turns out that given the curvature of spacetime

there are ideal locations

where we put some of these satellites 

think of these as space highways

Very much like highways on earth

these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic

to sustain spacesafe operations

Unlike highways on earth

there are actually no space traffic rules

None whatsoever OK

Wow

What could possibly go wrong with that

Laughter

Now what would be really nice

is if we had something like a space traffic map

like a Waze for space that I could look up

and see what the current traffic conditions are in space

maybe even predict these

The problem with that however

is that ask five different people

What's going on in orbit

Where are things going

and you're probably going to get  different answers

Why is that

It's because information about things on orbit is not commonly shared either

So what if we had a globally accessible

open and transparent space traffic information system

that can inform the public of where everything is located

to try to keep space safe and sustainable

And what if the system could be used

to form evidencebased norms of behavior 

these space traffic rules

So I developed ASTRIAGraph
astriagraph
the world's first crowdsourced space traffic monitoring system

at the University of Texas at Austin

ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe 
Astriagraph
government industry and academia 

and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access today

Here you can see  objects orbiting the earth

multiple opinions

and it gets updated in near real time

But back to my problem of space traffic map

What if you only had information from the US government

Well in that case that's what your space traffic map would look like

But what do the Russians think

That looks significantly different

Who's right Who's wrong
 
What should I believe

What could I trust

This is part of the issue

In the absence of this framework to monitor spaceactor behavior

to monitor activity in space 

where these objects are located 

to reconcile these inconsistencies

and make this knowledge commonplace

we actually risk losing the ability

to use space for humanity's benefit

Thank you very much

Applause and cheers

It was the spring of 

and as they like to say in commencement speeches

I was getting ready to enter the real world

I had recently graduated from college

and moved to Paris to start my first job

My dream was to become a war correspondent

but the real world that I found

took me into a really different kind of conflict zone

At  years old

I was diagnosed with leukemia

The doctors told me and my parents pointblank

that I had about a  percent chance of longterm survival

I couldn't wrap my head around what that prognosis meant

But I understood that the reality and the life I'd imagined for myself

had shattered

Overnight I lost my job my apartment my independence

and I became patient number 

Over the next four years of chemo a clinical trial

and a bone marrow transplant

the hospital became my home

my bed the place I lived 

Since it was unlikely that I'd ever get better

I had to accept my new reality

And I adapted

I became fluent in medicalese

made friends with a group of other young cancer patients

built a vast collection of neon wigs

and learned to use my rolling IV pole as a skateboard
IV
I even achieved my dream of becoming a war correspondent

although not in the way I'd expected

It started with a blog

reporting from the front lines of my hospital bed

and it morphed into a column I wrote for the New York Times

called Life Interrupted

But  Applause

Thank you

Applause

But above all else

my focus was on surviving

And  spoiler alert 

Laughter

I did survive yeah

Applause

Thanks to an army of supportive humans

I'm not just still here I am cured of my cancer

Applause

Thank you

Applause

So when you go through a traumatic experience like this

people treat you differently

They start telling you how much of an inspiration you are

They say you're a warrior

They call you a hero

someone who's lived the mythical hero's journey

who's endured impossible trials

and against the odds lived to tell the tale

returning better and braver for what you're been through

And this definitely lines up with my experience

Cancer totally transformed my life

I left the hospital knowing exactly who I was

and what I wanted to do in the world

And now every day as the sun rises

I drink a big glass of celery juice

and I follow this up with  minutes of yoga

Then I write down  things I'm grateful for onto a scroll of paper

that I fold into an origami crane and send sailing out my window

Laughter

Are you seriously believing any of this

Laughter

I don't do any of these things

Laughter

I hate yoga and I have no idea how to fold an origami crane

The truth is that for me

the hardest part of my cancer experience began once the cancer was gone

That heroic journey of the survivor we see in movies

and watch play out on Instagram 
Instagram
it's a myth

It isn't just untrue it's dangerous

because it erases the very real challenges of recovery

Now don't get me wrong  I am incredibly grateful to be alive

and I am painfully aware that this struggle is a privilege

that many don't get to experience

But it's important that I tell you

what this projection of heroism and expectation of constant gratitude

does to people who are trying to recover

Because being cured is not where the work of healing ends

It's where it begins

I'll never forget the day I was discharged from the hospital

finally done with treatment

Those four years of chemo had taken a toll on my relationship

with my longtime boyfriend

and he'd recently moved out

And when I walked into my apartment it was quiet

Eerily so

The person I wanted to call in this moment

the person who I knew would understand everything

was my friend Melissa

She was a fellow cancer patient

but she had died three weeks earlier

As I stood there in the doorway of my apartment

I wanted to cry

But I was too tired to cry

The adrenaline was gone

I had felt as if the inner scaffolding

that had held me together since my diagnosis

had suddenly crumbled

I had spent the past  days working tirelessly to achieve one goal

to survive

And now that I'd done so

I realized I had absolutely no idea how to live

On paper of course I was better

I didn't have leukemia

my blood counts were back to normal

and the disability checks soon stopped coming

To the outside world

I clearly didn't belong in the kingdom of the sick anymore

But in reality I never felt further from being well

All that chemo had taken a permanent physical toll on my body

I wondered What kind of job can I hold

when I need to nap for four hours in the middle of the day

When my misfiring immune system

still sends me to the ER on a regular basis

And then there were the invisible psychological imprints

my illness had left behind

the fears of relapse

the unprocessed grief

the demons of PTSD that descended upon me for days sometimes weeks

See we talk about reentry

in the context of war and incarceration

But we don't talk about it as much

in the context of other kinds of traumatic experiences like an illness

Because no one had warned me of the challenges of reentry

I thought something must be wrong with me

I felt ashamed

and with great guilt I kept reminding myself

of how lucky I was to be alive at all

when so many people like my friend Melissa were not

But on most days I woke up feeling so sad and lost

I could barely breathe

Sometimes I even fantasized about getting sick again

And let me tell you

there are so many better things to fantasize about

when you're in your twenties and recently single

Laughter

But I missed the hospital's ecosystem

Like me everyone in there was broken

But out here among the living I felt like an impostor

overwhelmed and unable to function

I also missed the sense of clarity I'd felt at my sickest

Staring your mortality straight in the eye has a way of simplifying things

of rerouting your focus to what really matters

And when I was sick I vowed that if I survived

it had to be for something

It had to be to live a good life an adventurous life

a meaningful one

But the question once I was cured

became How

I was  years old with no job no partner no structure

And this time I didn't have treatment protocols or discharge instructions

to help guide my way forward

But what I did have was an inbox full of internet messages

from strangers

Over the years

people from all over the world had read my column

and they'd responded with letters comments and emails

It was a mix as is often the case for writers

I got a lot of unsolicited advice

about how to cure my cancer with things like essential oils

I got some questions about my bra size

But mostly 

Laughter

mostly I heard from people who in their own different way

understood what it was that I was going through

I heard from a teenage girl in Florida

who like me was coming out of chemo

and wrote me a message composed largely of emojis

I heard from a retired art history professor in Ohio named Howard

who'd spent most of his life

struggling with a mysterious debilitating health condition

that he'd had from the time he was a young man

I heard from an inmate on death row in Texas

by the name of Little GQ 
Little GQ
short for Gangster Quinn

He'd never been sick a day in his life

He does  pushups to start off each morning

But he related to what I described in one column

as my incanceration

and to the experience of being confined to a tiny fluorescent room

I know that our situations are different he wrote to me

But the threat of death lurks in both of our shadows

In those lonely first weeks and months of my recovery

these strangers and their words became lifelines

dispatches from people of so many different backgrounds

with so many different experiences

all showing me the same thing

you can be held hostage

by the worst thing that's ever happened to you

and allow it to hijack your remaining days

or you can find a way forward

I knew I needed to make some kind of change

I wanted to be in motion again

to figure out how to unstuck myself and to get back out into the world

And so I decided to go on a real journey 

not the bullshit cancer one

or the mythical hero's journey that everyone thought I should be on

but a real packyourbags kind of journey

I put everything I owned into storage

rented out my apartment borrowed a car

and talked a very a dear but somewhat smelly friend

into joining me

Laughter

Together my dog Oscar and I embarked on a mile road trip

around the United States

Along the way we visited some of those strangers who'd written to me

I needed their advice

also to say to them thank you

I went to Ohio and stayed with Howard the retired professor

When you've suffered a loss or a trauma

the impulse can be to guard your heart

But Howard urged me to open myself up to uncertainty

to the possibilities of new love new loss

Howard will never be cured of illness

And as a young man he had no way of predicting how long he'd live

But that didn't stop him from getting married

Howard has grandkids now

and takes weekly ballroom dancing lessons with his wife

When I visited them

theyd recently celebrated their th anniversary

In his letter to me he'd written

Meaning is not found in the material realm

it's not in dinner jazz cocktails or conversation

Meaning is what's left when everything else is stripped away

I went to Texas and I visited Little GQ on death row
Little GQ
He asked me what I did to pass all that time

I'd spent in a hospital room

When I told him that I got really really good at Scrabble

he said Me too and explained how
 
even though he spends most of his days in solitary confinement

he and his neighboring prisoners make board games out of paper

and call out their plays through their meal slots 

a testament to the incredible tenacity of the human spirit

and our ability to adapt with creativity

And my last stop was in Florida

to see that teenage girl who'd sent me all those emojis

Her name is Unique which is perfect

because she's the most luminous curious person I've ever met

I asked her what she wants to do next and she said

I want to go to college and travel

and eat weird foods like octopus that I've never tasted before

and come visit you in New York

and go camping but I'm scared of bugs

but I still want to go camping

I was in awe of her

that she could be so optimistic and so full of plans for the future

given everything she'd been through

But as Unique showed me
Unique
it is far more radical and dangerous to have hope

than to live hemmed in by fear

But the most important thing I learned on that road trip

is that the divide between the sick and the well 

it doesn't exist

The border is porous

As we live longer and longer

surviving illnesses and injuries that would have killed our grandparents

even our parents

the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms

spending much of our lives somewhere between the two

These are the terms of our existence

Now I wish I could say that since coming home from my road trip

I feel fully healed

I don't

But once I stopped expecting myself

to return to the person I'd been prediagnosis

once I learned to accept my body and its limitations

I actually did start to feel better

And in the end I think that's the trick

to stop seeing our health as binary

between sick and healthy

well and unwell

whole and broken

to stop thinking that there's some beautiful perfect state of wellness

to strive for

and to quit living in a state of constant dissatisfaction

until we reach it

Every single one of us will have our life interrupted

whether it's by the rip cord of a diagnosis

or some other kind of heartbreak or trauma that brings us to the floor

We need to find ways to live in the inbetween place

managing whatever body and mind we currently have

Sometimes all it takes is the ingenuity of a handmade game of Scrabble

or finding that strippeddown kind of meaning in the love of family

and a night on the ballroom dance floor

or that radical dangerous hope

that I'm guessing will someday lead a teenage girl terrified of bugs

to go camping

If you're able to do that

then you've taken the real hero's journey

You've achieved what it means to actually be well

which is to say alive in the messiest richest most whole sense

Thank you that's all I've got

Applause

Thank you

David Biello So Victor what have you been up to

Victor Vescovo That's the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

and I guess I read too much Jules Verne as a young boy

and so for the last four years I've led a team to design and build

what is now the most advanced and deepest diving submersible on the planet

and I have the ability to personally pilot it too

So this was us in December of last year

for the first time  the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

DB And nobody's seen that before right
DB
That's just you VV No
 VV
Well now everybody else

DB Who does that
DB
Like 

VV Well I think everyone has seen the developments in the last   years

You have a bunch of people that have the means to explore outer space

like SpaceX or Blue Origin 
SpaceXBlue Origin
those guys 

and we're going the other direction

So it's a wonderful era

of private individuals spending their resources

to develop technologies that can take us to places

that have never been explored before

and the oceans of the world is 

it's almost a clich to say it's  percent of our entire planet

and of that  percent is unexplored

So what we're trying to do with our expedition

is to build and prove out a submersible

that can go to any point on the bottom of the planet

to explore the  percent of this planet that is still unexplored

DB You need a pretty cool tool to do that right
DB
VV Right
VV
Now the tool is the submarine the Limiting Factor

It's a stateoftheart vessel

supported by the support ship the Pressure Drop

It has a twoperson titanium sphere  millimetersthick

that keeps it at one atmosphere

and it has the ability to dive repeatedly

down to the very deepest point of the ocean

DB So like the SpaceX of ocean exploration
DBSpaceX
VV Yeah it's kind of the SpaceX of ocean exploration
VVX
but I pilot my own vehicles

Laughter

DB Are you going to take Elon or
DB
VV Yeah I could take someone down there

So Elon if you're listening

I'll give you a ride in mine if you give me a ride in yours

Laughter

DB So tell us what it's like down there
DB
I mean we're talking about a place where the pressure is so intense

that it's like putting an Eiffel Tower on your toe

VV It's more than that
VV
It's about  psi

So the issue is that we have this titanium sphere

that allows us to go down to these extreme depths

and come up repeatedly

That's never been done before

The Challenger Deep has been dived twice

once in  and once in  by James Cameron

and they went down and came back up and those were experimental craft

This is the first commercially certified submersible

that can go up and down thousands of times with two people

including a scientist

We're very proud that we took down

the deepestdiving British citizen in history

just three weeks ago Dr Alan Jamieson of Newcastle University
Alan Jamieson
who was down with us on the Java Trench

DB So not too much freaks you out is what I'm guessing
DB
VV Well it's a lot different to go diving
VV
If you're claustrophobic you do not want to be in the submarine

We go down quite a distance
We go down quite a distance
and the missions typically last eight to nine hours in a confined space

It's very different from the career I had previously

which was mountain climbing where you're in open spaces

the wind is whipping it's very cold

This is the opposite It's much more technical

It's much more about precision in using the instruments

and troubleshooting anything that can go wrong

But if something really goes wrong in the submersible

you're not going to know it

Laughter

DB So you're afraid of leaks is what you're saying
DB
VV Leaks are not good but if it's a leak that's happening
VV
it's not that bad because if it was really bad

you wouldn't know it again but 

you know fire in the capsule that wouldn't be good either

but it's actually a very safe submersible

I like to say I don't trust a lot of things in life

but I do trust titanium I trust math

and I trust finite element analysis

which is how you figure out

whether or not things like this can survive

these extraordinary pressures and conditions

DB And that sphere is so perfectly machined right
DB
This is a truly unique craft

VV That was the real trick 

is actually building a titanium sphere

that was accurate to within  percent of machine

Titanium is a hard metal to work

and a lot of people haven't figured it out

but we were very fortunate

Our extraordinary team was able to make an almost perfect sphere

which when you're subjecting something to pressure

that's the strongest geometry you can have

When I'm in the submersible and that hatch closes

I'm confident that I'm going to go down and come back up

DB And that's the thing you doublecheck 
DB
that the hatch is closed

VV There are only two rules in diving a submarine
VV
Number one is close the hatch securely

Number two is go back to rule number one

DB Alright so Atlantic Ocean check
DB
Southern Ocean check

VV No one has ever dived the Southern Ocean before
VV
I know why

It's really really hostile

The weather is awful

The word collision comes to mind

But we did that one yes

Glad that's over  DB Yeah 
DB
VV Thank you
VV
Applause

DB It's like you're racing through it
DB
And now the Indian Ocean as Kelly mentioned

VV Yeah that was three weeks ago

We were fortunate enough to actually solve the mystery

If someone had asked me three weeks ago

What is the deepest point in the Indian Ocean 
 
no one really knew

There were two candidates

one off of Western Australia and one in the Java Trench

We have this wonderful ship with a brilliant sonar

We mapped both of them

We sent landers down to the bottom and verified

It's actually in the center portion of the Java Trench

which is where no one thought it was

In fact every time we've completed one of our major dives

we have to run off to Wikipedia and change it

because it's completely wrong

Laughter

DB So it probably takes longer to get down there
DB
than the time you're able to spend down there

VV No we actually spend quite a bit of time

I have four days of oxygen supply in the vessel

If I'm down there for four days

something's gone so wrong I'm probably not going to use it

but it's about three hours down to the deepest part of the ocean

and then we can spend usually three or four hours

and then another three hours up

So you don't want to stay in there for more than  or  hours

It can get a little tight

DB Alright so the bottom of the Indian Ocean
DB
And this is something that no one besides you has ever seen before 

VV This is actually imagery from one of our robotic landers
VV
On the bottom right you can actually see a robust assfish 

that's what it's actually called

Laughter

But you can see from the left a creature that's never been seen before

It's actually a bottomdwelling jellyfish called a stalked ascidian

and none of them have ever looked like this before

It actually has a small child at the bottom of its stalk

and it just drifted across beautifully

So every single dive we have gone on

even though we're only down there for a couple of hours

we have found three or four new species

because these are places that have been isolated for billions of years

and no human being has ever been down there to film them

or take samples

And so this is extraordinary for us 

Applause

So what we are hoping 

the main objective of our mission is to build this tool

This tool is a door

because with this tool

we'll be able to make more of them potentially

and take scientists down to do thousands of dives

to open that door to exploration

and find things that we had no idea even existed

DB And so more people have been to space than the bottom of the ocean
DB
You're one of three

You're going to up that number you're going to give it away

VV Yeah three people have dived to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
VV
The USS Trieste in  with two individuals

James Cameron in  with his Deep Sea Challenger 

thank you Jim great sub

This is a thirdgeneration technology

We're not only going to try and go down actually in two weeks

but we're going to try and do it multiple times

which has never been done before

If we can do that we'll have proven the technology

and that door will not just go open it will stay open

Applause

DB Fantastic Good luck
DB
VV Thank you very much DB Thank you
VV DB
VV Thank you all

Alright let's get this kicked off

Music

Singing It's OK to be gay

We are different in many ways

Doesn't matter if you're a boy girl or somewhere in between

we all are part of one big family

Gay means happy

Queer Kid Stuff

You are enough

here at Queer Kid Stuff

Applause

Opening a performance with lyrics like It's OK to be gay

for a roomful of adults is one thing

but it's entirely different for a roomful of kindergartners

What you've just heard is the theme song for my web series Queer Kid Stuff

where I make LGBTQ and social justice videos for all ages
LGBTQ
And when I say all ages I mean literal babies

to your greatgreatgrandma

Now I know what you're thinking

Whoa they're talking about gay stuff with kids

But talking to kids about gay stuff is actually crucial

The American Academy of Pediatrics has found

that children have a solid understanding of their gender identity

by the age of four

This is when children are developing their sense of self

They're observing the world around them

absorbing that information

and internalizing it

Now most parents want their children to become kind empathetic

selfconfident adults

and exposure to diversity is an important part

of that social and emotional development

And  gender nonconforming kids

and trans kids and kids with trans and nonbinary and queer parents

are everywhere

In the series my stuffed bear cohost and I talk about the LGBT community
LGBT
activism gender and pronouns

consent and body positivity

We tackle these topics through songs

not unlike the one you just heard

simple definitions and metaphors

We approach these ideas to steal a phrase from an old professor of mine

from under the doorknob 

getting down to toddler height

and looking up at the great big world through their tiny little eyes

taking these seemingly complex ideas and simplifying them 

not dumbing them down

but homing in on the core concept

Gender is about how we feel and how we express ourselves

Sexuality is about love and gender and family

not about sex

And these are all ideas children can grasp

In one of my earliest episodes about gender

I used the idea of pronouns

to underscore the definition and introduce genderneutral pronouns

like they and them

I encourage children to think about their own pronouns

and to ask others for theirs

In later episodes I build on this foundation

and introduce big fancy words like nonbinary and transgender

I get emails from viewers in their s

who use my videos to explain nonbinary gender to their grandparents

But I get one comment over and over again

Let kids be kids

Well that's a nice sentiment and all

but only if it actually includes all kids

Just a few weeks ago

a yearold in Huntsville Alabama

died by suicide after being bullied for being gay

In  it was a sevenyearold

in Denver Colorado

There have been and will be many more

Lesbian gay and bisexual teens

are more than three times more likely to attempt suicide

than their heterosexual peers

and transgender teens are almost six times more likely

According to one study roughly one third of homeless youth

identify as lesbian gay bisexual or questioning

and about four percent of homeless youth identify as transgender

compared with one percent of the general youth population surveyed

According to the Human Rights Campaign

there have been  killings of trans people

in  cities across  states

since 

And those are the only the reported cases

And  percent of those killings were of trans women of color

The queer situation is bleak

to say the least

The YouTube comments on my videos
YouTube
are not much better

I'm used to the harassment

I get messages daily telling me I'm a pedophile

and that I should kill myself in a number of increasingly creative ways

I once had to put the word truck on my block list

because someone wanted me to get run over by a truck

Shower and oven are in there too

for the less creative and more disturbing Holocaust reference

When neoNazis marched in Charlottesville

I was unsurprised to learn

that the creator of a violent Reddit meme about one of my episodes
Reddit
was in the tiki torch crowd

This barrage of negativity is what we're up against

the crushing statistics the violence the mental health risks

the wellmeaning but flawed response my parents gave me when I came out

that they didn't want me to have a harder life

That's what we're up against

But in the face of all that

I choose joy

I choose rainbows and unicorns and glitter

and I sing that it's OK to be gay with my childhood stuffed teddy bear

I make queer media for kids

because I wish I had this when I was their age

I make it so others don't have to struggle through what I did

not understanding my identity

because I didn't have any exposure to who I could be

I teach and spread this message through joy and positivity

instead of framing it around the hardships of queer life

I want kids to grow up and into themselves

with pride for who they are and who they can be

no matter who they love or what they wear or what pronouns they use

And I want them to love others for their differences

not in spite of them

I think fostering this pride and empathy

will make the world a kinder and more equal place

and combat the bigotry and hate that festers in our world

So talk to a kid about gender

Talk to a kid about sexuality

Teach them about consent

Tell them it is OK for boys to wear dresses

and for girls to speak up

Let's spread radical queer joy

Thank you

Applause

Alright so I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend and it reads 

You will NOT believe what just happened I'm SO MAD right now

So you do the dutiful thing as a friend and you ask for details

And they tell you a story about what happened to them

at the gym or at work or on their date last night

And you listen and you try to understand why they're so mad

Maybe even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad

Laughter

And maybe you even offer some suggestions

Now in that moment you are doing essentially what I get to do every day

because I'm an anger researcher

and as an anger researcher I spend a good part of my professional life 

who am I kidding also my personal life 

studying why people get mad

I study the types of thoughts they have when they get mad

and I even study what they do when they get mad

whether it's getting into fights or breaking things

or even yelling at people in all caps on the internet

Laughter

And as you can imagine

when people hear I'm an anger researcher

they want to talk to me about their anger

they want to share with me their anger stories

And it's not because they need a therapist

though that does sometimes happen

it's really because anger is universal

It's something we all feel and it's something they can relate to

We've been feeling it since the first few months of life

when we didn't get what we wanted in our cries of protests

things like What do you mean you won't pick up the rattle Dad

I want it

Laughter

We feel it throughout our teenage years as my mom can certainly attest to with me

Sorry Mom

We feel it to the very end

In fact anger has been with us at some of the worst moments of our lives

It's a natural and expected part of our grief

But it's also been with us in some of the best moments of our lives

with those special occasions like weddings and vacations

often marred by these everyday frustrations 

bad weather travel delays 

that feel horrible in the moment

but then are ultimately forgotten when things go OK

I have a lot of conversations with people about their anger

and it's through those conversations that I've learned that many people

and I bet many people in this room right now

you see anger as a problem

You see the way it interferes in your life

the way it damages relationships maybe even the ways it's scary

And while I get all of that I see anger a little differently

and today I want to tell you something really important

about your anger and it's this

anger is a powerful and healthy force in your life

It's good that you feel it

You need to feel it

But to understand all that we actually have to back up

and talk about why we get mad in the first place

A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher

named Dr Jerry Deffenbacher who wrote about this back in 
Jerry Deffenbacher
in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger

Now for most of us and I bet most of you

it feels as simple as this

I get mad when I'm provoked

You hear it in the language people use

They say things like

It makes me so mad when people drive this slow

or I got mad because she left the milk out again

Or my favorite

I don't have an anger problem  people just need to stop messing with me

Laughter

Now in the spirit of better understanding those types of provocations

I ask a lot of people including my friends and colleagues and even family

What are the things that really get to you

What makes you mad

By the way now is a good time to point out one of the advantages

of being an anger researcher

is that I've spent more than a decade generating a comprehensive list

of all the things that really irritate my colleagues

Just in case I need it

Laughter

But their answers are fascinating

because they say things like

when my sports team loses

people who chew too loudly

That is surprisingly common by the way

People who walk too slowly that one's mine

And of course roundabouts

Roundabouts 

Laughter

I can tell you honestly there is no rage like roundabout rage

Laughter

Sometimes their answers aren't minor at all

Sometimes they talk about racism and sexism and bullying

and environmental destruction  big global problems we all face

But sometimes

their answers are very specific maybe even oddly specific

That wet line you get across your shirt

when you accidentally lean against the counter of a public bathroom

Laughter

Super gross right

Laughter

Or Flash drives there's only two ways to plug them in

so why does it always take me three tries

Laughter

Now whether it's minor or major whether it's general or specific

we can look at these examples

and we can tease out some common themes

We get angry in situations that are unpleasant

that feel unfair where our goals are blocked

that could have been avoided and that leave us feeling powerless

This is a recipe for anger

But you can also tell

that anger is probably not the only thing we're feeling in these situations

Anger doesn't happen in a vacuum

We can feel angry at the same time that we're scared or sad

or feeling a host of other emotions

But here's the thing

these provocations  they aren't making us mad

At least not on their own

and we know that because if they were

we'd all get angry over the same things and we don't

The reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry

so there's got to be something else going on

What is that something else

Well we know what we're doing and feeling at the moment of that provocation matters

We call this the preanger state  are you hungry are you tired

are you anxious about something else are you running late for something

When you're feeling those things

those provocations feel that much worse

But what matters most is not the provocation

it's not the preanger state it's this

it's how we interpret that provocation

it's how we make sense of it in our lives

When something happens to us

we first decide is this good or bad

Is it fair or unfair is it blameworthy is it punishable

That's primary appraisal it's when you evaluate the event itself

We decide what it means in the context of our lives

and once we've done that we decide how bad it is

That's secondary appraisal

We say Is this the worst thing that's ever happened

or can I cope with this

Now to illustrate that I want you to imagine you are driving somewhere

And before I go any further I should tell you

if I were an evil genius

and I wanted to create a situation that was going to make you mad

that situation would look a lot like driving

Laughter

It's true

You are by definition on your way somewhere

so everything that happens  traffic other drivers road construction 

it feels like it's blocking your goals

There are all these written and unwritten rules of the road

and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you

usually without consequence

And who's violating those rules

Anonymous others people you will never see again

making them a very easy target for your wrath

Laughter

So you're driving somewhere thus teed up to be angry

and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit

And it's frustrating

because you can't really see why they're driving so slow

That's primary appraisal

You've looked at this and you've said it's bad and it's blameworthy

But maybe you also decide it's not that big a deal

You're not in a hurry doesn't matter

That's secondary appraisal  you don't get angry

But now imagine you're on your way to a job interview

What that person is doing it hasn't changed right

So primary appraisal doesn't change still bad still blameworthy
 
But your ability to cope with it sure does

Because all of a sudden

you're going to be late to that job interview

All of a sudden

you are not going to get your dream job

the one that was going to give you piles and piles of money

Laughter

Somebody else is going to get your dream job

and you're going to be broke

You're going to be destitute

Might as well stop now turn around move in with your parents

Laughter

Why

Because of this person in front of me

This is not a person this is a monster

Laughter

And this monster is here just to ruin your life

Laughter

Now that thought process

it's called catastrophizing the one where we make the worst of things

And it's one of the primary types of thoughts that we know

is associated with chronic anger

But there's a couple of others

Misattributing causation

Angry people tend to put blame where it doesn't belong

Not just on people

but actually inanimate objects as well

And if you think that sound ridiculous

think about the last time you lost your car keys and you said

Where did those car keys go

Because you know they ran off on their own

Laughter

They tend to overgeneralize they use words like always

never every this always happens to me

I never get what I want

or I hit every stoplight on the way here today

Demandingness they put their own needs ahead of the needs of others

I don't care why this person is driving so slow

they need to speed up or move over so I can get to this job interview

And finally inflammatory labeling

They call people fools idiots monsters

or a whole bunch of things I've been told I'm not allowed to say

during this TED Talk
TED
Laughter

So for a long time

psychologists have referred to these as cognitive distortions

or even irrational beliefs

And yeah sometimes they are irrational

Maybe even most of the time

But sometimes these thoughts are totally rational

There is unfairness in the world

There are cruel selfish people

and it's not only OK to be angry when we're treated poorly

it's right to be angry when we're treated poorly

If there's one thing I want you to remember from my talk today it's this

your anger exists in you as an emotion

because it offered your ancestors both human and nonhuman

with an evolutionary advantage

Just as your fear alerts you to danger

your anger alerts you to injustice

It's one of the ways your brain communicates to you

that you have had enough

What's more it energizes you to confront that injustice

Think for a second about the last time you got mad

Your heart rate increased

Your breathing increased you started to sweat

That's your sympathetic nervous system

otherwise known as your fightorflight system

kicking in to offer you the energy you need to respond

And that's just the stuff you noticed

At the same time your digestive system slowed down so you could conserve energy

That's why your mouth went dry

And your blood vessels dilated to get blood to your extremities

That's why your face went red

It's all part of this complex pattern of physiological experiences

that exist today

because they helped your ancestors

deal with cruel and unforgiving forces of nature

And the problem is that the thing your ancestors did

to deal with their anger

to physically fight

they are no longer reasonable or appropriate

You can't and you shouldn't swing a club every time you're provoked

Laughter

But here's the good news

You are capable of something

your nonhuman ancestors weren't capable of

And that is the capacity to regulate your emotions

Even when you want to lash out

you can stop yourself and you can channel that anger

into something more productive

So often when we talk about anger

we talk about how to keep from getting angry

We tell people to calm down or relax

We even tell people to let it go

And all of that assumes that anger is bad and that it's wrong to feel it

But instead I like to think of anger as a motivator

The same way your thirst motivates you to get a drink of water

the same way your hunger motivates you to get a bite to eat

your anger can motivate you to respond to injustice

Because we don't have to think too hard to find things we should be mad about

When we go back to the beginning

yeah some of those things they're silly and not worth getting angry over

But racism sexism bullying environmental destruction

those things are real those things are terrible

and the only way to fix them is to get mad first

and then channel that anger into fighting back

And you don't have to fight back with aggression or hostility or violence

There are infinite ways that you can express your anger

You can protest you can write letters to the editor

you can donate to and volunteer for causes

you can create art you can create literature

you can create poetry and music

you can create a community that cares for one another

and does not allow those atrocities to happen

So the next time you feel yourself getting angry

instead of trying to turn it off

I hope you'll listen to what that anger is telling you

And then I hope you'll channel it into something positive and productive

Thank you

Applause

To start I want to share with you guys something about my hometown

of Norwalk Ohio

Now as this video stated I am from Norwalk

which is an extremely small town about  people

And really in Norwalk if you want to do something fun

you go to Walmart or drive half an hour to something more interesting

And for Norwalk I've lived there for my entire life

I'm a senior at the local public high school

and you know it's something to where I really enjoy my small town

And I'm just a normal kid you know

I lead debate clubs I volunteer at my church

And back in November of 

I made a small Reddit post asking for advice
Reddit
on an issue that I was encountering that I needed some clarification on

And this issue as was stated in the introduction

was something towards vaccinations

and how I was not immunized against various diseases

including polio and measles as well as influenza HPV hepatitis 
HPV
the standard vaccine someone my age would receive

Now this question I asked was simple and pretty strange

because you know I wanted to get vaccinated

That's kind of weird but it happened

and then this turned into a public story

because I wanted to get vaccinated

So that was kind of strange and then it blew up more

and I was doing interviews and talking to more people

and again I'm a normal kid I'm not a scientist

I don't lead a nonprofit I am a pretty casual person

I'm wearing a hoodie

Laughter

Because of this question and this story

because I wanted to get vaccinated

and this interesting situation I was in

I saw that I quickly was in this public setting

of an extremely important controversy and discussion taking place

Now I saw that the stories and headlines were pretty accurate for most part

you know After defying antivax mom
Vax
Ohio teen expresses why he got vaccinated

Pretty accurate pretty true

And as stated I testified in front of a Senate committee

so there they said

This teen who selfvaccinated

just ripped his mom's antivaxer beliefs in front of Congress
Vaxer
OK I didn't really do that but that's fine

And certain news outlets took it a little further

'God knows how I'm still alive'

Teenager  finally gets vaccinated and attacks his antivax parents
vax
So I did not attack my parents that's not accurate at all

And you know really my story was more about controversy

It was about how my mom was bad and I was good

and I was ripping her a new one

Not true

Not what was happening

I never was rude towards my mother

and even in public settings where I expressed

how her beliefs were misinformed

I said that she was a loving mother and that's important to understand

Because a lot of people I think in the scientific community

that understand why vaccines are so important

can really be confused by someone who would not vaccinate

Really we can compare it to someone not taking their child to the ER

That's a very dangerous situation to be in

and it shows some lack of empathy towards your children in some regards

And really I can understand that I can

But my mom she was misinformed and misled by sources that convinced her

that if she was a loving parent she wouldn't vaccinate

Now when I encountered this and I talked to my mom

it didn't obviously go well at first

because I was wanting to do something

that she thought would either cause autism or maim me for the rest of my life

and I said I wanted to do this  didn't really fly

didn't really go well

But the thing that I found interesting

was that when I had started to get into this circumstance

do these interviews

there was one question I proposed

Wasn't a positive one

What in the world have I gotten myself into

That's what I asked constantly

because again I am not an expert I am a normal kid

and now I'm talking to CNN and Fox News about a scientific discussion
CNN
that really should I be facilitating should I be commenting on

And a lot of people questioned that and for good reason

But I never claimed things I didn't understand

I talked about my personal experiences

And even at the Senate hearing

I just talked about how misinformation is dangerous

My mom got a lot of her beliefs from social media from Facebook
Facebook
and from organizations that were allowing their platforms to push lies

that were very dangerous

Now I also saw that as I was doing this 

and I was doing this as respectfully as I could

as accurately as I could 

I was getting a lot of criticism a lot of very angry people

When I was in DC for that testimony I gave

I was looking around the office building

and three ladies got in an elevator with me

and said I'm the reason their children are being maimed and murdered

and I'm basically Hitler

So that was fun

So really for most circumstances for most teenagers and most people

when they get criticized it leads to doubt

And that doubt leads to questioning and that questioning leads to quitting

Because when you have a topic that you're interested in

or a movement that you want to be a part of

and you're taking a stance and saying what's true

good ideas don't avoid criticism

And for especially young people they have a hard time dealing with that

and these important discussions that need young people to take a part in

it takes a lot of commitment

I'm not saying that I'm amazing but here's what's important

through me joining this movement and this important scientific discussion

here's what happened

Facebook changed their platform
Facebook
They were going to change how they approach antivax content
vax
Amazon even removed misinformed books about autism and vaccines

And recently GoFundMe took down antivax campaigns
GoFundMevax
We're talking about how movements like this are causing actual change

actually impacting the way this game is played

and the misinformation that's lying to people

and convincing them of very dangerous ideas

Now before I leave because I only have a short amount of time

I want to give you one important thing to keep in mind

One important takeaway from this all

What you can do and what I did

I didn't do amazing research and studies

and take information and present it to people

I didn't have deep intellectual scientific debates with people

All I did was share my story

And that's enough for most people

to understand the anecdotal experiences the real people behind the data

Because data doesn't resonate with people

People resonate with people

And you have to keep that in mind

because when you are talking about a topic

and you're sharing your story and sharing what is important

you stay authentic

Stay authentic to the data to the information

to the importance of this topic

If I was talking to an individual

and they said Why are vaccines important

I would say nothing alongside any other answer

I would not in any way fathomably give them answer outside of

people are dying and that's important

And that children are dying and that's important

And that we're having disease outbreaks that should not be here

And I believe as John Boyle put it

these diseases should be in history books and not in our communities

So because of that you need to make a personal decision to stand up for truth

You need to make a personal decision for yourself

to say This is accurate this is what's real

and these lies are not OK

Because it started with me doing that on a personal level

I wasn't going from small town to Senate in a day

It wasn't like I go to bed I wake up

and there's Senator Isakson asking me questions about vaccines
Isakson
It was a slow progression and it started with me saying

This is true

my mom doesn't believe it but that's OK

Because that doesn't change the truth

doesn't change what's accurate and what's important

And honestly the biggest thing

this whole idea of unbreakable remain unbroken

When you stand up for what's true and you have that criticism

and you're trying to cause a movement don't sway

Thank you

Hello

I'd like to introduce you to someone

This is Jomny

That's Jonny but spelled accidentally with an m
Jonnym
in case you were wondering

because we're not all perfect

Jomny is an alien

who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans

Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home

and I think we've all felt this way

Or at least I have

I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life

when I was feeling particularly alien

I had just moved to Cambridge and started my doctoral program at MIT

and I was feeling intimidated and isolated and very much like I didn't belong

But I had a lifeline of sorts

See I was writing jokes for years and years

and sharing them on social media

and I found that I was turning to doing this more and more

Now for many people the internet can feel like a lonely place

It can feel like this

a big endless expansive void

where you can constantly call out to it but no one's ever listening

But I actually found a comfort in speaking out to the void

I found in sharing my feelings with the void

eventually the void started to speak back

And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all

but instead it's full of all sorts of other people

also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard

Now there have been many bad things that have come from social media

I'm not trying to dispute that at all

To be online at any given point is to feel so much sadness

and anger and violence

It can feel like the end of the world

Yet at the same time I'm conflicted

because I can't deny the fact that so many of my closest friends

are people that I had met originally online

And I think that's partly because there's this confessional nature

to social media

It can feel like you are writing in this personal intimate diary

that's completely private

yet at the same time you want everyone in the world to read it

And I think part of that the joy of that

is that we get to experience things from perspectives from people

who are completely different from ourselves

and sometimes that's a nice thing

For example when I first joined Twitter
Twitter
I found that so many of the people that I was following

were talking about mental health and going to therapy

in ways that had none of the stigma that they often do

when we talk about these issues in person

Through them the conversation around mental health was normalized

and they helped me realize that going to therapy was something

that would help me as well

Now for many people

it sounds like a scary idea to be talking about all these topics

so publicly and so openly on the internet

I feel like a lot of people think that it is a big scary thing

to be online if you're not already perfectly and fully formed

But I think the internet can be actually a great place to not know

and I think we can treat that with excitement

because to me there's something important about sharing your imperfections

and your insecurities and your vulnerabilities

with other people

Laughter

Now when someone shares that they feel sad or afraid

or alone for example

it actually makes me feel less alone

not by getting rid of any of my loneliness

but by showing me that I am not alone

in feeling lonely

And as a writer and as an artist

I care very much about making this comfort of being vulnerable

a communal thing something that we can share with each other

I'm excited about externalizing the internal

about taking those invisible personal feelings that I don't have words for

holding them to the light putting words to them

and then sharing them with other people

in the hopes that it might help them find words to find their feelings as well

Now I know that sounds like a big thing

but ultimately I'm interested in putting all these things

into small approachable packages

because when we can hide them into these smaller pieces

I think they are easier to approach I think they're more fun

I think they can more easily help us see our shared humanness

Sometimes that takes the form of a short story

sometimes that takes the form of a cute book of illustrations for example

And sometimes that takes the form

of a silly joke that I'll throw on the internet

For example a few months ago I posted this app idea

for a dogwalking service

where a dog shows up at your door and you have to get out of the house

and go for a walk

Laughter

If there are app developers in the audience

please find me after the talk

Or I like to share every time I feel anxious about sending an email

When I sign my emails Best

it's short for I am trying my best

which is short for Please don't hate me I promise I'm trying my best

Or my answer to the classic icebreaker

if I could have dinner with anyone dead or alive I would

I am very lonely

Laughter

And I find that when I post things like these online

the reaction is very similar

People come together to share a laugh

to share in that feeling

and then to disburse just as quickly

Laughter

Yes leaving me once again alone

But I think sometimes these little gatherings can be quite meaningful

For example when I graduated from architecture school

and I moved to Cambridge

I posted this question

How many people in your life have you already had

your last conversation with

And I was thinking about my own friends who had moved away

to different cities and different countries even

and how hard it would be for me to keep in touch with them

But other people started replying and sharing their own experiences

Somebody talked about a family member they had a falling out with

Someone talked about a loved one who had passed away

quickly and unexpectedly

Someone else talked about their friends from school

who had moved away as well

But then something really nice started happening

Instead of just replying to me

people started replying to each other

and they started to talk to each other and share their own experiences

and comfort each other

and encourage each other to reach out to that friend

that they hadn't spoken to in a while

or that family member that they had a falling out with

And eventually we got this little tiny microcommunity

It felt like this support group formed

of all sorts of people coming together

And I think every time we post online

every time we do this there's a chance

that these little microcommunities can form

There's a chance that all sorts of different creatures

can come together and be drawn together

And sometimes through the muck of the internet

you get to find a kindred spirit

Sometimes that's in the reading the replies

and the comments sections and finding a reply that is particularly kind

or insightful or funny

Sometimes that's in going to follow someone

and seeing that they already follow you back

And sometimes that's in looking at someone that you know in real life

and seeing the things that you write and the things that they write

and realizing that you share so many of the same interests as they do

and that brings them closer together to you

Sometimes if you're lucky
Sometimes if you're lucky
you get to meet another alien

[when two aliebns find each other in a strange place
[
it feels a litle more like home]
]
But I am worried too because as we all know

the internet for the most part doesn't feel like this

We all know that for the most part

the internet feels like a place where we misunderstand each other

where we come into conflict with each other

where there's all sorts of confusion and screaming and yelling and shouting

and it feels like there's too much of everything

It feels like chaos

and I don't know how to square away the bad parts with the good

because as we know and as we've seen

the bad parts can really really hurt us

It feels to me that the platforms that we use to inhabit these online spaces

have been designed either ignorantly or willfully

to allow for harassment and abuse to propagate misinformation

to enable hatred and hate speech and the violence that comes from it

and it feels like none of our current platforms

are doing enough to address and to fix that

But still and maybe probably unfortunately

I'm still drawn to these online spaces as many others are

because sometimes it just feels like that's where all the people are

And I feel silly

and stupid sometimes

for valuing these small moments of human connection in times like these

But I've always operated under this idea

that these little moments of humanness are not superfluous

They're not retreats from the world at all

but instead they're the reasons why we come to these spaces

They are important and vital and they affirm and they give us life

And they are these tiny temporary sanctuaries

that show us that we are not as alone as we think we are

And so yes even though life is bad and everyone's sad

and one day we're all going to die 

[look life is bad everyones sad
[ 
We're all gona die but i alredy bought this inflatable bouncey castle
bouncey
so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not]

I think the inflatable metaphorical bouncy castle in this case

is really our relationships and our connections to other people

And so one night

when I was feeling particularly sad and hopeless about the world

I shouted out to the void

to the lonely darkness

I said At this point logging on to social media

feels like holding someone's hand at the end of the world

And this time instead of the void responding

it was people who showed up

who started replying to me and then who started talking to each other

and slowly this little tiny community formed

Everybody came together to hold hands

And in these dangerous and unsure times

in the midst of it all

I think the thing that we have to hold on to is other people

And I know that is a small thing made up of small moments

but I think it is one tiny tiny sliver of light

in all the darkness

Thank you

For the past  years I've been trying to change your mind

In my work I harness pop culture and emerging technology

to shift cultural norms

I've made video games to promote human rights

I've made animations to raise awareness about unfair immigration laws

and I've even made locationbased augmented reality apps

to change perceptions around homelessness

well before Pokmon Go
Pok  mon Go
Laughter

But then I began to wonder whether a game or an app

can really change attitudes and behaviors

and if so can I measure that change

What's the science behind that process

So I shifted my focus from making media and technology

to measuring their neurobiological effects

Here's what I discovered

The web mobile devices virtual and augmented reality

were rescripting our nervous systems

And they were literally changing the structure of our brain

The very technologies I had been using to positively influence hearts and minds

were actually eroding functions in the brain necessary for empathy

and decisionmaking

In fact our dependence upon the web and mobile devices

might be taking over our cognitive and affective faculties

rendering us socially and emotionally incompetent

and I felt complicit in this dehumanization

I realized that before I could continue making media about social issues

I needed to reverse engineer the harmful effects of technology

To tackle this I asked myself

How can I translate the mechanisms of empathy

the cognitive affective and motivational aspects

into an engine that simulates the narrative ingredients

that move us to act

To answer this I had to build a machine

Laughter

I've been developing an opensource biometric lab

an AI system which I call the Limbic Lab

The lab not only captures

the brain and body's unconscious response to media and technology

but also uses machine learning to adapt content

based on these biological responses

My goal is to find out what combination of narrative ingredients

are the most appealing and galvanizing

to specific target audiences

to enable social justice cultural and educational organizations

to create more effective media

The Limbic Lab consists of two components

a narrative engine and a media machine

While a subject is viewing or interacting with media content

the narrative engine takes in and syncs realtime data from brain waves

biophysical data like heart rate blood flow body temperature

and muscle contraction

as well as eyetracking and facial expressions

Data is captured at key places where critical plot points

character interaction or unusual camera angles occur

Like the final scene in Game of Thrones Red Wedding

when shockingly

everybody dies

Laughter

Survey data on that person's political beliefs

along with their psychographic and demographic data

are integrated into the system

to gain a deeper understanding of the individual

Let me give you an example

Matching people's TV preferences with their views on social justice issues

reveals that Americans who rank immigration among their top three concerns

are more likely to be fans of The Walking Dead

and they often watch for the adrenaline boost

which is measurable

A person's biological signature and their survey response

combines into a database to create their unique media imprint

Then our predictive model finds patterns between media imprints

and tells me which narrative ingredients

are more likely to lead to engagement in altruistic behavior

rather than distress and apathy

The more imprints added to the database

across mediums from episodic television to games

the better the predictive models become

In short I am mapping the first media genome

Applause and cheers

Whereas the human genome identifies all genes involved

in sequencing human DNA
DNA
the growing database of media imprints will eventually allow me

to determine the media DNA for a specific person
DNA
Already the Limbic Lab's narrative engine

helps content creators refine their storytelling

so that it resonates with their target audiences on an individual level

The Limbic Lab's other component

the media machine

will assess how media elicits an emotional and physiological response

then pulls scenes from a content library

targeted to personspecific media DNA
DNA
Applying artificial intelligence to biometric data

creates a truly personalized experience

One that adapts content based on realtime unconscious responses

Imagine if nonprofits and media makers were able to measure how audiences feel

as they experience it

and alter content on the fly

I believe this is the future of media

To date most media and socialchange strategies

have attempted to appeal to mass audiences

but the future is media customized for each person

As realtime measurement of media consumption

and automated media production becomes the norm

we will soon be consuming media tailored directly to our cravings

using a blend of psychographics biometrics and AI

It's like personalized medicine based on our DNA
DNA
I call it biomedia

I am currently testing the Limbic Lab in a pilot study
Limbic
with the Norman Lear Center

which looks at the top  episodic television shows

But I am grappling with an ethical dilemma

If I design a tool that can be turned into a weapon

should I build it

By opensourcing the lab to encourage access and inclusivity

I also run the risk of enabling powerful governments

and profitdriven companies to appropriate the platform

for fake news marketing or other forms of mass persuasion

For me therefore it is critical to make my research

as transparent to lay audiences as GMO labels
GMO
However this is not enough

As creative technologists

we have a responsibility

not only to reflect upon how present technology shapes our cultural values

and social behavior

but also to actively challenge the trajectory of future technology

It is my hope that we make an ethical commitment

to harvesting the body's intelligence

for the creation of authentic and just stories

that transform media and technology

from harmful weapons into narrative medicine

Thank you

Applause and cheers

This is Sian Ka'an

Just south of Tulum on Mexico's Caribbean coast

it's a federally protected reserve

a UNESCO World Heritage Site

and one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet

But when I first visited in 

I was horrified and completely confused

as to why the beach was covered in trash

I soon realized that it was floating in from all over the world

I've since returned after that first journey

several times a year

to visit Sian Ka'an to the country of my birth

to work with this trash

And so far

we've documented garbage from  different countries and territories

on six continents

all washing ashore in this paradise in Mexico

Although I can never know where a product was dropped

I can at times based on the label know where something was made

In red you see all of the countries represented by their trash

in Sian Ka'an

Such as these Haitian butter containers in all shapes and sizes

Jamaican water bottles

Not surprisingly a lot of the stuff is from neighboring Caribbean countries

but the stuff is from everywhere

Here's a sampling of international water bottles

And one of the ironies is that a lot of what I'm finding

are products for cleaning and beautification

such as this item from the United States

which is actually made to protect your plastic

Laughter

shampoo from South Korea

bleach from Costa Rica

and a Norwegian toilet cleaner

And it's items that are all very familiar to us

or at least I hope you're familiar with these toothbrushes

Laughter

Kitchen utensils

Toys

I'm also finding evidence of burning plastic trash

which releases cancercausing fumes into the air

People ask what's the most interesting item that I've found

and that's by far this prosthetic leg

And in the background if you can see that blue little bottle cap

at the time that I found it

it was actually the home to this little hermit crab

This guy is so cute

Laughter

Laughter

And it's these fascinating objects

but also horrifying objects

each with their own history

that I use to make my ephemeral environmental artworks

And it all started with this image in February of 

when I first visited Sian Ka'an

I noticed that blue was the most prevalent color among the plastic

Purple is actually the most rare color It's kind of like gold to me
 
But blue is the most prevalent

and so I gathered some of the blues

and made this little arrangement in front of the blue sky

and blue Caribbean waters

And when I took a photograph and looked at the test shot

it was like a lightning bolt hit me in that moment

and I knew I was going to have to come back

to create a whole series of installations on location

and photograph them

So this turned out to be a sketch

for a work that I completed three years later

I had no idea that almost  years later

almost a decade later I'd still be working on it

But the problem persists

So I'm going to show you some of the images

from the series that I called Washed Up Transforming a Trashed Landscape

Please keep in mind that I do not paint the garbage

I'm collecting it and organizing it by color

on the same beaches where I find it

This is my precious trash pile as seen in 

after putting on a first edition of the Museo de la Basura

or Museum of Garbage

It's fully my intention to care for this garbage

to exalt it

put it on a pedestal

and to curate it

We have all seen devastating images

of animals dying with plastic in their bellies

And it's so important for us to really see those

and to take those in

But it's by making aesthetic  some might say beautiful  arrangements

out of the world's waste

that I'm trying to hook the viewer

to draw in those that might be numb to the horrors of the world

and give them a different way to understand what's happening

Some have described the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

as an island twice the size of Texas

but I've been told that it's hard to see

because it's more like a smog

So through my artwork

I attempt to depict the reality of what's happening with our environment

and to make the invisible visible

My key question at first after starting the project

was What do I do with the garbage when I'm done

I was told by some that it could be damaged goods

after traveling across the ocean and being exposed to the elements

that it could become degraded and potentially ruin a batch of recycling

The landfill was not a happy resting place either

And then finally it dawned on me

after all of the effort by me and all of the people who have helped me

collect and organize and clean this trash

that I should keep it

And so that's the plan

to use it and to reuse it endlessly

to make more artwork

and to engage communities in environmental artmaking

This is an example of a communitybased artwork that we did last year

with the local youth of Punta Allen in Sian Ka'an

A key part of the community work are the beach cleans

and education programming

And as this community around the project grows

and as my trash collection grows

I really believe that the impact will as well

And so over the years

I've become a little obsessed with my trash collection

I pack it into suitcases and travel with it

I take it on vacation with me

Laughter

And in the latest work

I've begun to break the twodimensional plane of the photograph

I'm really excited about this new work

I see these as living artworks

that will morph and grow over time

Although my greatest wish is that I run out of the raw material

for this work

we're not there yet

So in the next phase of the project

I plan on continuing the community work

and making my own work at a much larger scale

because the problem is massive

Eight million tons of plastic waste enter our oceans every year

destroying ecosystems

Right now as I speak there's literally an oil spill of plastic happening

I see this project as a plea for help and a call to action

Our health and future is inextricably linked

to that of our oceans

I call the project Washed Up Transforming a Trashed Landscape

but it's actually transformed me

and made me rethink my own behaviors and consumption

And if it can help anybody else gain more awareness

then it will have been worthwhile

Thank you so much

Applause

I'm here today to talk about fundraising

or as you probably think of it the other Fword
F
Laughter

Because if you want to change the world

you have to know how to pay for it

I'm not talking about being a good person 

you can do that for free

I'm talking about if you want to create something

start something

galvanize a community

improve the lives of others run for office

Every day great ideas die on the vine

because they don't have capital to get off the ground

And all of the work

the thought the vision that goes into the idea

isn't worth much if you can't pay your bills

And while most of the greatest social movements in history

were powered purely by an idea

and people's belief in that idea

real change and impact require resources

Real people do this work

they need real change real impact and resources

to actually make it happen

The people that believe in this work

have to have the support and the resources to do it

That's where I come in

I get essential resources

into the hands of people and visionaries on the front lines

doing work that matters

We spend the majority of our waking hours working

We spend more time working than we do with our loved ones

So I decided early on that I have to love my work

and it has to add value

And while I would love to be one of these people

who spearheads social change from the ground up

the thing I realized early on in my nonprofit career

is that the thing I'm good at

the thing I'm really good at

is raising money

And I love it

I think it is a privilege

to work alongside bold ambitious optimistic leaders

and the organizations they serve

So I teach people how to do the thing I'm good at

because the more people that learn how to be good at my end of this work

the more work will get done

And I teach everyone

I teach CEOs and presidents

and boards of directors and EDs

I teach development directors in all sorts of teams

and nonprofit newbies

social change agents and candidates

I teach anyone that wants to do something extraordinary

how to fund their dream

My dream is that there will be more people like me

doing this work well

and that development will be an undergraduate course at universities

so that fundraising animals like me will find this job out of the gate

instead of discovering it years later accidentally

I even have the curriculum developed

but short of overhauling undergraduate course requirements

I think tonight's probably a good first step

to get people to think about fundraising

more as an opportunity

and less as a dirty word

If you want to change the world you have to know how to pay for it

To do that well

you have to understand three big things

Your feelings about wealth and money

the importance of building relationships

and how to ask for what you want

Let's start at the top your feelings about wealth and money

What is your relationship to money

Money is complicated

it makes everyone squeamish

it makes everyone act kind of weird

Anyone who's ever had to split the check after dinner with friends

can tell you this

Imagine what it was like before Venmo
Venmo
Laughter

To help people learn how to raise money

you have to help them understand their deal with money

because everybody has baggage

Grew up poor Baggage
 
Grew up rich Baggage
 
Mad or envious that other people have more money than you

Baggage

Think people with money are smarter than you

Baggage

Laughter

Feel guilty that you have more money than other people

That's some firstclass baggage

Laughter

It's still baggage people it's still baggage

So whatever your deal is with your baggage

you have to reconcile it

if you're going to be able to ask for money

And here's a little tip about asking people for money

The only difference about really wealthy people and us

is that they have more money than us

That's it

Don't overcomplicate it

They come with their own baggage

When you think about how to do this work

it's important to remember that money makes the world go round

You hear that all the time but it's true

Whether you're a nonprofit forprofit or you pay your own bills

We often feel like talking about it is this icky embarrassing ugly thing

but it's just money

And it's a fact of life

So how you feel about it directly affects how you approach it

Like everyone else when I started out in this work

I had to examine and understand my own feelings about wealth and money

And I had to learn how to separate them

from how I feel about raising money for important causes

How I feel about asking for money to help people do good work in the world

is not the same as how I feel about asking for money for myself

This is an important distinction

When I go and talk to someone

I'm not asking them to pay my mortgage

I'm giving them an opportunity to invest in an idea

that's going to change the world for the better

Why should I feel bad about that

If you want to be good at raising money

you have to be able to reframe the ask

both for yourself and for other people

as an opportunity

Next you have to get prepared to build some relationships

People give to people they don't just give to ideas

And if they don't believe in the person running the place

you're already dead in the water

This is true whether you're in stocks or venture capital

politics or nonprofits

Building a relationship with people takes work

You have to care about more than just what you want or need

you have to also value what someone else wants or needs

I know it's a shocking terrible idea

But oftentimes closing gifts is understanding the person

more than it's important to know the product

And if you think building a relationship with people takes work

building a relationship with someone you're asking for money from

takes work and it takes homework

Have you done any research

Do you have any idea what they care about

Do you know why they should invest in your work

Can you answer that question in less than  seconds

If you can't the meeting is going to be pretty rough

And the answer can't be Because they're super rich

and they live in your zip code

When you talk to people and understand what they care about

it has to be in person

Fundraising is relational it's not transactional

And you have to ask them questions

When I sit down with a donor it goes something like this

Hi thanks so much for seeing me

How have you been

Did you guys go anywhere fun over holiday

Nice I love Mexico

Do you always go to the same place

Oh that's awesome

Are those your kids They're so cute
 
How old are they

Where are they in school

Oh that's a great school are you guys very involved there

Your spouse in on the board How's that
 
How did you guys meet

Oh at Santa Clara that's awesome

Are you super involved in the alumni network

So interesting

Where do you guys live again

That's great Is that your boat
 
Laughter

I literally go through all of these things right

And you know why

Because guess what I know now

I know they're out of  grand a year in schooling for the next  years

Right

Spouse is on the board of the kids' school

I know they're out of K probably

It's a sixfigure

They're both involved in their school alumni

that's probably K

They told me they live on the Upper East Side 

I can look up their apartment online and find out what their mortgage is

And I know they own a second home in Mexico

Oh and they own a boat

Which is like funny money right

So what I now understand 

Laughter

It's true

What I now understand

is that their dollar gift is probably more of a starter gift

And I should be thinking about ways to help them partner with us

and invest in a more meaningful way

I know this sounds a tad mercenary

I'm not confused about how it sounds

But here's what I want to tell you

because this is the part that all my clients always want to skip

because they think it's the fluff and it's not important

If you don't understand what they care about and what they value

how are you ever going to be able to tell them about your work right

I want them to fund our work I do

But I also want them to have a really meaningful experience as a donor

so that they feel like we're partners

and they're not an ATM right

So it's important to ask the questions

because the more you know about them

and you know what they value

the more you can steer the conversation

in a direction about your work that will resonate for them

And once you get past the gettoknowyou part

you get into the fun stuff

like Why are you philanthropic at all

Right

Why do you invest in new ideas

Do you want giving back to be a value you pass on to your children

Can we help you do that

It's really awesome it's meaningful

and remember it's a conversation

it's not a cross examination

it's not an interview

Don't walk in there and tell them everything you already know about them

because you did your research

You don't get extra points for knowing how to use Google

It's  percent them talking

 percent you listening

It's better to be a good listener than a good showman

And once you understand what they care about

you can talk to them about what you care about

You can tell them about you

Now when you do this

don't get too deep into the weeds or you'll lose them

It's a lot like when I sit down with guys in finance right

and I say

you know How's work

I'm looking for like a thumbs up thumbs down

But what I get sometimes

is a long description of how the markets are trending

and my brain leaves my body

and starts to think about what time my dry cleaner closes

Laughter

Like I don't have capacity for that

And they don't have capacity for that level detail of our work

If they want it they'll ask you the questions

It's this thing that happens over and over

because  here's an example

I worked with this CEO once

and I was hired to teach him how to talk to human people

like a human person

Laughter

It was a very difficult job

So he kept getting great donor meetings

and he wasn't closing any gifts

And I could not figure out what the problem was

so finally I was like I'm going to come with you

So I went with him to meetings and what would happen was

he was getting into such detail with the donors

that their eyes were glazing over

and then after he was done with his minute pitch

they literally would say 

this happened like three times in a row 

God that sounds great Congratulations
 
Keep up the good work

And that was the meeting

which was obviously not the outcome we were looking for

So he couldn't understand what I was trying to say to him

that I finally in an act of sheer desperation was like 

You know what I love

I love NASA
NASA
I love NASA
NASA
I think it is unbelievably amazing we have figured out

how to get a person to the Moon

I think it's awesome

I think the idea of getting someone to the Moon

and they walk on the Moon

and I love rocket ships

I love rocket ships rocket ships are amazing

But if you start to tell me about the rocket ship

and how it gets to the Moon

and the math and the science equations

on how the rocket ship gets to the Moon

I promise you I will hang myself with my own hair

Laughter

I was like That is not how you tell people about your work

What is the need

Like what's the point right

How do you address the need

why are you better at it than anybody else

And what can you do to make it about them

How can they help you get to the Moon

That's the good stuff

If you're able to do that you're probably ready to make the ask

Now I don't expect

everyone to be super excited to ask people for money

That's why development is an actual profession

and not an awkward hobby

Laughter

Naturally great fundraisers love people

they can and will talk to anyone

they can find common ground with anyone

they're your friends that talk to people in the elevator

or at the grocery store

They believe in the work required

to both build relationships and keep them

And they naturally have a high tolerance for rejection

But I don't expect everyone to be a natural

and you don't have to be a natural to raise money

You just have to respect the people and the process

and do the work

Will you reconcile your baggage

Will you commit to build relationships

If you will you're ready to make the ask

And the ask is oftentimes as simple as using the phrase

Would you consider

Would you consider becoming a monthly donor

Would you consider increasing your support to  dollars

Would you consider investing in our work at the onemilliondollar level

Would you consider does a couple of awesome things

One it gives the donor an easy way out

Like they can say no without it being yesno

And two it gives you a second ask

Well what would you consider

Laughter

It's good right

Laughter

When you do this remember you're not asking for yourself

You're asking on behalf of all of the people you serve

or are touched by your genius

This isn't a personal favor right

Feel proud of the ask  it's incredible that you do this work

Don't try to be someone you're not

you're going to go to these meetings and think you need to bigshot it

Be yourself authenticity matters nobody likes a phony

Just be yourself

And please

please don't torpedo your own ask

What I mean by this

is don't walk into the meeting and say  I had an ED that did this all the time
ED
I stopped inviting him

He'd say We're not here today to ask you for money

Laughter

Yes we are

Laughter

That's exactly literally why we're here today

Don't do that

Don't say Whatever you can do to help

That is hands down the fastest way to get the smallest possible gift

someone thinks they can give you and get away with

Not kidding

And don't take it back

Once you've made the ask 

Would you consider supporting us at the dollar level

Or the five Or the two Or one
  
You know what Take the year off
 
You're the best thanks

Don't do that

Ask the question

wait till  count to  before you speak again

keep your face like this

Laughter

They are grownups

They have all the power in this situation

They can answer the question

Don't take it back

Which brings me to my favorite

Don't ask don't get

If you don't make an actual ask

no one will give you actual money

And if no one gives you actual money

you actually can't do anything with it

It's very simple  don't ask don't get

Listen I would love to live in a world

where we didn't have to ask people for money

to do important work that will change people's lives

I would love to not have to teach people

how to make a case for the importance of feeding and housing

and educating people

But this is the world that we live in

and if we're committed to doing this work

and doing it well

we have to be as committed to the art of funding this work

as we are to the art of executing it

I'm going to repeat that because I think it's really important

We have to be as committed to the art of funding our work

as we are to the art of executing it

And at its core

the art of funding the work means that we have to truly believe

that the purpose and the privilege of our work

is to provide people

with an extraordinary way to use their wealth

that will change people's lives

It's an opportunity

because at its core that's what it is

And how great is that

Thank you

Applause cheers

Have you ever felt lonely

The urge of wanting to connect with people

but you seem to have no one you really would want to contact

Or it's a Friday night and you want to be with others

but you have no energy to go out so instead you sit at home all evening

watch Netflix
Netflix
and feel more alone than ever

You feel like a monster

between humans that know how to function

This is what loneliness felt like to me

So I'm an artist

and I process my emotional world by sharing my feelings through my art

If you share your feelings with someone

and they understand and share those feelings too

you create an emotional and deep connection

This is why you can be surrounded by hundreds of people

jump from one candidate to the next

but still feel lonely

It's because these deeper connections haven't been made

I was an alwayshappy child

I think we nearly have no single photo of me

where I don't smile broadly or laugh or joke around

And this went on until 

well it's still the case

But I had many friend groups

up until as a young adult I moved to another city

for my first job as a comic artist

And like so many young thriving people all over the planet

I concentrated all my energy into my work life

But if you spend like  percent of your daily capacity

trying to succeed at work

of course there is nothing left

to take care of all the other important aspects in your life

like your human relationships

Nourishing friendships as an adult is work

You need to be consistent with connecting

You need to be open you need to be honest

And this is all I struggled with

because I tend to camouflage my real feelings

by trying to appear always happy

and trying to make everyone else happy too

by trying to fix their problems

And I know a lot of us are guilty of this

because it's an easy way to not think about your own issues

Isn't it

Hmm Hmm Hmm
  
Laughter

OK

The turning point came

when I fell into an emotionally abusive relationship

just a few years ago

He isolated me

and left me feeling more alone than ever

It was the lowest point in my life

but it was also my wakeup call

because it was the first time

that I really felt loneliness

Many others put their feelings into their art

There are endless books movies paintings music

all filled with the real emotion of an artist

So as an artist myself I did the same

I shared my feelings

I wanted to help people cope with loneliness

I wanted yeah to make them understand it

to really experience it through my art

in the form of an interactive story

a video game

So in our game 

we called it Sea of Solitude 

you are a person named Kay

who is suffering from such strong loneliness

that her inner feelings 

the anger

the feeling of hopelessness worthlessness 

turn to the outside

and she becomes a monster

The game  well Kay 

is actually a representation of me

and the path I went through to overcome my struggles

The game plays actually in Kay's mind

so you walk through a world that is flooded by her tears

and the weather is changing by her mood

how her mood is changing

And well the only thing Kay wears

the only thing

is her backpack

It's the baggage we all carry throughout our life

And Kay doesn't know how to cope with her emotions in the right way

so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger

until it bursts

and she finally is forced to overcome her own struggles

In our story we present many different manifestations of loneliness

Loneliness through social exclusion is very common

In our game the brother of Kay got bullied in his school

and he just wants to hide and fly away

And we portray him as a huge bird monster surrounded by thick fog

The player has to actually walk through his school

and experience really feel the harm

that the brother had been through

because for a long time nobody really listens to him

But the very moment friends and family start to listen

the first step towards overcoming this form of loneliness had been made

We also show loneliness in relationships

like when parents just stay together for the sake of their kids

but end up hurting the entire family

We put the player literally in between the two parents while they are fighting

and you get hurt in the middle

They don't even see that their daughter Kay is right there

until she breaks down

We also show loneliness through mental health issues

with the boyfriend of Kay who suffers from depression

and shows that sometimes

it is most important to focus on your own wellbeing first

The boyfriend also tends to camouflage his feelings

so he appears like a lone shiny white wolf

But the moment he starts to interact with his girlfriend Kay

the mask falls off

and we see the black dog beneath it

depression

Sometimes we put on a smile

instead of dealing with the issues at hand

and that can ultimately make it worse

affect the people around us

and damage our relationships

So Kay herself

we portray as ripped apart into her basic emotions

Some help you

some are trying to stop you

SelfDoubt is a huge creature

always telling Kay how worthless she is

and that she should just give up

Like in real life

SelfDoubt is blocking the path

and it seems impossible to overcome it

Destroying the omnipresence of SelfDoubt is a slow process

But in the game you can slowly like shrink her

so she turns from selfdoubt

to actually healthy doubt

and you can finally trust her advice

We also show SelfDestruction

It's a huge monster

always lurking nearby under the water's surface

SelfDestruction is actually the main antagonist of the game

and she is always trying to drown you in the ocean of tears

But when she actually drowns you

you wake up just a few moments [before]

and you have a chance to progress again

We wanted to show

that we all go through hardships in our life we all do

But if you at least like stand up and try to move forward

you are very likely to make it through your struggle

step by step

Joy is something that Kay cannot really embrace or touch

It's always something in the distance

We portrayed Joy as a child version of Kay

with a yellow raincoat

so she is invulnerable to the ocean of tears

But Joy can also turn into obsession

and start to be actually harmful for Kay

like when she starts obsessing over her boyfriend

Joy will not turn back to normal until Kay realizes

that her happiness should not depend on anybody else

but herself

So our monsters appear huge and scary

but if you overcome your reluctance and approach them

you soon see that they are no monsters at all

but just fragile beings that are simply overwhelmed by what life throws at them

All of those emotions

be it selfdoubt or even selfdestruction

don't completely vanish in our game

The key message is to not only chase for joy or happiness

but to embrace all your emotions

and bring them into balance

being OK with sometimes not being OK

Everyone has their own loneliness story to tell

This realization changed everything for me

Being much more open with my emotions

and concentrating much more on my private life

my friends my family

When we released the game

literally thousands of fans wrote us

all sharing their stories with us

and telling us they felt not so alone anymore

just because they played our game

Many people wrote us that they felt hope

for a better future for themselves for the first time in decades

Many wrote us that they seek therapy now

just because they played our game

and felt hopeful to overcome their own struggles

Our game is not a therapy

It's not meant to be a therapy

It's just my friends and me sharing our stories

through our art video games

But we are so deeply thankful for every single message

that people feel better

just because we shared our story with them

So 

I didn't completely overcome my urge to help others

But I don't want to overcome it anymore

I love it

I just needed to bring it to a healthy size

so it doesn't stand in the way of deeper relationships anymore

but even help me to connect with people

So if you have an inner monster

that is born out of negative emotions

it is not only the goal to kill that monster

but to understand that we humans are complex beings

Look at what part of your life is so big that others fall short

Look at what emotions you barely feel

or maybe feel too much

and move towards lowering those peaks

Most of all it's about understanding

that all the wide range of emotions and struggles

makes us what we are

humans

Thank you

Unless you've spent quality time on the International Space Station

this is probably not a view you are super familiar with

This is the east coast of the United States

That's New York down there in the lower right

and it's a band of light all the way up through Washington DC

Those cities are shining like jewels

highways are traced by webs of light

And all of that light is super photogenic

But there's a problem

That light is meant to be illuminating our sidewalks

and our streets and our houses

Instead it's actually going up into the sky

and out into the universe

where it's not doing any of us any good

When I see photos of this of the Earth

I see environmental catastrophe

Those aren't jewels

those are tumors

I'm an astronomer

so it's really no surprise probably to anyone

that I've always loved the night sky

I'm kind of a walking clich

But when I was growing up in Minnesota

one of my favorite things to do on a summer evening

was grab my old Raggedy Ann sleeping bag
Raggedy Ann
and take it out into a field behind my house

where I would spend hours looking at the night sky

And to do this I had to brave not only the darkness

but also swarms of mosquitoes

and my sleeping bag really didn't smell very good

Laughter

But there was one particular star

that I would look for night after night

And then I would play this game

where I would try to focus on that star so intensely

that everything else would fade from my view

and that single star would be all that I could see

I could only ever hold on to that focus

for a few fleeting moments

But when I did

I felt this deep sense of connection to the universe

And almost a sense of vertigo

like I was going to fall into space

And when this happened 

I know this sounds kind of ridiculous

but I would simultaneously feel unfathomably insignificant

and also kind of weirdly important

That star I looked to night after night was called Vega

Vega is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra

which is not coincidentally the name of one of my dogs

Laughter

But this experience is being lost

My favorite constellation Lyra

this is what it would look like from Manhattan

For people who live in urban and suburban environments

if they go outside at night and look up

instead of being awestruck by the majesty of the universe

they see pretty much nothing

These unremarkable completely blank night skies

of course are due to all of the light we produce at night

Those very same lights we see all the way from space

are shining up into the atmosphere

where they bounce around and create this featureless smog of light

And that featureless smog of light has a name

It's called light pollution

As an astronomer

I can actually tell how bad light pollution is

by the brightness of stars I can see in the sky

And it turns out

that when you're trying to unlock the secrets of the cosmos

it's really helpful to be able to see the cosmos

And 

[Laughs]
[]
Truth

And this light that we're trying to detect

is coming from millions or billions of lightyears away

and so it's generally pretty faint

And as an astronomer

I fight with this every day to do my job

and I have to tell you it is a really big problem

But the problem is far worse

than just losing some whimsical ability to gaze at the stars

For example

countless plant and animal species are affected

So we could talk about sea turtles

or pollinators

or any of these super important species

that are also cute

Instead I want to talk

about these quietly unassuming dog whelks

You may have seen them around

and not given them really a whole lot of thought

But they're pretty cool

So in an entire year

a dog whelk will rarely move more than about  meters

That means that when they are attacking their prey

they can hit this brisk pace of about a millimeter an hour

And 

Laughter

This works out OK

because they attack things like barnacles

Laughter

So these dog whelks live in the intertidal area of coasts

where it turns out

they're a pretty key part of the ecosystem

Not only are they one of the most dominant invertebrate predators

but other animals like crabs and birds think they're pretty tasty

So that leaves these poor snails in a kind of precarious situation

because if they go too low in the water

then crabs are a threat

but if they come out of the water too far

birds are going to have a feast

Why is an astronomer telling you about dog whelks

I ask that myself

Because their behavior is impacted by light pollution

For example

if dog whelks are subjected to artificial light at night

they're about twice as likely to stay under the water with a predator

And that puts them at increased risk

And it's not like they can make a speedy escape

And so these 

Laughter

And the other issue is because they literally move

at a snail's pace

If a population is wiped out

it can take decades to replenish

And that in turn affects the rest of their ecosystem

and the other species like the birds and the barnacles and the crabs

So this is just one small and slimy example

of how light pollution can unleash a cascade effect

on an entire ecosystem

Virtually every species that has been studied to date

is impacted by light pollution

And that includes humans

So let's talk about us

You are probably not surprised to hear

that light pollution can affect your ability to sleep well at night

But you might be surprised to hear that light pollution is linked to obesity

In fact in a recent study

they found that light pollution contributed to over  percent

of the obesity rates in  countries

More than that

light pollution actually contributed about the same amount to excess weight

as eating junk food

And it gets worse

For people who are subjected

to significant amounts of artificial light at night

they're about  percent more likely to get breast cancer

And in fact light pollution is correlated with types of cancer

across the board

And in controlled lab experiments

there's a direct link between increased artificial light at night

and a rate of tumor growth

You might be wondering how normal light

could possibly impact cancer rates

It likely all comes down to the super important hormone

called melatonin

which we have evolved over millions of years

to produce on a daynight cycle or a circadian rhythm

What happens is that when light impacts

the retina at the back of our eye at night

it can disrupt melatonin production

and when melatonin production is disrupted

a whole chain of other chemical processes are affected

and that includes estrogen production

And when we throw this chemical balance out of whack

really bad things can happen

In fact things are so bad

that the International Agency for Cancer Research

has said that disrupting the human circadian rhythm

is a probable carcinogen

Also for fun I want to let you know

that light pollution has been linked to

let's see  headaches anxiety depression diabetes

cardiovascular disease and the list goes on

But maybe you don't care about your health

We're all going to die anyway

you might as well die in a brightly lit room

Laughter

The fact that you're laughing about death is kind of amazing

Laughter

You might still care about money

The money that's spent on that wasted light

and I mean just the light that's going out into the universe

and not doing us any good

is three billion dollars a year

That's enough money to build like

 utilitygrade windmills

or fund the entire DC publicschool system for over two years

or  this is my favorite because I really want one

but I can't afford one 

buy  Tesla Model X SUVs
XSUV
Laughter

And that includes the electric car tax credit

And then there are the existential costs

I don't have any data

on how losing touch with our place in the cosmos

impacts us

But I believe

that this probably impacts our humanity

more than any of the other scary statistics I can share with you

And it's getting worse with time

The amount of light pollution is doubling roughly every  years

That means that within the next decade

virtually the entire eastern half of the United States

will be perpetually brighter than twilight

And there's another issue with light pollution

The problem is way worse than we can see with our own eyes

Our eyes have evolved to just detect this tiny range

of the full spectrum of light

All of this other light that we can't see

this invisible light

also has a pollution problem

Mostly it's from modern technology

things like cell phones or cartocar radar

or now apparently we need appliances that can talk to each other

All of this modern technology is putting out strong signals

that can completely swamp

this exceedingly faint light we're trying to detect

from the rest of the universe outside Earth

which just for the record is most of the universe

Laughter

And then there are satellites

Satellites are a problem at both visible and invisible wavelengths

A host of private companies have plans to deploy tens of thousands of satellites

into Earth orbit

where they will not only outnumber

literally outnumber the visible stars in the sky

while also beaming invisible light back to Earth

So for astronomers like me

who use invisible light to study the universe

it's going to be like staring at the Sun

and trying to see a birthday candle behind it

Alright I want to be clear

that there's nothing inherently wrong with any of this modern technology

With cell phones or satellites or car radar

I'm not sure about kitchen appliances

Laughter

I haven't broken down

and gotten an oven that talks to my cell phone yet

And I use lights at night like everybody else

But here's the thing

Some problems in the world

like we've heard about today and you'll hear more about

are overwhelming and they seem intractable

Visible light pollution is not one of these problems

This is actually stupidly simple OK

So here are five super simple things you can do

Don't use lights brighter than you need to

Don't use lights when you don't need them

Those lights you're using

make sure they're shielded down

so they're not shining up into the sky

And let's talk about LED lights
LED
If you have a choice don't buy the blue ones

Look for words like warm white

If you buy LEDs with words like natural light or daylight
LED
that's like saying you hate space

Laughter

And finally

you could advocate for this

Even in your local community

find out if there's a lighting code

and whether it could be made more nightsky friendly

Or dare I say you could even advocate at the federal level

by politely asking our federal officials

some of whom may be here

to please not auction off our view of the invisible universe

to the highest bidder to pollute at will

which is actually what happens

Now like a good professor

I have homework for you

If you have never seen a truly dark night sky

I want you to go out and experience one for yourself

Because if you don't

you don't know what you're missing

and you don't know what humanity is losing

Thank you

Applause

For the past few years we've been calling men out

It had to be done

Applause

But lately I've been thinking we need to do something even harder

We need as my good friend Tony Porter says

to find a way to call men in

My father began to sexually abuse me when I was five years old

He would come into my room in the middle of the night

He appeared to be in a trance

The abuse continued until I was 

When I tried to resist him

when I was finally able to say no

he began to beat me

He called me stupid

He said I was a liar

The sexual abuse ended when I was 

but actually it never ended

It changed who I was

I was filled with anxiety and guilt and shame all the time

and I didn't know why

I hated my body I hated myself

I got sick a lot

I couldn't think

I couldn't remember things

I was drawn to dangerous men and women

who I allowed  actually I invited  to treat me badly

because that is what my father taught me love was

I waited my whole life for my father to apologize to me

He didn't

He wouldn't

And then with the recent scandals of famous men

as one after another was exposed

I realized something

I have never heard a man

who has committed rape or physical violence

ever publicly apologize to his victim

I began to wonder

what would an authentic deep apology be like

So something strange began to happen

I began to write

and my father's voice began to come through me

He began to tell me what he had done

and why

He began to apologize

My father is dead almost  years

and yet in this apology

the one I had to write for him

I discovered the power of an apology

and how it actually might be the way to move forward

in the crisis we now face

with men and all the women they abuse

Apology is a sacred commitment

It requires complete honesty

It demands deep selfinterrogation and time

It cannot be rushed

I discovered an apology has four steps

and if you would I'd like to take you through them

The first is you have to say what in detail you did

Your accounting cannot be vague

I'm sorry if I hurt you

or I'm sorry if I sexually abused you

doesn't cut it

You have to say what actually happened

I came into the room in the middle of the night

and I pulled your underpants down

I belittled you because I was jealous of you

and I wanted you to feel less

The liberation is in the details

An apology is a remembering

It connects the past with the present

It says that what occurred actually did occur

The second step is you have to ask yourself why

Survivors are haunted by the why

Why Why would my father want to sexually abuse his eldest daughter
 
Why would he take my head and smash it against a wall

In my father's case

he was a child born long after the other children

He was an accident that became the miracle

He was adored and treated as the golden boy

But adoration it turns out is not love

Adoration is a projection

of someone's need for you to be perfect

onto you

My father had to live up to this impossible ideal

and so he was never allowed to be himself

He was never allowed to express tenderness

or vulnerability curiosity doubt

He was never allowed to cry

And so he was forced to push all those feelings underground

and they eventually metastasized

Those suppressed feelings later became Shadowman

and he was out of control

and he eventually unleashed his torrent on me

The third step is you have to open your heart

and feel what your victim felt as you were abusing her

You have to let your heart break

You have to feel the horror and betrayal

and the longterm impacts of your abuse on your victim

You have to sit with the suffering you have caused

And of course the fourth step

is taking responsibility for what you have done

and making amends

So why would anyone want to go through such a grueling and humbling process

Why would you want to rip yourself open

Because it is the only thing that will set yourself free

It is the only thing that will set your victim free

You didn't just destroy your victim

You destroyed yourself

There is no one who enacts violence on another person

who doesn't suffer from the effects themselves

It creates an incredibly dark and contaminating spirit

and it spreads throughout your entire life

The apology I wrote  I learned something

about a different lens we have to look through

to understand the problem of men's violence

that I and one billion other women have survived

We often turn to punishment first

It's our first instinct but actually

although punishment sometimes is effective

on its own it is not enough

My father punished me

I was shut down

and I was broken

I think punishment hardens us but it doesn't teach us

Humiliation is not revelation

We actually need to create a process that may involve punishment

whereby we open a doorway

where men can actually become something and someone else

For so many years I hated my father

I wanted him dead I wanted him in prison
 
But actually that rage kept me connected to my father's story

What I really wanted wasn't just for my father to be stopped

I wanted him to change

I wanted him to apologize

That's what we want

We don't want men to be destroyed

we don't want them to only be punished

We want them to see us the victims that they have harmed

and we want them to repent

and change

And I actually believe this is possible

And I really believe it's our way forward

But we need men to join us

We need men now to be brave and be part of this transformation

I have spent most of my life calling men out

and I am here now

right now

to call you in

Thank you

Growing up in Missouri they would kind of

take us out into the woods

they would give you a map

and they would give you a compass

and you had to find your way home

and without the compass

you can't even read the map

That's what I'm here to tell you

The compass is the key

upbeat music

A compass is most simply a piece of metal

that has been magnetized so that it will turn

towards the Earth's magnetic pole

The one that we all think of is the pocket compass

It looks like a watch right

You can hold it in your hand

and watch the little needle bounce around

until you find north

Magnetism is still a pretty mysterious force to physicists

but what we do know for sure is that

a compass works because the Earth is this giant magnet

and when you use a compass you are in touch

with the very center of our planet

where this kind of roiling ball of molten iron

is spinning around and creating a magnetic field

Just like a magnet you can play with on your tabletop

it has a north pole and a south pole and we use compasses

to find our way north because of that fact

The earliest known compass comes from about  BC in China

They figured out that some of the metal

coming out of the ground was naturally magnetic

and so they fashioned this magnetized metal

into this kind of ladle looking thing

put it on a brass plate and then it would point north

It seems to have been primarily used

to improve feng shui so they could figure out

what was the best way for energy to flow

through their living spaces

Sailors were probably the early adopters

of the more portable versions of it

because no matter where the sun was

no matter what the condition of the stars were

they would always be able to kinda find north

Now much later the Europeans are the ones who

innovate and come up with the compass rose

It essentially laid out

what north south east and west looked like

and it also enabled you to kind of create new directions

like northwest southeast what have you

and for the first time they knew where they were going

That's kind of a big deal

but also I think it was part of this

general reinvigoration of European science

You might know it as the Renaissance

Lots of new tools were invented

from the telescope to the microscope

Maps got better because of compasses right

'Cause then you start to understand

which direction is which you get a lot more detail

and that just kind of changes

the human relationship to the world

The compass with a map is like a superpower

Everything that we think of as world history

would not have taken place without the compass

the age of exploration Magellan circumnavigating the globe

even the fact that we know it is a globe

The compass ends up getting embedded

in all these other tools because it is

such a functional object so you might have it

embedded in your multitool you might have it

embedded in your phone

The compass is everywhere because

it's literally how we find our way

across the face of the Earth

So you can go off and explore

and find out what is over that next hill

or that next horizon but you can also reliably

find your way home

Do you ever wonder why we're surrounded with things that help us do everything

faster and faster and faster

Communicate faster

but also work faster bank faster

travel faster find a date faster

cook faster clean faster and do all of it all at the same time

How do you feel about cramming even more into every waking hour

Well to my generation of Americans

speed feels like a birthright

Sometimes I think our minimum speed is Mach 

Anything less and we fear losing our competitive edge

But even my generation is starting to question

whether we're the masters of speed

or if speed is mastering us

I'm an anthropologist at the Rand Corporation

and while many anthropologists study ancient cultures

I focus on modern day cultures and how we're adapting

to all of this change happening in the world

Recently I teamed up with an engineer Seifu Chonde to study speed
Seifu Chonde
We were interested both in how people are adapting to this age of acceleration

and its security and policy implications

What could our world look like in  years

if the current pace of change keeps accelerating

What would it mean for transportation

or learning communication

manufacturing weaponry

or even natural selection

Will a faster future make us more secure and productive

Or will it make us more vulnerable

In our research people accepted acceleration as inevitable

both the thrills and the lack of control

They fear that if they were to slow down

they might run the risk of becoming obsolete

They say they'd rather burn out than rust out

Yet at the same time

they worry that speed could erode their cultural traditions

and their sense of home

But even people who are winning at the speed game

admit to feeling a little uneasy

They see acceleration as widening the gap between the haves

the jetsetters who are buzzing around

and the havenots

who are left in the digital dust

Yes we have good reason to forecast that the future will be faster

but what I've come to realize

is that speed is paradoxical

and like all good paradoxes

it teaches us about the human experience

as absurd and complex as it is

The first paradox is that we love speed

and we're thrilled by its intensity

But our prehistoric brains aren't really built for it

so we invent roller coasters and race cars and supersonic planes

but we get whiplash carsick

jetlagged

We didn't evolve to multitask

Rather we evolved to do one thing with incredible focus

like hunt  not necessarily with great speed

but with endurance for great distance

But now there's a widening gap between our biology and our lifestyles

a mismatch between what our bodies are built for and what we're making them do

It's a phenomenon my mentors have called Stone Agers in the fast lane

Laughter

A second paradox of speed is that it can be measured objectively Right
 
Miles per hour gigabytes per second

But how speed feels

and whether we like it

is highly subjective

So we can document

that the pace at which we are adopting new technologies is increasing

For example it took  years from the introduction of the telephone

to when the majority of Americans had phones at home

In contrast it only took  years for most of us to have smartphones

And how people act and react to speed

varies by culture and among different people within the same culture

Interactions that could be seen as pleasantly brisk and convenient

in some cultures

could be seen as horribly rude in others

I mean you wouldn't go asking for a togo cup at a Japanese tea ceremony

so you could jet off to your next tourist stop

Would you

A third paradox is that speed begets speed

The faster I respond the more responses I get

the faster I have to respond again

Having more communication

and information at our fingertips

at any given moment

was supposed to make decisionmaking easier and more rational

But that doesn't really seem to be happening

Here's just one more paradox

If all of these faster technologies were supposed to free us from drudgery

why do we all feel so pressed for time

Why are we crashing our cars in record numbers

because we think we have to answer that text right away

Shouldn't life in the fast lane feel a little more fun

and a little less anxious

German speakers even have a word for this

Eilkrankheit
Eilkrankheit
In English that's hurry sickness

When we have to make fast decisions

autopilot brain kicks in

and we rely on our learned behaviors

our reflexes our cognitive biases

to help us perceive and respond quickly

Sometimes that saves our lives right

Fight or flight

But sometimes it leads us astray in the long run

Oftentimes when our society has major failures

they're not technological failures

They're failures that happen when we made decisions too quickly

on autopilot

We didn't do the creative or critical thinking required

to connect the dots

or weed out false information

or make sense of complexity

That kind of thinking can't be done fast

That's slow thinking

Two psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky

started pointing this out back in 

and we're still struggling to do something with their insights

All of modern history can be thought of as one spurt of acceleration after another

It's as if we think if we just speed up enough

we can outrun our problems

But we never do

We know this in our own lives

and policymakers know it too

So now we're turning to artificial intelligence

to help us make faster and smarter decisions

to process this everexpanding universe of data

But machines crunching data are no substitute

for critical and sustained thinking

by humans

whose Stone Age brains need a little time to let their impulses subside

to slow the mind

and let the thoughts flow

If you're starting to think that we should just hit the brakes

that won't always be the right solution

We all know that a train that's going too fast around a bend can derail

but Seifu the engineer
Seifu
taught me that a train that's going too slowly around a bend can also derail

So managing this spurt of acceleration starts with the understanding

that we have more control over speed than we think we do

individually and as a society

Sometimes we'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster

We'll want to solve gridlock

speed up disaster relief for hurricane victims

or use D printing to produce what we need on the spot
D
just when we need it

Sometimes though we'll want to make our surroundings feel slower

to engineer the crash out of the speedy experience

And it's OK not to be stimulated all the time

It's good for adults

and for kids

Maybe it's boring but it gives us time to reflect

Slow time is not wasted time

And we need to reconsider what it means to save time

Culture and rituals around the world build in slowness

because slowness helps us reinforce our shared values and connect

And connection is a critical part of being human

We need to master speed

and that means thinking carefully about the tradeoffs of any given technology

Will it help you reclaim time that you can use to express your humanity

Will it give you hurry sickness Will it give other people hurry sickness
 
If you're lucky enough to decide the pace that you want to travel through life

it's a privilege

Use it

You might decide that you need both to speed up

and to create slow time

time to reflect

to percolate

at your own pace

time to listen

to empathize

to rest your mind

to linger at the dinner table

So as we zoom into the future

let's consider setting the technologies of speed

the purpose of speed

and our expectations of speed

to a more human pace

Thank you

Applause

Who doesn't love efficiency

I do

Efficiency means more for less

More miles per gallon more light per watt

more words per minute

More for less is the next best thing

to something for nothing

Algorithms big data the cloud are giving us more for less

Are we heading toward a frictionfree utopia

or toward a nightmare of surveillance

I don't know

My interest is in the present

And I'd like to show you

how the past can help us understand the present

There's nothing that summarizes

both the promise and the danger of efficiency

like the humble potato

The potato originated in the Andes

and it spread to Europe from the ancient Inca

The potato is a masterpiece of balanced nutrition

And it had some very powerful friends

King Frederick the Great of Prussia

was the first enthusiast

He believed that the potato could help

increase the population of healthy Prussians

And the more healthy Prussians

the more healthy Prussian soldiers

And some of those healthy Prussian soldiers

captured a French military pharmacist named Parmentier

Parmentier at first was appalled

by the morning noon and night diet

fed to POWs of potatoes

but he came to enjoy it

He thought they were making him a healthier person

And so when he was released

he took it on himself to spread the potato to France

And he had some powerful friends

Benjamin Franklin advised him to hold a banquet

at which every dish included potatoes

And Franklin was a guest of honor

Even the king and queen of France

were persuaded to wear potatoes

potato flowers pardon me

Laughter

The king wore a potato flower in his lapel

and the queen wore a potato flower in her hair

That was a truly great public relations idea

But there was a catch

The potato was too efficient for Europe's good

In Ireland it seemed a miracle

Potatoes flourished the population grew

But there was a hidden risk

Ireland's potatoes were genetically identical

They were a very efficient breed called the Lumper

And the problem with the Lumper
Lumper
was that a blight from South America

that affected one potato

would affect them all

Britain's exploitation and callousness played a role

but it was because of this monoculture

that a million people died

and another two million were forced to emigrate

A plant that was supposed to end famine

created one of the most tragic ones

The problems of efficiency today

are less drastic but more chronic

They can also prolong the evils

that they were intended to solve

Take the electronic medical records

It seemed to be the answer to the problem of doctors' handwriting

and it had the benefit

of providing much better data for treatments

In practice instead it has meant

much more electronic paperwork

and physicians are now complaining that they have less

rather than more time to see patients individually

The obsession with efficiency can actually make us less efficient

Efficiency also bites back with false positives

Hospitals have hundreds of devices registering alarms

Too often they're crying wolf

It takes time to rule those out

And that time results in fatigue stress and once more

the neglect of the problems of real patients

There are also false positives in pattern recognition

A school bus viewed from the wrong angle

can resemble a punching bag

So precious time is required

to eliminate misidentification

False negatives are a problem too

Algorithms can learn a lot  fast

But they can tell us only about the past

So many future classics get bad reviews like Moby Dick

or are turned down by multiple publishers

like the Harry Potter series

It can be wasteful to try to avoid all waste

Efficiency is also a trap when the opposition copies it

Take the late thcentury

French millimeter artillery piece

It was a masterpiece of lethal design

This piece could fire a shell every four seconds

But that wasn't so unusual

What was really brilliant was that because of the recoil mechanism

it could return to the exact same position

without having to be reaimed

So the effective rate of firing was drastically increased

Now this seemed to be a way for France

to defeat Germany the next time they fought

But predictably the Germans were working

on something very similar

So when the First World War broke out

the result was the trench warfare

that lasted longer than anybody had expected

A technology that was designed to shorten the war prolonged it

The biggest cost of all may be missed opportunities

The platform economy connecting buyers and sellers

can be a great investment

and we have seen that in the last few weeks

Companies that are still losing hundreds of millions of dollars

may be creating billionaires with initial public offerings

But the really difficult inventions

are the physical and chemical ones

They mean bigger risks

They may be losing out because hardware is hard

It's much harder to scale up a physical or chemical invention

than it is a softwarebased invention

Think of batteries

Lithiumion batteries in portable devices and electric cars

are based on a yearold principle

How many smartphone batteries today

will last a full day on a single charge

Yes hardware is hard

It took over  years for the patent

on the principle of dry photocopying

by Chester Carlson in 

to result in the Xerox  copier introduced in 

The small brave company Haloid in Rochester NY
Haloid
had to go through what most corporations would never have tolerated

There was one failure after another

and one of the special problems was fire

In fact when the  was finally released

it still had a device that was called a scorch eliminator

but actually it was a small fire extinguisher built in

My answer to all these questions is inspired inefficiency

Data and measurement are essential but they're not enough

Let's leave room for human intuition and human skills

There are seven facets of inspired inefficiency

First take the scenic route say yes to serendipity

Wrong turns can be productive

Once when I was exploring the east bank of the Mississippi

I took the wrong turn

I was approaching a toll bridge crossing the great river

and the toll collector said I could not turn back

So I paid my  cents  that's all it was at the time 

and I was in Muscatine Iowa

I had barely heard of Muscatine

but it proved to be a fascinating place

Muscatine had some of the world's richest mussel beds

A century ago a third of the world's buttons

were produced in Muscatine

 billion a year

The last plants have closed now

but there is still a museum of the pearl button industry

that's one of the most unusual in the world

But buttons were only the beginning

This is the house in Muscatine

where China's future president stayed in 

as a member of an agricultural delegation

It is now the SinoUS Friendship House

and it's a pilgrimage site for Chinese tourists

How could I have foreseen that

Laughter

Second get up from the couch

Sometimes it can be more efficient

to do things the hard way

Consider the internet of things

It's wonderful to be able to control lights

set the thermostat even vacuum the room

without leaving one's seat

But medical research has shown

that actually fidgeting getting up walking around

is one of the best things you can do for your heart

It's good for the heart and the waistline

Third monetize your mistakes

Great forms can be created

by imaginative development of accidents

Tad Leski an architect of the Metropolitan Opera

at Lincoln Center

was working on a sketch and some white ink fell on the drawing

Other people might just have thrown it away

but Leski was inspired to produce a starburst chandelier

that was probably the most notable of its kind of the th century

Fourth sometimes try the hard way

It can be more efficient to be less fluent

Psychologists call this desirable difficulty

Taking detailed notes with a keyboard

would seem to be the best way to grasp what a lecturer is saying

to be able to review it verbatim

However studies have shown that when we have to abbreviate

when we have to summarize what a speaker is saying

when we're taking notes with a pen or a pencil on paper

we're processing that information

We're making that our own

and we are learning much more actively

than when we were just transcribing

what was being said

Fifth get security through diversity

Monoculture can be deadly

Remember the potato

It was efficient until it wasn't

Diversity applies to organizations too

Software can tell what has made people in an organization succeed in the past

And it's useful sometimes in screening employees

But remember the environment is constantly changing

and software screening software has no way to tell

and we have no way to tell

who is going to be useful in the future

So we need to supplement whatever the algorithm tells us

by an intuition and by looking for people

with various backgrounds and various outlooks

Sixth achieve safety through redundancy and human skills

Why did two  Max aircraft crash
 Max
We still don't know the full story

but we know how to prevent future tragedies

We need multiple independent systems

If one fails then the others can override it

We also need skilled operators to come to the rescue

and that means constant training

Seventh be rationally extravagant

Thomas Edison was a pioneer of the film industry

as well as of camera technology

Nobody has done more for efficiency than Thomas Edison

But his cost cutting broke down

His manager hired a socalled efficiency engineer

who advised him to save money

by using more of the film stock that he'd shot

having fewer retakes

Well Edison was a genius

but he didn't understand the new rules of feature films

and the fact that failure was becoming the price of success

On the other hand some great directors like Erich Von Stroheim
Erich Von Stroheim
were the opposite

They were superb dramatists

and Stroheim was also a memorable actor

But they couldn't live within their budgets

So that was not sustainable

It was Irving Thalberg a former secretary with intuitive genius

who achieved rational extravagance

First at Universal and then at MGM

becoming the ideal of the Hollywood producer

Summing up to be truly efficient

we need optimal inefficiency

The shortest path may be a curve

rather than a straight line

Charles Darwin understood that

When he encountered a tough problem

he made a circuit of a trail

the sandwalk that he'd built behind his house

A productive path can be physical like Darwin's

or a virtual one or an unforeseen detour

from a path we had laid out

Too much efficiency can weaken itself

But a bit of inspired inefficiency can strengthen it

Sometimes the best way to move forward

is to follow a circle

Thank you

Applause

Value creation

Wealth creation

These are really powerful words

Maybe you think of finance you think of innovation

you think of creativity

But who are the value creators

If we use that word we must be implying that some people aren't creating value

Who are they

The couch potatoes

The value extractors

The value destroyers

To answer this question we actually have to have a proper theory of value

And I'm here as an economist to break it to you

that we've kind of lost our way on this question

Now don't look so surprised

What I mean by that is we've stopped contesting it

We've stopped actually asking really tough questions

about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction

productive and unproductive activities

Now let me just give you some context here

 was just about a year and a half after

one of the biggest financial crises of our time

second only to the  Great Depression

and the CEO of Goldman Sachs said

Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive in the world

Productivity and productiveness for an economist

actually has a lot to do with value

You're producing stuff

you're producing it dynamically and efficiently

You're also producing things that the world needs wants and buys

Now how this could have been said just one year after the crisis

which actually had this bank as well as many other banks 

I'm just kind of picking on Goldman Sachs here 

at the center of the crisis because they had actually produced

some pretty problematic financial products mainly but not only related to mortgages

which saw many thousands of people actually lose their homes

In  in just one month September

 people lost their homes through the foreclosures of that crisis

Between  and 

 million people lost their jobs

The bank also had to then be bailed out by the US taxpayer

for the sum of  billion dollars

We didn't hear the taxpayers bragging that they were value creators

but obviously having bailed out

one of the biggest valuecreating productive companies

perhaps they should have

What I want to do next is kind of ask ourselves

how we lost our way

how it could be actually

that a statement like that could almost go unnoticed

because it wasn't an afterdinner joke it was said very seriously
 
So what I want to do is bring you back  years in economic thinking

when actually the term was contested

It doesn't mean that they were right or wrong

but you couldn't just call yourself a value creator a wealth creator

There was a lot of debate within the economics profession

And what I want to argue is we've kind of lost our way

and that has actually allowed this term wealth creation and value

to become quite weak and lazy

and also easily captured

OK So let's start  I hate to break it to you 
 
 years ago

Now what was interesting  years ago

is the society was still an agricultural type of society

So it's not surprising that the economists of the time

who were called the Physiocrats

actually put the center of their attention to farm labor

When they said Where does value come from

they looked at farming

And they produced what I think was probably the world's first spreadsheet

called the Tableau Economique
Tableau Economique
and this was done by Franois Quesnay one of the leaders of this movement
Fran  ois Quisnay
And it was very interesting

because they didn't just say Farming is the source of value

They then really worried about what was happening to that value

when it was produced

What the Tableau Economique does 
Tableau Economique
and I've tried to make it a bit simpler here for you 

is it broke down the classes in society into three

The farmers creating value were called the productive class

Then others who were just moving some of this value around

but it was useful it was necessary

these were the merchants

they were called the proprietors

And then there was another class that was simply charging the farmers a fee

for an existing asset the land

and they called them the sterile class

Now this is a really heavyhitting word if you think what it means

that if too much of the resources are going to the landlords

you're actually putting the reproduction potential of the system at risk

And so all these little arrows there were their way of simulating 

again spreadsheets and simulators these guys were really using big data 

they were simulating what would actually happen under different scenarios

if the wealth actually wasn't reinvested back into production

to make that land more productive

and was actually being siphoned out in different ways

or even if the proprietors were getting too much

And what later happened in the s

and this was no longer the Agricultural Revolution

but the Industrial Revolution

is that the classical economists

and these were Adam Smith David Ricardo Karl Marx the revolutionary

also asked the question What is value

But it's not surprising that because they were actually living

through an industrial era with the rise of machines and factories

they said it was industrial labor

So they had a labor theory of value

But again their focus was reproduction

this real worry of what was happening to the value that was created

if it was getting siphoned out

And in The Wealth of Nations

Adam Smith had this really great example of the pin factory where he said

if you only have one person making every bit of the pin

at most you can make one pin a day

But if you actually invest in factory production and the division of labor

new thinking 

today we would use the word organizational innovation 

then you could increase the productivity

and the growth and the wealth of nations

So he showed that  specialized workers

who had been invested in in their human capital

could produce  pins a day

as opposed to just one by an unspecialized worker

And he and his fellow classical economists

also broke down activities into productive and unproductive ones

Laughter

And the unproductive ones weren't 

I think you're laughing because most of you are on that list aren't you

Laughter

Lawyers I think he was right about the lawyers
 
Definitely not the professors the letters of all kind people

So lawyers professors shopkeepers musicians

He obviously hated the opera

He must have seen the worst performance of his life

the night before writing this book

There's at least three professions up there

that have to do with the opera

But this wasn't an exercise of saying Don't do these things

It was just What's going to happen

if we actually end up allowing some parts of the economy to get too large

without really thinking about how to increase the productivity

of the source of the value that they thought was key

which was industrial labor

And again don't ask yourself is this right or is this wrong

it was just very contested

By making these lists

it actually forced them also to ask interesting questions

And their focus as the focus of the Physiocrats

was in fact on these objective conditions of production

They also looked for example at the class struggle

Their understanding of wages

had to do with the objective if you want power relationships

the bargaining power of capital and labor

But again factories machines division of labor

agricultural land and what was happening to it

So the big revolution that then happened 

and this by the way is not often taught in economics classes 

the big revolution that happened with the current system

of economic thinking that we have

which is called neoclassical economics

was that the logic completely changed

It changed in two ways

It changed from this focus on objective conditions to subjective ones

Let me explain what I mean by that

Objective in the way I just said

Subjective in the sense that all the attention went to

how individuals of different sorts make their decisions

OK so workers are maximizing their choices of leisure versus work

Consumers are maximizing their socalled utility

which is a proxy for happiness

and firms are maximizing their profits

And the idea behind this was that then we can aggregate this up

and we see what that turns into

which are these nice fancy supplyanddemand curves

which produce a price

an equilibrium price

It's an equilibrium price because we also added to it

a lot of Newtonian physics equations

where centers of gravity are very much part of the organizing principle

But the second point here is that that equilibrium price or prices

reveal value

So the revolution here is a change from objective to subjective

but also the logic is no longer one of what is value

how is it being determined

what is the reproductive potential of the economy

which then leads to a theory of price

but rather the reverse

a theory of price and exchange

which reveals value

Now this is a huge change

And it's not just an academic exercise as fascinating as that might be

It affects how we measure growth

It affects how we steer economies to produce more of some activities

less of others

how we also remunerate some activities more than others

And it also just kind of makes you think

you know are you happy to get out of bed if you're a value creator or not

and how is the price system itself if you aren't determining that

I mentioned it affects how we think about output

If we only include for example in GDP

those activities that have prices

all sorts of really weird things happen

Feminist economists and environmental economists

have actually written about this quite a bit

Let me give you some examples

If you marry your babysitter GDP will go down so do not do it
GDP
Do not be tempted to do this OK

Because an activity that perhaps was before being paid for is still being done

but is no longer paid

Laughter

If you pollute GDP goes up
GDP
Still don't do it but if you do it you'll help the economy

Why Because we have to actually pay someone to clean it
 
Now what's also really interesting is what happened to finance

in the financial sector in GDP
GDP
This also by the way is something I'm always surprised

that many economists don't know

Up until 

most of the financial sector was not even included in GDP
GDP
It was kind of indirectly perhaps not knowingly

still being seen through the eyes of the Physiocrats

as just kind of moving stuff around not actually producing anything new

So only those activities that had an explicit price were included

For example if you went to get a mortgage you were charged a fee

That went into GDP and the national income and product accounting
GDP
But for example net interest payments didn't

the difference between what banks were earning in interest

if they gave you a loan and what they were paying out for a deposit

That wasn't being included

And so the people doing the accounting started to look at some data

which started to show that the size of finance

and these net interest payments

were actually growing substantially

And they called this the banking problem

These were some people working inside actually the United Nations

in a group called the Systems of National [Accounts] SNA
[]
They called it the banking problem

like Oh my God this thing is huge and we're not even including it

So instead of stopping and actually making that Tableau Economique

or asking some of these fundamental questions

that also the classicals were asking about what is actually happening

the division of labor between different types of activities in the economy

they simply gave these net interest payments a name

So the commercial banks they called this financial intermediation

That went into the NIPA accounts

And the investment banks were called the risktaking activities

and that went in

In case I haven't explained this properly

that red line is showing how much quicker

financial intermediation as a whole was growing

compared to the rest of the economy the blue line industry

And so this was quite extraordinary

because what actually happened and what we know today

and there's different people writing about this

this data here is from the Bank of England

is that lots of what finance was actually doing

from the s and 's on

was basically financing itself

finance financing finance

And what I mean by that is finance insurance and real estate

In fact in the UK

something like between  and  percent of finance

finds its way into the real economy into industry

say into the energy sector into pharmaceuticals

into the IT sector
IT
but most of it goes back into that acronym FIRE
FIRE
finance insurance and real estate

It's very conveniently called FIRE

Now this is interesting because in fact

it's not to say that finance is good or bad

but the degree to which

by just having to give it a name

because it actually had an income that was being generated

as opposed to pausing and asking What is it actually doing 
 
that was a missed opportunity

Similarly in the real economy in industry itself what was happening

And this real focus on prices and also share prices

has created a huge problem of reinvestment

again this real attention that both the Physiocrats and the classicals had

to the degree to which the value that was being generated in the economy

was in fact being reinvested back in

And so what we have today is an ultrafinancialized industrial sector

where increasingly a share of the profits and the net income

are not actually going back into production

into human capital training into research and development

but just being siphoned out in terms of buying back your own shares

which boosts stock options which is in fact the way

that many executives are getting paid

And you know some share buybacks is absolutely fine

but this system is completely out of whack

These numbers that I'm showing you here

show that in the last  years  of the S and P  companies

have spent over four trillion on just buying back their shares

And what you see then if you aggregate this up at the macroeconomic level

so if we look at aggregate business investment

which is a percentage of GDP
GDP
you also see this falling level of business investment

And this is a problem

This by the way is a huge problem for skills and job creation

You might have heard there's lots of attention these days

to Are the robots taking our jobs

Well mechanization has for centuries actually taken jobs

but as long as profits were being reinvested back into production

then it didn't matter new jobs appeared

But this lack of reinvestment is in fact very dangerous

Similarly in the pharmaceutical industry for example how prices are set

it's quite interesting how it doesn't look at these objective conditions

of the collective way in which value is created in the economy

So in the sector where you have lots of different actors 

public private of course but also thirdsector organizations 

creating value

the way we actually measure value in this sector

is through the price system itself

Prices reveal value

So when recently

the price of an antibiotic went up by  percent overnight

and the CEO was asked How can you do this

People actually need that antibiotic

That's unfair

He said Well we have a moral imperative

to allow prices to go what the market will bear

completely dismissing the fact that in the US for example

the National Institutes of Health spent over  billion a year

on the medical research that actually leads to these drugs

So again a lack of attention to those objective conditions

and just allowing the price system itself to reveal the value

Now this is not just an academic exercise

as interesting as it may be

All this really matters [for] how we measure output

to how we steer the economy

to whether you feel that you're productive

to which sectors we end up helping supporting

and also making people feel proud to be part of

In fact going back to that quote

it's not surprising that Blankfein could say that

He was right

In the way that we actually measure production productivity

and value in the economy

of course Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive

They are in fact earning the most

The price of their labor is revealing their value

But this becomes tautological of course

And so there's a real need to rethink

We need to rethink how we're measuring output

and in fact there's some amazing experiments worldwide

In New Zealand for example they now have a gross national happiness indicator

In Bhutan also they're thinking about happiness and wellbeing indicators

But the problem is that we can't just be adding things in

We do have to pause

and I think this should be a moment for pause

given that we see so little has actually changed

since the financial crisis

to make sure that we are not also confusing

value extraction with value creation

so looking at what's included not just adding more

to make sure that we're not for example confusing rents with profits

Rents for the classicals was about unearned income

Today rents when they're talked about in economics

is just an imperfection towards a competitive price

that could be competed away if you take away some asymmetries

Second we of course can steer activities into what the classicals called

the production boundary

This should not be an usversusthem

big bad finance versus good other sectors

We could reform finance

There was a real lost opportunity in some ways after the crisis

We could have had the financial transaction tax

which would have rewarded longtermism over shorttermism

but we didn't decide to do that globally

We can We can change our minds
 
We can also set up new types of institutions

There's different types of for example public financial institutions worldwide

that are actually providing that patient longterm committed finance

that helps small firms grow that help infrastructure and innovation happen

But this shouldn't just be about output

This shouldn't just be about the rate of output

We should also as a society pause

and ask What value are we even creating

And I just want to end with the fact that this week we are celebrating

the th anniversary of the Moon landing

This required the public sector the private sector

to invest and innovate in all sorts of ways

not just around aeronautics

It included investment in areas like nutrition and materials

There were lots of actual mistakes that were done along the way

In fact what government did was it used its full power of procurement

for example to fuel those bottomup solutions

of which some failed

But are failures part of value creation

Or are they just mistakes

Or how do we actually also nurture the experimentation

the trial and error and error and error

Bell Labs which was the R and D laboratory of AT and T
ATTRD
actually came from an era where government was quite courageous

It actually asked AT and T that in order to maintain its monopoly status
ATT
it had to reinvest its profits back into the real economy

innovation

and innovation beyond telecoms

That was the history the early history of Bell Labs

So how we can get these new conditions around reinvestment

to collectively invest in new types of value

directed at some of the biggest challenges of our time

like climate change

This is a key question

But we should also ask ourselves

had there been a net present value calculation

or a costbenefit analysis done

about whether or not to even try to go to the Moon and back again

in a generation

we probably wouldn't have started

So thank God

because I'm an economist and I can tell you

value is not just price

Thank you

Applause

I am an ideas activist

That means I fight for ideas I believe in

to have their place in the sun

regardless of which side of the equator they were born

As well I should

I myself am from that part of the world

often euphemistically referred to as either the Global South

or the developing world

But let's be blunt about it

when we say those words what we really mean is the poor world 

those corners of the world with readymade containers

for the handmedown ideas of other places and other people

But I'm here to depart a little bit from the script

and to try and convince you

that these places are actually alive and bubbling with ideas

My real issue is Where do I even start

So maybe Egypt Alexandria

where we meet Rizwan

When he walks outside his souk

walks into a pharmacy for heart medicine

that can prevent the blood in his arteries from clotting

he confronts the fact that

despite a growing epidemic

that currently accounts for  percent of all deaths in Egypt

it is the medicines that can address these conditions

that counterfeiters ever the evil geniuses they are

have decided to target

Counterfeiters making knockoff medicines

Luckily for Rizwan

my team and I

working in partnership with the largest pharmaceutical company in Africa

have placed unique codes  think of them like onetime passwords 

on each pack of the bestselling heart medicine in Egypt

So when Rizwan buys heart medicine

he can key in these onetime passwords

to a tollfree short code

that we've set up on all the telecom companies in Egypt

for free

He gets a message  call it the message of life 

which reassures him

that this medicine is not one of the  percent of all medicines in Egypt

that are counterfeits

From the gorgeous banks of the Nile

we glide into the beautiful Rift Valley of Kenya

In Narok Town we meet Ole Lenku saltoftheearth fellow
NarokOle Lenku
When he walks into an agrodealer's shop

all he wants is certified and proper cabbage seeds

that if he were to plant them

will yield a harvest rich enough

that he can pay for the school fees of his children

That's all he wants

Unfortunately

by the reckoning of most international organizations

 percent of all the seeds sold in Eastern and Southern Africa

are of questionable quality

sometimes outrightly fake

Luckily for Ole

once again our team has been at work

and working with the leading agriculture regulator in Kenya

we've digitized the entire certification process

for seeds in that country

every seed  millet sorghum maize 

such that when Ole Lenku keys in a code on a packet of millet
Ole Lenku
he's able to retrieve a digital certificate

that assures him that the seed is properly certified

From Kenya we head to Noida in India

where the irrepressible Ambika
Ambika
is holding on very fast to her dream of becoming an elite athlete

safe in the knowledge that

because of our ingredients rating technology

she's not going to ingest something accidentally

which will mess up her doping tests

and kick her out of the sports she loves

Finally we alight in Ghana

my own home country

where another problem needs addressing 

the problem of undervaccination or poorquality vaccination

You see when you put some vaccines into the bloodstream of an infant

you are giving them a lifetime insurance

against dangerous diseases that can cripple them or kill them

Sometimes this is for a lifetime

The problem is that vaccines are delicate organisms really

and they need to be stored between two degrees and eight degrees

And if you don't do that they lose their potency

and they no longer confer the immunity

the child deserves

Working with computer vision scientists

we've converted simple markers on the vials of vaccines

into what you might regard as crude thermometers

So then these patterns change slowly over time in response to temperature

until they leave a distinct pattern on the surface of the vaccine

such that a nurse with a scan of the phone

can detect if the vaccine was stored properly in the right temperature

and therefore is still good for use

before administering this to the child 

literally securing the next generation

These are some of the solutions at work saving lives redeeming societies

in these parts of the world

But I would remind you

that there are powerful ideas behind them

and I'll recap a few

One that social trust is not the same as interpersonal trust

Two that the division between consumption and regulation

in an increasingly interdependent world

is no longer viable

And three that decentralized autonomy

regardless of what our blockchain enthusiasts in the West 

whom I respect a lot  say

are not as important as reinforcing social accountability feedback loops

These are some of the ideas

Now every time I go somewhere and I give this speech

and I make these comments and I provide these examples

people say If these ideas are so damn brilliant

why aren't they everywhere

I've never heard of them

I want to assure you

the reason why you have not heard of these ideas

is exactly the point I made in the beginning

And that is that there are parts of the world

whose good ideas simply don't scale

because of the latitude on which they were born

I call that mental latitude imperialism

Laughter

That really is the reason

But you may counter and say Well maybe it's an important problem

but it's sort of an obscure problem in parts of the world

Why do you want to globalize such problems

I mean they are better local

What if in response I told you

that actually underlying each of these problems that I've described

is a fundamental issue of the breakdown of trust

in markets and institutions

and that there's nothing more global more universal closer to you and I

than the problem of trust

For example a quarter of all the seafood marketed in the US is falsely labeled

So when you buy a tuna or salmon sandwich in Manhattan

you are eating something that could be banned for being toxic in Japan

Literally

Most of you have heard of a time when horsemeat was masquerading as beef

in burger patties in Europe

You have

What you don't know is that a good chunk of these fake meat patties

were also contaminated with cadmium which can damage your kidneys

This was Europe

Many of you are aware of plane crashes and you worry about plane crashes

because every now and then one of them intrudes into your consciousness

But I bet you don't know

that a single investigation uncovered one million counterfeit incidents

in the aeronautical supply chain in the US

So this is a global problem full stop

It's a global problem

The only reason we are not addressing it with the urgency it deserves

is that the best solutions

the most advanced solutions the most progressive solutions

are unfortunately in parts of the world where solutions don't scale

And that is why it is not surprising

that attempts to create this same verification models for pharmaceuticals

are now a decade behind in the USA and Europe

while it's already available in Nigeria

A decade and costing a hundred times more

And that is why when you walk into a Walgreens in New York
Walgreens
you cannot check the source of your medicine

but you can in Maiduguri in Northern Nigeria

That is the reality

Applause

That is the reality

Applause

So we go back to the issue of ideas

Remember solutions are merely packaged ideas

so it is the ideas that are most important

In a world where we marginalize the ideas of the Global South

we cannot create globally inclusive problemsolving models

Now you might say Well that's bad

but in such a world where we have so many other problems

do we need another cause

I say yes we need another cause

Actually that cause will surprise you the cause of intellectual justice

You say What Intellectual justice In a world of human rights abuses
  
And I explain this way

all the solutions to the other problems that affect us and confront us

need solutions

So you need the best ideas to address them

And that is why today I ask you

can we all give it one time for intellectual justice

Hello good day everyone

I'm from the Shinnecock Nation
Shinnecock
Tabutni to the Cahuilla peoples

whose land we gather on today

I was taught that water is alive

It can hear

it holds memories

And so I brought a water vessel up with me today

because I want it to hold the memories of our conversation today

Who gets legal rights

History has shown us some people but not others

In the United States Indigenous peoples like myself

were not citizens under the law until 

My Shinnecock ancestors pictured here
Shinnecock
were not citizens under the law

Then why do we claim to be nations governed by the rule of law

if some people are protected but not others

Because it remains one of the best ways to fight injustice

And as Indigenous people we know injustice

A dear friend mentor water walker

Nokomis Grandmother Josephine Mandaminba
NokomisJosephine Mandaminba
she told me of a prophecy that comes from her people

the Anishinaabe of the Midewiwin Society
MidewiwinAnishinaabe
And in that prophecy

she told me that it tells of a day that will come

where an ounce of water costs more than an ounce of gold

When she told me that prophecy I sat for a moment

and I thought about all of the injustices we see in our world today

the water crises we see in our world today

and I said Nokomis Grandmother
Nokomis
I feel like we are already in that time of prophecy

And she looked back at me directly

and she said

So what are you going to do about it

That's why I'm here with you today

because I believe that one of the many solutions

to solving the many water injustices we see in our world today

is recognizing that water is a living relation

and granting it the legal personhood it deserves

So to do so we need to transform the way in which we value water

We have to start to think about how do we connect to water

Usually someone might ask you

What is water

and you would respond with Rain ocean lake river

H liquid
H
You might even understand the sacred essentiality of water

and say that water is life

But what if I asked you instead

Who is water

In the same way that I might ask you Who is your grandmother

Who is your sister

That type of orientation

fundamentally transforms the way in which we think about water

transforms the way in which we make decisions

about how we might protect water

protect it in the way that you would protect your grandmother

your mother your sister your aunties

That is the type of transformation

that we need if we are going to address the many water crises we see

in our world today

these harrowing water crises

that have streamed across our digital devices

in countdowns to Day Zero

the point at which municipal water supplies are shut off

Places like Cape Town South Africa

where in 

residents were limited to twominute showers

and  gallons of water per day per person

or just this past summer where the mismanagement of water

led the streets of Chennai

to be lined with thousands of plastic water jugs

as residents waited hours for water tankers

to deliver water first by rail then by truck

to meet their daily needs

Or even here in the United States

one of the most developed nations in the world

Today Flint Michigan still does not have clean water

But you are likely unfamiliar with these water crises

such as Neskantaga First Nation in Northern Ontario Canada

where residents have been on a boil water advisory since 

Or Grassy Narrows First Nation
Grassy Narrows
which for decades has been dealing with water contamination

from the paper mill industry

and where a recent study found

that nearly  percent of the Indigenous population

has some form of mercury poisoning

causing severe health complications

Or even among the Navajo Nation

Pictured here is the Animas River on an early morning in 
Animas
prior to the Gold King Mine spill

After the spill leaked millions of hazardous mine waste

into the river system

this was it later that day

Today the Navajo Nation and the Din People

and the river itself are still trying to recover from contamination

Or even right here in Palm Springs California

where the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians

has been fighting for decades to protect groundwater from exploitation

so that future generations

can not only live but thrive in their homelands

as they have since time immemorial

You see a recent study by DIGDEEP and the US Water Alliance
DIGDEEP
found that race in the United States

is the strongest predictor of water and sanitation access

and that for us

as Native American people

we are the group most likely to have access issues

as it comes to water and sanitation

So as an Indigenous legal scholar and scientist

I believe that many of these water injustices

are the result of the Western legal system's failure to recognize

the legal personhood of water

And so we must ask ourselves 

who is justice for

Humanity alone

We've granted legal personhood to corporations

In the US the Supreme Court found in Citizens United

that a corporation was a person

with similar protections under the Constitution

such as freedom of speech

and applied similar reasoning in Hobby Lobby
Hobby Lobby
finding that a corporation had the right to freedom of religion

in defense against the implementation of the Affordable Care Act

for its employees

Now these are controversial cases

and as a Shinnecock woman and a legal scholar

they make me question the moral compass of the Western world

where you can grant legal personhood to a corporation

but not nature

You see legal personhood grants us the ability

to be visible in a court of law

and to have our voices heard as a person protected under the law

And so if you can grant that to a corporation

why not the Great Lakes

Why not the Mississippi River

Why not the many waterways across our planet

that we all depend on to survive

We know we are in a global climate crisis

but globally our waters are also threatened

and we are facing a global water crisis

and if we want to address these crises in our lifetime

we need to change

We need to fundamentally transform the way in which we value water

And this is not something new for us as Indigenous peoples

Our Indigenous legal systems have a foundational principle

of understanding our nonhuman relations

as being living and protected under our laws

And even for the Western world

environmental legal theorists

have argued for the rights of nature since the s

But we need to do better

We need to change

And we need to grant legal personhood to water

because it affords the following rights and protections

It grants water the right to exist

flourish and naturally evolve

and most of all it protects the water from us

from human beings that would do it harm

from humancaused climatechange impacts

from pollutants

and from manmade contamination

Moreover it reverses the accepted hierarchy

of humanity's domination over nature

As human beings on this planet

we are not superior to other beings on this planet

We are not superior to the water itself

We have to learn how to be good stewards again

We often imagine that the world is filled with infinite water

In fact it's not

This planet Ohke Mother Earth

has very finite freshwater resources

Currently nearly two billion people

live in countries experiencing high water stress

It is also estimated that by 

up to  million people could be displaced worldwide

due to water scarcity

We have to address this crisis

And so it's time for us to change

We have to transform the way in which we value water

And we can do that

We can learn to be good stewards again

We can create laws through which we grant legal personhood to water

We can start to honor the original treaties

between Indigenous peoples and nonIndigenous peoples

for water protection

We can appoint guardians for the water

that ensure the water's rights are always protected

We can also develop waterquality standards

that have a holistic approach

that ensure the wellbeing of the water before our human needs

And moreover we can work to dismantle exclusive property ownership over water

And there are amazing successful examples of this around the world

The Whanganui River in Aotearoa in New Zealand

and the Ganges River in India

were both granted legal personhood in 

And even this year

the residents of the city of Toledo

recognized the legal personality of Lake Erie

And right here in California

the Yurok Tribe granted legal personhood to the Klamath River
Yurok
You see I imagine a world where we value water

as a living relation

where we work to restore our connection to water

As women we are water carriers

We nurture water in our wombs for nine months

It's the first medicine that each of us as human beings

is exposed to

See we are all born as human beings with a natal connection to water

but somewhere along the way we lost that connection

and we have to work to restore it

Because I imagine a world

in which water is healthy and ecosystems are thriving

I imagine a world

where each of us takes up our right of responsibility

as water citizens

and protects water

So in the words of Nokomis

what are you going to do about it

What are you going to do for the water

Well you can call your local politician

You can go to a town meeting

You can advocate for granting legal personhood to water

You can be like the residents of the city of Toledo

and build from the grass roots

and craft your own legislation if the politicians won't write it

recognizing legal personality of water

You can learn about the Indigenous lands and waters that you now occupy

and the Indigenous legal systems that still govern them

And most of all you can connect to water

You can restore that connection

Go to the water closest to your home

and find out why it is threatened

But most of all if you do anything

I ask that you make a promise to yourself

that each day you will ask

What have I done for the water today

If we are able to fulfill that promise

I believe we can create a bold and brilliant world

where future generations are able to form

the same relationship to water that we have been privileged to have

where all communities of human and nonhuman relations

have water to live

because water is life

I think that at the time

Catwoman had a really cool pair of glasses

in the Batman series that was on television

and I wanted to be cool like her

It didn't occur to me

that glasses were really a medical device

upbeat music

When light rays reflect off an object

and enter the eye through the cornea

your retina converts this light into electrical impulses

that are sent to the brain which interprets the impulses

and allows you to understand what you're seeing

Eyeglasses help you see

The earliest forms of eye gear

can be traced back  years

Cultures that needed to adapt to climates that were snowy

created ice shields and they were made of bone

and animal hides

They had small slits for people to see through

but no lenses

The first vision aid was called a reading stone

and was invented over  years ago

It's not exactly clear who invented the first eyeglasses

but many people attribute it to the Italians

Early versions of eyeglasses were called rivet spectacles

They were two magnifying glasses

that were hinged together at the ridge of the nose

It took some time for eyeglasses

to land on the perfect design

They didn't really have sides

which are also called temples or arms

until about the th century

Modern day eyeglasses feature a pair of rims

that hold corrective lenses

a bridge that connects the rims

sides that slide behind the ears

hinges that connect the sides to the frames

and on some glasses a pair of temple tips

for behindtheear comfort

In American culture

th Century cinema helped popularize eyeglasses

Audiences would see glamorous actresses and actors

donning glasses to take on a different persona

Sometimes a pair of glasses became popularized

by the actual person that was wearing them

and then that personality trait

was projected into the actual device

You have the aviator glasses

which showed a forwardthinking adventurous type of person

Glasses with heavy frames

signified intelligence or nerdiness

Wayfarers signified this kind of nerdy punk

the outlaw the misfit

Glasses have become so popular as a fashion device

that some people actually don glasses

without a prescription lens at all

because they want to portray

a certain attribute about themselves

Glasses are a lifeline to people

People that can't see well enough to drive

well enough to cook well enough to read

rely on glasses for maintaining their lives

And there's lots of other objects in our society

that have been created to help overcome

various physical obstacles

and it's only the eyeglasses that have catapulted

to that fashion statement

Wouldn't it be wonderful if anything that we use

any device that we've invented to help our humanity

could also be elevated in the same way

Now I know it might be easy to think

that microbes are bad

especially for infants

but research has in fact proven the opposite

And the truth might be a little bit more complex

but it's actually way more interesting

It seems that we need microbes

to be programmed for good health

but not just any microbes

we need the right combination

We succeed best with the little microbial bodies

we have adapted to coexist with during evolution

And I guess it won't surprise you

to learn that we start acquiring that right combination right at birth

Well at least some of us do

Babies born by Csection and babies born vaginally

aren't the same

when it comes to microbial start to life

and after birth there are countless different early life events

and circumstances

that further modulate the way the gut microbiota is developing

such as the medications that might be prescribed for the infant or the mother

number of pets and siblings in the family

as well as level of hygiene at home

and in this case it's actually better

if it's not that perfectly clean all the time

And also nutrition both mothers and infants

All of these events and circumstances play a huge role

in the gut microbial development

and that has a huge impact on the lifelong health of that baby

And I'm not talking about small health implications here

I'm talking about the big stuff

Microbes we acquire or do not acquire

affect our likelihood of developing diseases like obesity diabetes

and even some cancers

Since many of these early life events I just listed

are such that we cannot affect them

they are inevitable

for example Csections have been invented to save lives
C
and they do that daily

and most medications are prescribed for a valid reason

especially for infants and so on

That is why we have to learn

how to protect the health of these babies

after the occurrence of such early life events

that might disrupt their gut microbiota development

I work as a researcher

and as a technical lead of an infant health platform

and the question I'm trying to find a solution to every day at work

and the same question I'm aiming to answer in this talk

is how can we make sure

that all babies get the same shot at lifelong health

no matter how they're born or what early life events they encounter

Seems like a noble cause right

Great

So let's figure this out

To begin remember how I said that we need the right combination of microbes

Well to get that combination right

we need to receive those microbes that inhabit our bodies

in a certain order

You can think of it like a colonization march

The very early microbes that inhabit our bodies first

change the environment in the infant's gut

so that the next microbes are able to move in

kind of like the first invaders

come in first and set up the infrastructure

for the other settlers to build upon

Now if babies are born via Csection

that early phase of colonization is greatly altered

because instead of vaginal fecal and skin bacteria of the mother

mainly only skin bacteria enter the infant gut

And that sets that colonization march to a totally different tone

and simply because that's different to what we've adapted to during evolution

that might cause some health disadvantages for Csectionborn babies later on

We can take weight development as an example here

It has been already shown in several studies

that gut microbiota composition

is associated to weight

as well as the likelihood of developing diseases

like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases

But now there are some indications

that you could already at infancy

see from a fecal sample of a baby

some microbes missing from those individuals

who will later on develop to be obese or overweight

It has also been shown that those same microbes

might be missing from babies who are born by Csection

or who are predisposed to heavy loads of antibiotics in early life

And to kind of close this loop

it has also been shown in some research

that babies born by Csection

or are prescribed with many many antibiotics early in life

are more likely to be obese or overweight even by  percent

which is a lot

Now I know you might be thinking at this point

that oh no I just had a Csection or I was born via Csection

or my child had the antibiotics

But I want you to not worry

If these microbes are missing

or are lost for any reason

they can be acquired later

but the baby just needs a little help with that

One thing that has already for some time been known to help is breastfeeding

Breast milk is kind of miraculous

in addition to containing nutrients for the baby

it seems to contain food for the good microbes as well

That's great for a breastfed baby

but we all know that all babies are not breastfed

So what could we do to ensure that also those babies who are not breastfed

could restore their microbiota development

after encountering those disruptive early life events

that might disrupt their gut microbiota development

And now we get to the actual solution part of this talk

The research in this field has been taking giant steps lately

First it was understood that if there are some microbes missing

they can be ingested

We call the good microbes when they are ingested probiotics

and probiotics have been tested

in several clinical trials during the years

also in infants with great effects

such as reducing their risk of eczema later in life

Now a second revolution was realized

when the eyes of researchers were turned to breast milk

That was logical as like I mentioned

it was already known that breastfeeding is able to support the healthy development

of gut microbiota

There were these particles in breast milk

that were found already in the s

called human milk oligosaccharides

but their function remained a mystery

for decades and decades after their initial discovery

They were really puzzling for researchers

as they are really abundant in human milk

They are actually the thirdlargest group of solids

but they are not digestible by humans not even infants

So why would mothers synthesize something to breast milk

use their resources to put something there

that is not utilizable by the infant

Usually nature does not work that way

Right

So it was quite a revelation when it was finally understood

what's the role of these particles

and that it is to selectively feed the microbes that are best for infants

and that way to affect the infant health

There are over a hundred of different HMO structures
HMO
and nowadays we are able to synthesize some of them also in the lab

and that enables us to package them up

with probiotics for children and infants

who are not able to receive them from breast milk

to restore their microbiota

after encountering disruptive early life events

And that is the solution

As a researcher I must say at this point

that research in this field is still ongoing

and a lot of work remains to be done

That's a favorite sentence of us scientists

But we are taking steps towards understanding better and better

which are the key missing microbes in various situations

and what HMOs we should package with which probiotics
HMO
to help restore the microbiota of that particular baby in that particular case

What I wish you to remember from this talk

is that yes vaginally born breastfed baby has the microbiota

we have evolved to adapt to

but in cases where that is not possible

there are means to reduce the negative health consequences

Lastly I wish you to imagine a world for a while

a world where there would be such a health care system

that when you take your baby to a health care check

they would routinely monitor the gut microbiota development of that baby

and if any disruptions would be noted

a tailormade product to restore the microbiota

would be prescribed

I mean how wonderful would that be

if the onset of any chronic diseases would be extremely rare

because of this preemptive health care system

Can you imagine such a world

Do you believe that that kind of future would be possible

I do

I believe in that future and I want to contribute

in the unfolding of that future

a future in which each baby has an equal starting point for life

to be programmed for lifelong health

Thank you

We are all atomically connected

Fundamentally universally

But what does that mean

I'm an astrophysicist and as such

it is my responsibility to trace the cosmic history

of every single one of your atoms

In fact I would say

that one of the greatest achievements of modern astronomy

is the understanding of how our atoms were actually put together

While hydrogen and helium were made

during the first two minutes of the big bang

the origin of heavy elements

such as the iron in your blood the oxygen we're breathing

the silicone in your computers

lies in the life cycle of stars

Nuclear reactions take lighter elements and transform them into heavier ones

and that causes stars to shine

and ultimately explode

therefore enriching the universe with these heavy elements

So without stellar death

there would be no oxygen

or other elements heavier than hydrogen and helium

and therefore there would be no life

There are more atoms in our bodies

than stars in the universe

And these atoms are extremely durable

The origins of our atoms

can be traceable to stars that manufactured them in their interiors

and exploded them all across the Milky Way

billions of years ago

And I should know this

because I am indeed a certified stellar mortician

Laughter

And today I want to take you on a journey that starts in a supernova explosion

and ends with the air that we're breathing right now

So what is our body made of

Ninetysix percent consists of only four elements

hydrogen carbon oxygen and nitrogen

Now the main character of this cosmic tale is oxygen

Not only is the vast majority of our bodies made of oxygen

but oxygen is the one element fighting to protect life on earth

The vast majority of oxygen in the universe

was indeed produced over the entire history of the universe

in these supernova explosions

These supernova explosions signal the demise of very massive stars

And for a brilliant month

one supernova explosion can be brighter than an entire galaxy

containing billions of stars

That is truly remarkable

That is because massive stars burn brighter

and have a spectacular death compared to other stars

Nuclear fusion is really the lifeblood of all stars

including the sun

and as a result is the root source of all the energy on earth

You can think of stars as these fusion factories

which are powered by smashing atoms together

in their hot and dense interiors

Now stars like our sun

which are relatively small

burn hydrogen into helium

but heavier stars of about eight times the mass of the sun

continue this burning cycle

even after they exhausted their helium in their cores

So at this point

the massive star is left with a carbon core

which as you know is the building block of life

This carbon core continues to collapse

and as a result the temperature increases

which allows further nuclear reactions to take place

and carbon then burns into oxygen

into neon silicon sulphur

and ultimately iron

And iron is the end

Why

Because iron is the most bound nuclei in the universe

which means that we cannot extract energy by burning iron

So when the entire core of the massive star is made of iron

it's run out of fuel

And that's an incredibly bad day for a star

Laughter

Without fuel it cannot generate heat

and therefore gravity has won the battle

The iron core has no other choice but to collapse

reaching incredibly high densities

Think of  million tons

reduced to a space the size of a sugar cube

At these extreme high densities the core actually resists collapse

and as a result

all of this infalling material bounces off the core

And this dramatic bounce

which happens in a fraction of a second or so

is responsible for ejecting the rest of the star in all directions

ultimately forming a supernova explosion

So sadly from the perspective of an astrophysicist

the conditions in the centers of these exploding stars

cannot be recreated in a laboratory

Laughter

Now thankfully for humanity we're not able to do that

Laughter

But what does that mean

That means that as astrophysicists

we have to rely on sophisticated computer simulations

in order to understand these complex phenomena

These simulations can be used to really understand how gas behaves

under such extreme conditions

And can be used to answer fundamental questions

like What ultimately disrupted the massive star

How is it that this implosion can be reversed into an explosion

There's a huge amount of debate in the field

but we all agree that neutrinos

which are these elusive elementary particles

play a crucial role

Yeah

I'm about to show you one of those simulations

So neutrinos are produced in huge numbers once the core collapses

And in fact

they are responsible for transferring the energy in this core

Like thermal radiation in a heater

neutrinos pump energy into the core

increasing the possibility of disrupting the star

In fact for about a fraction of a second

neutrinos pump so much energy

that the pressure increases high enough that a shock wave is produced

and the shock wave goes and disrupts the entire star

And it is in that shock wave where elements are produced

So thank you neutrinos

Laughter

Supernovas shine bright

and for a brief period of time

they radiate more energy than the sun will in its entire lifetime

That point of light that you see there

which was certainly not there before

burns like a beacon

clearly indicating the position where the massive star has died

In a galaxy like our own Milky Way

we estimate that about once every  years

a massive star dies

This implies that somewhere in the universe

there's a supernova explosion every second or so

And thankfully for astronomers

some of them are actually found relatively close to earth

Various civilizations recorded these supernova explosions

long before the telescope was invented

The most famous of all of them

is probably the supernova explosion that gave rise to the Crab Nebula

Yeah

Korean and Chinese astronomers recorded this supernova in 

as did almost certainly Native Americans

This supernova happened about  lightyears away from earth

And it was so incredibly bright

that astronomers could see it during the day

And it was visible to the naked eye for about two years in the night sky

Fast forward  years or so later and what do we see

We see these filaments that were blasted by the explosion

moving at  miles per second

These filaments are essential for us to understand

how massive stars die

The image that you see there

was assembled by the Hubble Space Telescope

over a span of three months

And it is incredibly important to astronomers

because it ultimately carries the chemical legacy

of the star that exploded

The orange filaments that you see there are the tattered remains of the star

and are made primarily of hydrogen

while the blue and red filaments that you see

are the freshly synthesized oxygen

So studying supernova remnants like the Crab Nebula

allowed astronomers to firmly conclude

that the vast majority of oxygen on earth was produced by supernova explosions

over the history of the universe

And we can estimate

that in order to assemble all the atoms of oxygen in our body

it took on the order of a  million supernova

So every bit of you or at least the majority of it

came from one of these supernova explosions

So now you may be wondering

how is it that these atoms

that were generated in such extreme conditions

ultimately took residence in our body

So I want you to follow the thought experiment

Imagine that we're in the Milky Way and a supernova happens

It blasted tons and tons of oxygen atoms

almost into empty space

A few of them were able to be assembled in a cloud

Now  billion years ago

something unsettled that cloud and caused it to collapse

forming the sun in its center and the solar system

So the sun the planets and life on earth

depend on this beautiful cycle

of stellar birth stellar death and stellar rebirth

And this continues the recycling of atoms in the universe

And as a result astronomy and chemistry are intimately connected

We are life forms that have evolved to inhale the waste products of plants

But now you know

that we also inhale the waste products of supernova explosions

Laughter

So take a moment inhale

An oxygen atom has just gone into your body

It is certain that that oxygen [atom]
[]
remembers that it was in the interior of a star

and it was probably manufactured by a supernova explosion

This atom may have traveled the entire solar system

until it splashed on earth

long before reaching you

When we breathe

we use hundreds of liters of oxygen every day

So I'm incredibly lucky to be standing in front of this beautiful audience

but I'm actually stealing your oxygen atoms

Laughter

And because I'm speaking to you

I'm giving you some of them back that once resided in me

So breathing yeah

participates in this beautiful exchange of atoms

And you can then ask

Well how many atoms in our body once belonged to Frida Kahlo

Laughter

About  of them

 more probably belonged to Marie Curie

 more to Sally Ride

or whoever you want to think of

So breathing is not only filling our lungs with cosmic history

but with human history

I would like to end my talk by sharing a myth

that is very close to my heart

A myth from the Chichimeca culture

which is a very powerful Mesoamerican culture

And the Chichimecas believe

that our essence was assembled in the heavens

And on its journey towards us

it actually fragmented into tons of different pieces

So my abuelo used to say

One of the reasons you feel incomplete

is because you are missing your pieces

Laughter

But don't be fooled by that

You've been given an incredible opportunity of growth

Why

Because it's not like those pieces were scattered on earth

and you have to go and pick them up

No those pieces fell into other people

And only by sharing them you will become more complete

Yes during your life

there's going to be individuals that have these huge pieces

that make you feel whole

But in your quest of being complete

you have to treasure and share every single one of those pieces

Sounds a lot like the story of oxygen to me

Laughter

Which started in the heavens in a supernova explosion

and continues today

within the confines of our humanity

Our atoms in our body have embarked on an epic odyssey

with time spans from billions of years to mere centuries

all leading to you

all of you

witnesses of the universe

Thank you

So on April  of 

the Associated Press put out the following tweet on Twitter
Associated PressTwitter
It said Breaking news

Two explosions at the White House

and Barack Obama has been injured
  
This tweet was retweeted  times in less than five minutes

and it went viral thereafter

Now this tweet wasn't real news put out by the Associated Press

In fact it was false news or fake news

that was propagated by Syrian hackers

that had infiltrated the Associated Press Twitter handle
Associated PressTwitter
Their purpose was to disrupt society but they disrupted much more

Because automated trading algorithms

immediately seized on the sentiment on this tweet

and began trading based on the potential

that the president of the United States had been injured or killed

in this explosion

And as they started tweeting

they immediately sent the stock market crashing

wiping out  billion dollars in equity value in a single day

Robert Mueller special counsel prosecutor in the United States

issued indictments against three Russian companies

and  Russian individuals

on a conspiracy to defraud the United States

by meddling in the  presidential election

And what this indictment tells as a story

is the story of the Internet Research Agency

the shadowy arm of the Kremlin on social media

During the presidential election alone

the Internet Agency's efforts

reached  million people on Facebook in the United States
Facebook
issued three million individual tweets

and  hours' worth of YouTube content
YouTube
All of which was fake 

misinformation designed to sow discord in the US presidential election

A recent study by Oxford University

showed that in the recent Swedish elections

one third of all of the information spreading on social media

about the election

was fake or misinformation

In addition these types of socialmedia misinformation campaigns

can spread what has been called genocidal propaganda

for instance against the Rohingya in Burma

triggering mob killings in India

We studied fake news

and began studying it before it was a popular term

And we recently published the largestever longitudinal study

of the spread of fake news online

on the cover of Science in March of this year

We studied all of the verified true and false news stories

that ever spread on Twitter

from its inception in  to 

And when we studied this information

we studied verified news stories

that were verified by six independent factchecking organizations

So we knew which stories were true

and which stories were false

We can measure their diffusion

the speed of their diffusion

the depth and breadth of their diffusion

how many people become entangled in this information cascade and so on

And what we did in this paper

was we compared the spread of true news to the spread of false news

And here's what we found

We found that false news diffused further faster deeper

and more broadly than the truth

in every category of information that we studied

sometimes by an order of magnitude

And in fact false political news was the most viral

It diffused further faster deeper and more broadly

than any other type of false news

When we saw this

we were at once worried but also curious

Why

Why does false news travel so much further faster deeper

and more broadly than the truth

The first hypothesis that we came up with was

Well maybe people who spread false news have more followers or follow more people

or tweet more often

or maybe they're more often 'verified' users of Twitter with more credibility
Twitter
or maybe they've been on Twitter longer
Twitter
So we checked each one of these in turn

And what we found was exactly the opposite

Falsenews spreaders had fewer followers

followed fewer people were less active

less often verified

and had been on Twitter for a shorter period of time

And yet

false news was  percent more likely to be retweeted than the truth

controlling for all of these and many other factors

So we had to come up with other explanations

And we devised what we called a novelty hypothesis

So if you read the literature

it is well known that human attention is drawn to novelty

things that are new in the environment

And if you read the sociology literature

you know that we like to share novel information

It makes us seem like we have access to inside information

and we gain in status by spreading this kind of information

So what we did was we measured the novelty of an incoming true or false tweet

compared to the corpus of what that individual had seen

in the  days prior on Twitter

But that wasn't enough because we thought to ourselves

Well maybe false news is more novel in an informationtheoretic sense

but maybe people don't perceive it as more novel

So to understand people's perceptions of false news

we looked at the information and the sentiment

contained in the replies to true and false tweets

And what we found

was that across a bunch of different measures of sentiment 

surprise disgust fear sadness

anticipation joy and trust 

false news exhibited significantly more surprise and disgust

in the replies to false tweets

And true news exhibited significantly more anticipation

joy and trust

in reply to true tweets

The surprise corroborates our novelty hypothesis

This is new and surprising and so we're more likely to share it

At the same time there was congressional testimony

in front of both houses of Congress in the United States

looking at the role of bots in the spread of misinformation

So we looked at this too 

we used multiple sophisticated botdetection algorithms

to find the bots in our data and to pull them out

So we pulled them out we put them back in

and we compared what happens to our measurement

And what we found was that yes indeed

bots were accelerating the spread of false news online

but they were accelerating the spread of true news

at approximately the same rate

Which means bots are not responsible

for the differential diffusion of truth and falsity online

We can't abdicate that responsibility

because we humans are responsible for that spread

Now everything that I have told you so far

unfortunately for all of us

is the good news

The reason is because it's about to get a whole lot worse

And two specific technologies are going to make it worse

We are going to see the rise of a tremendous wave of synthetic media

Fake video fake audio that is very convincing to the human eye

And this will powered by two technologies

The first of these is known as generative adversarial networks

This is a machinelearning model with two networks

a discriminator

whose job it is to determine whether something is true or false

and a generator

whose job it is to generate synthetic media

So the synthetic generator generates synthetic video or audio

and the discriminator tries to tell Is this real or is this fake

And in fact it is the job of the generator

to maximize the likelihood that it will fool the discriminator

into thinking the synthetic video and audio that it is creating

is actually true

Imagine a machine in a hyperloop

trying to get better and better at fooling us

This combined with the second technology

which is essentially the democratization of artificial intelligence to the people

the ability for anyone

without any background in artificial intelligence

or machine learning

to deploy these kinds of algorithms to generate synthetic media

makes it ultimately so much easier to create videos

The White House issued a false doctored video

of a journalist interacting with an intern who was trying to take his microphone

They removed frames from this video

in order to make his actions seem more punchy

And when videographers and stuntmen and women

were interviewed about this type of technique

they said Yes we use this in the movies all the time

to make our punches and kicks look more choppy and more aggressive

They then put out this video

and partly used it as justification

to revoke Jim Acosta the reporter's press pass

from the White House

And CNN had to sue to have that press pass reinstated
CNN
There are about five different paths that I can think of that we can follow

to try and address some of these very difficult problems today

Each one of them has promise

but each one of them has its own challenges

The first one is labeling

Think about it this way

when you go to the grocery store to buy food to consume

it's extensively labeled

You know how many calories it has

how much fat it contains 

and yet when we consume information we have no labels whatsoever

What is contained in this information

Is the source credible

Where is this information gathered from

We have none of that information

when we are consuming information

That is a potential avenue but it comes with its challenges

For instance who gets to decide in society what's true and what's false

Is it the governments

Is it Facebook

Is it an independent consortium of factcheckers

And who's checking the factcheckers

Another potential avenue is incentives

We know that during the US presidential election

there was a wave of misinformation that came from Macedonia

that didn't have any political motive

but instead had an economic motive

And this economic motive existed

because false news travels so much farther faster

and more deeply than the truth

and you can earn advertising dollars as you garner eyeballs and attention

with this type of information

But if we can depress the spread of this information

perhaps it would reduce the economic incentive

to produce it at all in the first place

Third we can think about regulation

and certainly we should think about this option

In the United States currently

we are exploring what might happen if Facebook and others are regulated
Facebook
While we should consider things like regulating political speech

labeling the fact that it's political speech

making sure foreign actors can't fund political speech

it also has its own dangers

For instance Malaysia just instituted a sixyear prison sentence

for anyone found spreading misinformation

And in authoritarian regimes

these kinds of policies can be used to suppress minority opinions

and to continue to extend repression

The fourth possible option is transparency

We want to know how do Facebook's algorithms work
Facebook
How does the data combine with the algorithms

to produce the outcomes that we see

We want them to open the kimono

and show us exactly the inner workings of how Facebook is working
Facebook
And if we want to know social media's effect on society

we need scientists researchers

and others to have access to this kind of information

But at the same time

we are asking Facebook to lock everything down
Facebook
to keep all of the data secure

So Facebook and the other social media platforms
Facebook
are facing what I call a transparency paradox

We are asking them at the same time

to be open and transparent and simultaneously secure

This is a very difficult needle to thread

but they will need to thread this needle

if we are to achieve the promise of social technologies

while avoiding their peril

The final thing that we could think about is algorithms and machine learning

Technology devised to root out and understand fake news how it spreads

and to try and dampen its flow

Humans have to be in the loop of this technology

because we can never escape

that underlying any technological solution or approach

is a fundamental ethical and philosophical question

about how do we define truth and falsity

to whom do we give the power to define truth and falsity

and which opinions are legitimate

which type of speech should be allowed and so on

Technology is not a solution for that

Ethics and philosophy is a solution for that

Nearly every theory of human decision making

human cooperation and human coordination

has some sense of the truth at its core

But with the rise of fake news

the rise of fake video

the rise of fake audio

we are teetering on the brink of the end of reality

where we cannot tell what is real from what is fake

And that's potentially incredibly dangerous

We have to be vigilant in defending the truth

against misinformation

With our technologies with our policies

and perhaps most importantly

with our own individual responsibilities

decisions behaviors and actions

Thank you very much

In June of 

I volunteered with a group at a local food pantry

on the south side of my home city

in Atlanta Georgia

It was a Friday afternoon

the day of their weekly food giveaway

And as I drove up

I saw people beginning to arrive

many with their rolling carts in tow

prepared to receive their food supply for the week

As I was walking in the door there were about  people outside

waiting in line

And I was so excited

because there are very few things I enjoy more than giving back

But then as I entered the room where the volunteer meeting was taking place

I immediately realized

we weren't about to give these people any real meals

We were essentially just giving them food

I took my place on the assembly line where  get this 

I was in charge of making sure that the Weight Watchers Ding Dongs

made it into every family's bag

As the bags started to come around

I'm thinking to myself

What on earth are we doing here

Each bag contained two ounce diet Snapples

a gallon of barbecue sauce

a bag of kettle potato chips

a box of superheroshaped vegetableenriched macaroni noodles

a box of belVita breakfast bars

a can of refried beans

a can of sweet peas

a miniature can of corn

I can't forget about those Ding Dongs

and french fried green onions

you know the kind that go on top of a green bean casserole

And that was it

We made over a hundred of those bags that day

and people indeed stood in line to receive one

But a feeling came over me

I felt bad and a little angry

It was like how could I even feel good about the work that I was doing

when I knew for a fact that not one meal was to come

from the food we had just given to over  families

I mean who wants to have a meal with barbecue sauce and Ding Dongs

Laughter

And the reality is

I've been part of this process all my life

I've participated in food drives

I've collected cans since I was a kid

I've donated in the grocery store more times than I can count

I've volunteered at shelters I've worked in food pantries

and I'm sure like me so many of you have too

In  I even created a popup restaurant

called Sunday Soul

And I rented tables and chairs and linens

and I printed out menus

and I took these experiences to alleyways

underneath bridges and in parks

to allow people that were experiencing homelessness

to dine with dignity

So I've invested in this fight for quite some time

In almost every major US city

the food bank is viewed as a beloved community institution

Corporations send volunteers down on a weekly basis

to sort through food items and make boxes of food for the needy

And can drives 

they warm the hearts of schools and office buildings that participate

and fill the shelves of food banks and food pantries across the nation

This is how we work to end hunger

And what I've come to realize

is that we are doing hunger wrong

We are doing the same things

over and over and over again

and expecting a different end result

We've created a cycle

that keeps people dependent on food banks and pantries on a monthly basis

for food that is often not wellbalanced

and certainly doesn't provide them with a healthy meal

In the US our approach to doing good

or what we call charity

has actually hindered us from making real progress

We're educating the world on how many people are food insecure

There are television commercials

billboards

massive donations

the engagement of some of our biggest celebrities in the fight

But the everpresent reality is that

even with all of this work

millions of people are still going hungry

And we can do better

Globally  million people are hungry

That's one in nine people on this planet

And here in the United States

nearly  million people experience hunger every single year

including more than  million children

that go to bed hungry every night

Yet we're wasting more food than ever before 

more than  billion pounds a year

to be exact

The EPA estimates that food waste has more than doubled

between  and 

and now accounts for  percent of everything in our landfills

And as this food sits it gradually rots

and produces harmful methane gas

a leading contributor to global climate change

We have the waste of the food itself

the waste of all the money associated with producing this nowwasted food

and the waste of labor with all of the above

And then there's the social inequity

between people who really need food and can't get it

and people who have too much and simply throw it away

All of this made me realize that hunger was not an issue of scarcity

but rather a matter of logistics

So in  I set out to end hunger using technology

After all food delivery apps had begun to explode on the scene

and I thought surely we can reverseengineer this technology

and get food from businesses like restaurants and grocery stores

and into the hands of people in need

I believe that technology and innovation

have the power to solve real problems

especially hunger

So in  I created an app

that would inventory everything that a business sells

and make it super easy for them to donate this excess food

that would typically go to waste at the end of the night

All the user has to do now is click on an item

tell us how many they have to donate

and our platform calculates the weight and the tax value

of those items at time of donation

We then connect with local drivers in the shared economy

to get this food picked up and delivered directly to the doors

of nonprofit organizations and people in need

I provided the data and the analytics

to help businesses reduce food waste at the source

by letting them know the items that they waste repeatedly

on a regular basis

and they even saved millions of dollars

Our mission was simple

feed more waste less

And by  our clients included the world's busiest airport

Atlanta's HartsfieldJackson

and we were working with brands and corporations

like Hormel ChickfilA and Papa John's
HormelChickfilAPapa John's
We even had the opportunity to work with the NFL for Super Bowl LIII
LIIINFL
And over the last two years we've worked with over  business

to divert more than two million pounds of edible food from landfills

into the hands of people that needed it most

Applause

Thank you

Applause

This has accounted for about  million meals

and allowed us to start to expand our efforts to other cities

like Washington DC Chicago Miami Philadelphia and more

That's just one approach that actually tackles the problem

Another was the launch of our popup grocery stores

We recover excess food from businesses

and set up free community grocery stores right in the middle of food deserts

We bring out a chef

and we do onsite tastetestings and allow families to leave with recipe cards

We give every family reusable grocery bags and allow them to simply shop

minus the price tag

We wanted to give people access to meals

and not just food

We wanted to change the way that we think and work to solve hunger in this country

get people to believe that we can solve hunger

not as a nonprofit

not as a food bank

but as a social enterprise

with the goal of reducing waste and ending hunger

But it hasn't been as easy as I thought

to change the narrative and the thought process

on how we think that hunger can be solved

In  France became the first country

to ban supermarkets from throwing away unused food

Instead they must donate it

and they're fined if they don't

Yes

Applause

In  Italy followed suit

becoming the second European nation

to pass an antifoodwaste ban

And they stated it so simply as it was passed through legislation

We have millions of pounds of good food going to waste

and we have poor people that are going hungry

That simple

Denmark now has a mandated food waste grocery store

Its name Wefood
Wefood
They recover excess food from local grocery stores

and sell it at up to a  percent off discount

They then use all the proceeds and donate it to emergency aid programs

and social need issues for the people in need

It has been hailed as the Goodwill of grocery

And last year the world got its first paywhatyoucan grocery store

when Feed it Forward opened in Toronto

Their shelves remain stocked by recovering excess food

from major supermarkets

and allowing families to simply pay what they can

at their grocery store

This is amazing

This innovation we need more of

Everyone can take on the roles of changing the attitudes

about how we solve hunger

When we think of how we've allowed innovation and technology

to change our lives

from how we communicate with each other

to how we view our entertainment

to how we even receive food

it's amazing that we haven't solved hunger yet

We literally have cars that can drive themselves

and millions of people that cannot feed themselves

With millions of dollars being donated to end food insecurity

we should've solved hunger years ago

And I asked myself 

Applause

I asked myself why can't we escape this vicious cycle

Why haven't we solved this problem

I remember meeting with investors and pitching the idea

trying to raise funds for my business

and one of them said to me in true seriousness

Hunger is already being solved

as if millions of people weren't going to go to bed hungry that very night

and as if there was nothing else to do

And the reality is

one would think that hunger is being solved

but the truth is it's being worked on

If we really want to solve hunger

then we have to change the way we've been doing it

The same actions will always garner the same results

There are hundreds of social entrepreneurs all over the world

They have a focus to solve really big problems like hunger

but they'll never get the same support

that we give national hungerfighting organizations and food banks

But if given the opportunity

they have the ability to foster insight

and perhaps be forwardthinking enough

to solve this problem

That's why I'm traveling the world

and I'm really talking about what hunger looks like in America

and explaining the difference between giving people access to food

and access to meals

I've been meeting with city council members

and city organizers across the US

and telling them that technology indeed does have the power

to connect businesses with surplus food

to people in need

and explaining to them what a meal can actually mean to a family

I've been meeting with school boards and school districts

to talk about how we feed hungry children

and health care organizations

sharing the message that food is health

and food is life

and that by solving hunger we can solve so many more problems

So if we want to know

that we don't live in a nation

where perfectly good food goes to waste

when our neighbors don't have food to eat

then we need to change the laws

We need to introduce new policies

and most importantly we need to change our minds and our actions

Food drives are fine

Food banks serve a huge purpose

And yes sometimes I like Ding Dongs too

But the reality is that food drives do not solve hunger

And if we are smart about connecting the dots

that are right in front of our noses

we can do far more than give a family

a box of superheroshaped vegetableenriched macaroni noodles

and a gallon of barbecue sauce

to feed themselves

Instead we can give them back their dignity

Perhaps we can increase school attendance in schools

We can improve the health outcomes for millions

And most importantly we can reduce food waste in our landfills

creating a better environment for all of us

The thing I love most is that we can feel good about it in the process

If we solve hunger

we have nothing to lose and everything to gain

So let's do it

Thank you

Applause

Thank you

Chris Anderson Nick Bostrom

So you have already given us so many crazy ideas out there

I think a couple of decades ago

you made the case that we might all be living in a simulation

or perhaps probably were

More recently

you've painted the most vivid examples of how artificial general intelligence

could go horribly wrong

And now this year

you're about to publish

a paper that presents something called the vulnerable world hypothesis

And our job this evening is to give the illustrated guide to that

So let's do that

What is that hypothesis

Nick Bostrom It's trying to think about

a sort of structural feature of the current human condition

You like the urn metaphor

so I'm going to use that to explain it

So picture a big urn filled with balls

representing ideas methods possible technologies

You can think of the history of human creativity

as the process of reaching into this urn and pulling out one ball after another

and the net effect so far has been hugely beneficial right

We've extracted a great many white balls

some various shades of gray mixed blessings

We haven't so far pulled out the black ball 

a technology that invariably destroys the civilization that discovers it

So the paper tries to think about what could such a black ball be

CA So you define that ball
CA
as one that would inevitably bring about civilizational destruction

NB Unless we exit what I call the semianarchic default condition

But sort of by default

CA So you make the case compelling
CA
by showing some sort of counterexamples

where you believe that so far we've actually got lucky

that we might have pulled out that death ball

without even knowing it

So there's this quote what's this quote

NB Well I guess it's just meant to illustrate
NB
the difficulty of foreseeing

what basic discoveries will lead to

We just don't have that capability

Because we have become quite good at pulling out balls

but we don't really have the ability to put the ball back into the urn right

We can invent but we can't uninvent

So our strategy such as it is

is to hope that there is no black ball in the urn

CA So once it's out it's out and you can't put it back in
CA
and you think we've been lucky

So talk through a couple of these examples

You talk about different types of vulnerability

NB So the easiest type to understand
NB
is a technology that just makes it very easy

to cause massive amounts of destruction

Synthetic biology might be a fecund source of that kind of black ball

but many other possible things we could 

think of geoengineering really great right

We could combat global warming

but you don't want it to get too easy either

you don't want any random person and his grandmother

to have the ability to radically alter the earth's climate

Or maybe lethal autonomous drones

massedproduced mosquitosized killer bot swarms

Nanotechnology artificial general intelligence

CA You argue in the paper
CA
that it's a matter of luck that when we discovered

that nuclear power could create a bomb

it might have been the case

that you could have created a bomb

with much easier resources accessible to anyone

NB Yeah so think back to the s
NB
where for the first time we make some breakthroughs in nuclear physics

some genius figures out that it's possible to create a nuclear chain reaction

and then realizes that this could lead to the bomb

And we do some more work

it turns out that what you require to make a nuclear bomb

is highly enriched uranium or plutonium

which are very difficult materials to get

You need ultracentrifuges

you need reactors like massive amounts of energy

But suppose it had turned out instead

there had been an easy way to unlock the energy of the atom

That maybe by baking sand in the microwave oven

or something like that

you could have created a nuclear detonation

So we know that that's physically impossible

But before you did the relevant physics

how could you have known how it would turn out

CA Although couldn't you argue
CA
that for life to evolve on Earth

that implied sort of stable environment

that if it was possible to create massive nuclear reactions relatively easy

the Earth would never have been stable

that we wouldn't be here at all

NB Yeah unless there were something that is easy to do on purpose
NB
but that wouldn't happen by random chance

So like things we can easily do

we can stack  blocks on top of one another

but in nature you're not going to find like a stack of  blocks

CA OK so this is probably the one
CA
that many of us worry about most

and yes synthetic biology is perhaps the quickest route

that we can foresee in our near future to get us here

NB Yeah and so think about what that would have meant
NB
if say anybody by working in their kitchen for an afternoon

could destroy a city

It's hard to see how modern civilization as we know it

could have survived that

Because in any population of a million people

there will always be some who would for whatever reason

choose to use that destructive power

So if that apocalyptic residual

would choose to destroy a city or worse

then cities would get destroyed

CA So here's another type of vulnerability
CA
Talk about this

NB Yeah so in addition to these kind of obvious types of black balls
NB
that would just make it possible to blow up a lot of things

other types would act by creating bad incentives

for humans to do things that are harmful

So the Typea we might call it that
a
is to think about some technology that incentivizes great powers

to use their massive amounts of force to create destruction

So nuclear weapons were actually very close to this right

What we did we spent over  trillion dollars

to build  nuclear warheads

and put them on hairtrigger alert

And there were several times during the Cold War

we almost blew each other up

It's not because a lot of people felt this would be a great idea

let's all spend  trillion dollars to blow ourselves up

but the incentives were such that we were finding ourselves 

this could have been worse

Imagine if there had been a safe first strike

Then it might have been very tricky

in a crisis situation

to refrain from launching all their nuclear missiles

If nothing else because you would fear that the other side might do it

CA Right mutual assured destruction
CA
kept the Cold War relatively stable

without that we might not be here now

NB It could have been more unstable than it was

And there could be other properties of technology

It could have been harder to have arms treaties

if instead of nuclear weapons

there had been some smaller thing or something less distinctive

CA And as well as bad incentives for powerful actors
CA
you also worry about bad incentives for all of us in Typeb here
b
NB Yeah so here we might take the case of global warming

There are a lot of little conveniences

that cause each one of us to do things

that individually have no significant effect right

But if billions of people do it

cumulatively it has a damaging effect

Now global warming could have been a lot worse than it is

So we have the climate sensitivity parameter right

It's a parameter that says how much warmer does it get

if you emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases

But suppose that it had been the case

that with the amount of greenhouse gases we emitted

instead of the temperature rising by say

between three and  degrees by 

suppose it had been  degrees or  degrees

Like then we might have been in a very bad situation

Or suppose that renewable energy had just been a lot harder to do

Or that there had been more fossil fuels in the ground

CA Couldn't you argue that if in that case of 
CA
if what we are doing today

had resulted in  degrees difference in the time period that we could see

actually humanity would have got off its ass and done something about it

We're stupid but we're not maybe that stupid

Or maybe we are

NB I wouldn't bet on it
NB
Laughter

You could imagine other features

So right now it's a little bit difficult to switch to renewables and stuff right

but it can be done

But it might just have been with slightly different physics

it could have been much more expensive to do these things

CA And what's your view Nick
CA
Do you think putting these possibilities together

that this earth humanity that we are

we count as a vulnerable world

That there is a death ball in our future

NB It's hard to say
NB
I mean I think there might well be various black balls in the urn

that's what it looks like

There might also be some golden balls

that would help us protect against black balls

And I don't know which order they will come out

CA I mean one possible philosophical critique of this idea
CA
is that it implies a view that the future is essentially settled

That there either is that ball there or it's not

And in a way

that's not a view of the future that I want to believe

I want to believe that the future is undetermined

that our decisions today will determine

what kind of balls we pull out of that urn

NB I mean if we just keep inventing

like eventually we will pull out all the balls

I mean I think there's a kind of weak form of technological determinism

that is quite plausible

like you're unlikely to encounter a society

that uses flint axes and jet planes

But you can almost think of a technology as a set of affordances

So technology is the thing that enables us to do various things

and achieve various effects in the world

How we'd then use that of course depends on human choice

But if we think about these three types of vulnerability

they make quite weak assumptions about how we would choose to use them

So a Type vulnerability again this massive destructive power

it's a fairly weak assumption

to think that in a population of millions of people

there would be some that would choose to use it destructively

CA For me the most single disturbing argument
CA
is that we actually might have some kind of view into the urn

that makes it actually very likely that we're doomed

Namely if you believe in accelerating power

that technology inherently accelerates

that we build the tools that make us more powerful

then at some point you get to a stage

where a single individual can take us all down

and then it looks like we're screwed

Isn't that argument quite alarming

NB Ah yeah
NB
Laughter

I think 

Yeah we get more and more power

and [it's] easier and easier to use those powers

but we can also invent technologies that kind of help us control

how people use those powers

CA So let's talk about that let's talk about the response
CA
Suppose that thinking about all the possibilities

that are out there now 

it's not just synbio it's things like cyberwarfare

artificial intelligence etc etc 
 
that there might be serious doom in our future

What are the possible responses

And you've talked about four possible responses as well

NB Restricting technological development doesn't seem promising

if we are talking about a general halt to technological progress

I think neither feasible

nor would it be desirable even if we could do it

I think there might be very limited areas

where maybe you would want slower technological progress

You don't I think want faster progress in bioweapons

or in say isotope separation

that would make it easier to create nukes

CA I mean I used to be fully on board with that
CA
But I would like to actually push back on that for a minute

Just because first of all

if you look at the history of the last couple of decades

you know it's always been push forward at full speed

it's OK that's our only choice

But if you look at globalization and the rapid acceleration of that

if you look at the strategy of move fast and break things

and what happened with that

and then you look at the potential for synthetic biology

I don't know that we should move forward rapidly

or without any kind of restriction

to a world where you could have a DNA printer in every home
DNA
and high school lab

There are some restrictions right

NB Possibly there is the first part the not feasible

If you think it would be desirable to stop it

there's the problem of feasibility

So it doesn't really help if one nation kind of 

CA No it doesn't help if one nation does
CA
but we've had treaties before

That's really how we survived the nuclear threat

was by going out there

and going through the painful process of negotiating

I just wonder whether the logic isn't that we as a matter of global priority

we shouldn't go out there and try

like now start negotiating really strict rules

on where synthetic bioresearch is done

that it's not something that you want to democratize no

NB I totally agree with that 

that it would be desirable for example

maybe to have DNA synthesis machines
DNA
not as a product where each lab has their own device

but maybe as a service

Maybe there could be four or five places in the world

where you send in your digital blueprint and the DNA comes back right
DNA
And then you would have the ability

if one day it really looked like it was necessary

we would have like a finite set of choke points

So I think you want to look for kind of special opportunities

where you could have tighter control

CA Your belief is fundamentally
CA
we are not going to be successful in just holding back

Someone somewhere  North Korea you know 

someone is going to go there and discover this knowledge

if it's there to be found

NB That looks plausible under current conditions

It's not just synthetic biology either

I mean any kind of profound new change in the world

could turn out to be a black ball

CA Let's look at another possible response
CA
NB This also I think has only limited potential
NB
So with the Type vulnerability again
Type
I mean if you could reduce the number of people who are incentivized

to destroy the world

if only they could get access and the means

that would be good

CA In this image that you asked us to do
CA
you're imagining these drones flying around the world

with facial recognition

When they spot someone showing signs of sociopathic behavior

they shower them with love they fix them

NB I think it's like a hybrid picture

Eliminate can either mean like incarcerate or kill

or it can mean persuade them to a better view of the world

But the point is that

suppose you were extremely successful in this

and you reduced the number of such individuals by half

And if you want to do it by persuasion

you are competing against all other powerful forces

that are trying to persuade people

parties religion education system

But suppose you could reduce it by half

I don't think the risk would be reduced by half

Maybe by five or  percent

CA You're not recommending that we gamble humanity's future on response two
CA
NB I think it's all good to try to deter and persuade people

but we shouldn't rely on that as our only safeguard

CA How about three
CA
NB I think there are two general methods

that we could use to achieve the ability to stabilize the world

against the whole spectrum of possible vulnerabilities

And we probably would need both

So one is an extremely effective ability

to do preventive policing

Such that you could intercept

If anybody started to do this dangerous thing

you could intercept them in real time and stop them

So this would require ubiquitous surveillance

everybody would be monitored all the time

CA This is Minority Report essentially a form of
CA
NB You would have maybe AI algorithms
NBAI
big freedom centers that were reviewing this etc etc

CA You know that mass surveillance is not a very popular term right now
CA
Laughter

NB Yeah so this little device there
NB
imagine that kind of necklace that you would have to wear at all times

with multidirectional cameras

But to make it go down better

just call it the freedom tag or something like that

Laughter

CA OK
CA
I mean this is the conversation friends

this is why this is such a mindblowing conversation

NB Actually there's a whole big conversation on this
NB
on its own obviously

There are huge problems and risks with that right

We may come back to that

So the other the final

the other general stabilization capability

is kind of plugging another governance gap

So the surveillance would be kind of governance gap at the microlevel

like preventing anybody from ever doing something highly illegal

Then there's a corresponding governance gap

at the macro level at the global level

You would need the ability reliably

to prevent the worst kinds of global coordination failures

to avoid wars between great powers

arms races

cataclysmic commons problems

in order to deal with the Typea vulnerabilities
a
CA Global governance is a term
CA
that's definitely way out of fashion right now

but could you make the case that throughout history

the history of humanity

is that at every stage of technological power increase

people have reorganized and sort of centralized the power

So for example when a roving band of criminals

could take over a society

the response was well you have a nationstate

and you centralize force a police force or an army

so No you can't do that

The logic perhaps of having a single person or a single group

able to take out humanity

means at some point we're going to have to go this route

at least in some form no

NB It's certainly true that the scale of political organization has increased

over the course of human history

It used to be huntergatherer band right

and then chiefdom citystates nations

now there are international organizations and so on and so forth

Again I just want to make sure

I get the chance to stress

that obviously there are huge downsides

and indeed massive risks

both to mass surveillance and to global governance

I'm just pointing out that if we are lucky

the world could be such that these would be the only ways

you could survive a black ball

CA The logic of this theory
CA
it seems to me

is that we've got to recognize we can't have it all

That the sort of

I would say naive dream that many of us had

that technology is always going to be a force for good

keep going don't stop go as fast as you can

and not pay attention to some of the consequences

that's actually just not an option

We can have that

If we have that

we're going to have to accept

some of these other very uncomfortable things with it

and kind of be in this arms race with ourselves

of you want the power you better limit it

you better figure out how to limit it

NB I think it is an option

a very tempting option it's in a sense the easiest option

and it might work

but it means we are fundamentally vulnerable to extracting a black ball

Now I think with a bit of coordination

like if you did solve this macrogovernance problem

and the microgovernance problem

then we could extract all the balls from the urn

and we'd benefit greatly

CA I mean if we're living in a simulation does it matter
CA
We just reboot

Laughter

NB Then  I 
NB 
Laughter

I didn't see that one coming

CA So what's your view
CA
Putting all the pieces together how likely is it that we're doomed

Laughter

I love how people laugh when you ask that question

NB On an individual level

we seem to kind of be doomed anyway just with the time line

we're rotting and aging and all kinds of things right

Laughter

It's actually a little bit tricky

If you want to set up so that you can attach a probability

first who are we

If you're very old probably you'll die of natural causes

if you're very young you might have a year 

the probability might depend on who you ask

Then the threshold like what counts as civilizational devastation

In the paper I don't require an existential catastrophe

in order for it to count

This is just a definitional matter

I say a billion dead

or a reduction of world GDP by  percent
GDP
but depending on what you say the threshold is

you get a different probability estimate

But I guess you could put me down as a frightened optimist

Laughter

CA You're a frightened optimist
CA
and I think you've just created a large number of other frightened 

people

Laughter

NB In the simulation

CA In a simulation
CA
Nick Bostrom your mind amazes me

thank you so much for scaring the living daylights out of us

Translator Ivana Korom Reviewer Krystian Aparta
Ivana Korom ReviewerKrystian aparta
I wanted to be a psychologist since I was a teenager

and I spent years pursuing that one goal

I opened my private practice as soon as I was licensed

It was a risky move not getting a day job at a hospital or a clinic

but within one year my practice was doing quite well

and I was making more money than I ever made before

Of course I was a fulltime student my entire life

Laughter

I could have worked at McDonald's

and made more money than I ever made before

That oneyear mark came on a Friday night in July

I walked home to my apartment

and got into the elevator with a neighbor who was a doctor in the ER

The elevator rose

then it shuddered and stalled between floors

And the man who dealt with emergencies for a living

began poking at the buttons and banging on the door saying

This is my nightmare this is my nightmare

And I was like And this is my nightmare

Laughter

I felt terrible afterwards though

Because I wasn't panicked

and I knew what to say to calm him down

I was just too depleted to do it

I had nothing left to give and that confused me

After all I was finally living my dream

so why wasn't I happy

Why did I feel so burned out

For a few terrible weeks

I questioned whether I'd made a mistake

What if I had chosen the wrong profession

What if I had spent my entire life pursuing the wrong career

But then I realized no I still loved psychology

The problem wasn't the work I did in my office

It was the hours I spent ruminating about work

when I was home

I closed the door to my office every night

but the door in my head remained wideopen

and the stress just flooded in

That's the interesting thing about work stress

We don't really experience much of it at work

We're too busy

We experience it outside of work

when we are commuting

when we're home

when we're trying to rejuvenate

It is important to recover in our spare time

to destress and do things we enjoy

and the biggest obstruction we face in that regard is ruminating

Because each time we do it

we're actually activating our stress response

Now to ruminate means to chew over

The word refers to how cows digest their food

For those of you unfamiliar with the joys of cow digestion

cows chew

then they swallow

then they regurgitate it back up and chew it again

Laughter

It's disgusting

Laughter

But it works for cows

Laughter

It does not work for humans

Because what we chew over are the upsetting things

the distressing things

and we do it in ways that are entirely unproductive

It's the hours we spend obsessing about tasks we didn't complete

or stewing about tensions with a colleague

or anxiously worrying about the future

or secondguessing decisions we've made

Now there's a lot of research on how we think about work

when we are not at work

and the findings are quite alarming

Ruminating about work

replaying the same thoughts and worries over and over again

significantly disrupts our ability to recover and recharge in the off hours

The more we ruminate about work when we're home

the more likely we are to experience sleep disturbances

to eat unhealthier foods

and to have worse moods

It may even increase our risk of cardiovascular disease

and of impairing our executive functioning

the very skill sets we need to do our jobs well

Not to mention the toll it takes on our relationships and family lives

because people around us can tell we're checked out and preoccupied

Now those same studies found

that while ruminating about work when we're home

damages our emotional wellbeing

thinking about work in creative or problemsolving ways does not

Because those kinds of thinking do not elicit emotional distress

and more importantly they're in our control

We can decide whether to respond to an email

or leave it till morning

or whether we want to brainstorm about work projects that excite us

But ruminations are involuntary

They're intrusive

They pop into our head when we don't want them to

They upset us when we don't want to be upset

They switch us on when we are trying to switch off

And they are very difficult to resist

because thinking of all our unfinished tasks feels urgent

Anxiously worrying about the future feels compelling

Ruminating always feels like we're doing something important

when in fact we're doing something harmful

And we all do it far more than we realize

Back when I was burned out

I decided to keep a journal for a week

and document exactly how much time I spent ruminating

And I was horrified by the results

It was over  minutes a night when I was trying to fall asleep

My entire commute to and from my office 

that was  minutes a day

Totally checked out for  minutes

during the dinner party at a colleague's house

Never got invited there again

Laughter

And  minutes during a friend's talent show

that coincidentally was  minutes long

Laughter

In total that week it was almost  hours

That's how much downtime I was losing

to something that actually increased my stress

Try keeping a journal for one week

See how much you do it

That's what made me realize that I still loved my work

But ruminating was destroying that love

and it was destroying my personal life too

So I read every study I could find

and I went to war against my ruminations

Now habit change is hard

It took real diligence to catch myself ruminating each time

and real consistency to make the new habits stick

But eventually they did

I won my war against ruminating

and I'm here to tell you how you can win yours

First you need clear guardrails

You have to define when you switch off every night

when you stop working

And you have to be strict about it

The rule I made to myself at the time was that I was done at pm

And I forced myself to stick to it

Now people say to me

Really You didn't return a single email after pm
 
You didn't even look at your phone

No not once

Because it was the 's we didn't have smartphones

Laughter

I got my first smartphone in 

You know the iPhone had just come out
iPhone
and I wanted a phone that was cool and hip

I got a BlackBerry

Laughter

I was excited though

you know my first thought was I get my emails wherever I am

And  hours later

I was like I get my emails wherever I am

Laughter

I mean battling ruminations was hard enough

when they just invaded our thoughts

But now they have this Trojan horse

our phones to hide within

And each time we just look at our phone after hours

we can be reminded of work

and ruminative thoughts can slip out

and slaughter our evening or weekend

So when you switch off

switch off your email notifications

And if you have to check them decide on when to do it

so it doesn't interfere with your plans

and do it only then

Cell phones aren't the only way technology is empowering rumination

because we have an even bigger fight coming

Telecommuting has increased  percent over the past decade

And it's expected to increase even more dramatically going forward

More and more of us are losing our physical boundary

between work and home

And that means that reminders of work

will be able to trigger ruminations from anywhere in our home

When we lack a physical boundary between work and home

we have to create a psychological one

We have to trick our mind

into defining work and nonwork times and spaces

So here's how you do that

First create a defined work zone in your home

even if it's tiny

and try to work only there

Try not to work on the living room couch

or on the bed

because really those areas should be associated

with living and  bedding

Laughter

Next when you're working from home

wear clothes you only wear when you're working

And then at the end of the day

change clothes

and use music and lighting to shift the atmosphere

from work to home

Make it a ritual

Now some of you might think that's silly

That changing clothes and lighting

will convince my mind I'm no longer at work

Trust me your mind will fall for it

Because we are really smart our mind is really stupid

Laughter

It falls for random associations all the time right

I mean that's why Pavlov's dog began drooling at the sound of a bell

And why TED speakers begin sweating at the sight of a red circle
TED
Laughter

Now those things will help

but ruminations will still invade

And when they do you have to convert them

into productive forms of thinking like problemsolving

My patient Sally is a good example

Sally was given the promotion of a lifetime

but it came with a price

She was no longer able to pick up her daughter

from school every day

and that broke her heart

So she came up with a plan

Every Tuesday and Thursday Sally left work early

picked up her daughter from school

played with her fed her bathed her and put her to bed

And then she went back to the office

and worked past midnight to catch up

Only Sally's rumination journal indicated

she spent almost every minute of her quality time with her daughter

ruminating about how much work she had to do

Ruminations often deny us our most precious moments

Sally's rumination I have so much work to do

is a very common one

And like all of them

it's useless and it's harmful

because we'd never think it when we're at work getting stuff done

We think it when we're outside of work

when we're trying to relax or do things that we find meaningful

like playing with our children

or having a date night with our partner

To convert a ruminative thought into a productive one

you have to pose it as a problem to be solved

The problemsolving version of I have so much work to do

is a scheduling question

Like Where in my schedule can I fit the tasks that are troubling me

Or What can I move in my schedule to make room for this more urgent thing

Or even When do I have  minutes to go over my schedule

All those are problems that can be solved

I have so much work to do is not

Battling rumination is hard

but if you stick to your guardrails

if you ritualize the transition from work to home

and if you train yourself to convert ruminations

into productive forms of thinking

you will succeed

Banishing ruminations truly enhanced my personal life

but what it enhanced even more

was the joy and satisfaction I get from my work

Ground zero for creating a healthy worklife balance

is not in the real world

It's in our head

It's with ruminating

If you want to reduce your stress and improve your quality of life

you don't necessarily have to change your hours or your job

You just have to change how you think

Thank you

Applause

chime dinging

majestic orchestral music

It is such a sort of instrumental part

of our cooking vocabulary in terms of the utensils

I was like Huh that's interesting

there're people out there who live without chopsticks

upbeat music

Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks

used to eat things with one hand

Holding chopsticks is a little bit like holding a pencil

except that you have two of them

and you kinda move them together in a pincher movement

Most of them are made out of wood

they are also made out of plastic bamboo jade

gold silver and even ivory

though I think that's not so cool these days any more

Chopsticks are really well designed

for eating small bits of food

They're good for picking up noodles

If you're really skilled you can eat rice

you can pick up dumplings little pieces of meat

There're definitely some nonos with chopsticks

You should not use the chopsticks like drumsticks

which I know is very very tempting

You definitely don't wanna stick chopsticks

into a bowl of rice faceup

and the reason for that

is it actually looks like a bowl of incense

so it sort of echos death

Chopsticks are used in a huge portion of the world

across much of Asia

About  billion people are covered

in the chopsticks sphere

Different cultures have slightly different variations

of chopsticks

Chinese chopsticks will tend to be long and round

Korean chopsticks which are flatter

and often made of metal

and Japanese chopsticks tend to be round

and very very pointy

While chopsticks are actually really commonplace

in American society today

there was definitely a time in the late s

where this idea that Asian men

because they ate rice with sticks

were of a different quality than American men

who ate proper meat with knife and fork

But when China and the United States

began their diplomatic engagement in the s

Richard Nixon Henry Kissinger

had to practice eating with chopsticks

What's been really interesting to see

is that as Asian cuisine has moved

from the east into the west

chopsticks have become part of the experience

There's evidence of chopsticks

as long ago as the Shang dynasty

which was about  years ago

and they loved tripods during the Shang dynasty

So when you cook with these big tripods

chopsticks were actually really useful

because it was a way for you to stir and to reach

without getting burned as the water was boiling

in these really big pots

Chinese culture has knives and has forks

that uses them in many cases for cooking

but in terms of what moved into the dining room

it was the chopsticks

One of the things about Asian cooking

is that it often comes in very small pieces

and I think part of that has to do with the fact

that it's actually a lot more energy efficient

to cook little pieces quickly

but also then you don't have to cut them

So you kind of have the circular influence

where the type of food that is cooked

allows people to use chopsticks

and then the fact that you have chopsticks

sort of influences the kind of food that you can cook

At the same time

chopsticks reflect the communal nature of eating food

You will have these dishes that you put in the middle

it's very family style

You kinda go in with your chopsticks

and then you put it on your rice

and then you eat individually

There's actually a famous sort of legend

where everyone has these really really

really long chopsticks

like way too long for them to feed themselves

And so in Hell everyone starves

because they can't pick up food

and put it in their mouths

but in Heaven people take the same chopsticks

and then feed each other

exciting musical chord

When we're young we're innocently brave

and we fearlessly dream about what our lives might be like

Maybe you wanted to be an astronaut or a rocket scientist

Maybe you dreamed of traveling to every continent

Since I was very young

I dreamed of working for the United Nations

in some of the most difficult countries in the world

And thanks to a lot of courage

that dream came true

But here's the thing about courage

it doesn't just appear whenever we need it

It's the result of tough reflection and real work

involving the balance between fear and bravery

Without fear we'll do foolish things

And without courage we'll never step into the unknown

The balance of the two is where the magic lies

and it's a balance we all deal with every day

First a word about my fancy wheels

I haven't always used a wheelchair

I grew up like many of you

running jumping and dancing

I love to dance

However in my midtwenties

I began to experience a series of inexplicable falls

And a few years later

I was diagnosed with a recessive genetic condition

called hereditary inclusion body myopathy

or HIBM
HIBM
It's a progressive muscle wasting disease

that affects all of my muscles from head to toe

HIBM is very rare
HIBM
In the United States there are less than  people diagnosed

To date there is no proved treatment or cure

and within  to  years of its onset

HIBM typically leads to quadriplegia
HIBM
which is why I now use a wheelchair

When I was first diagnosed everything changed

It was frightening news

because I had no experience with chronic illness or disabilities

And I had no idea how the disease might progress

But what was most disheartening

was to listen to other people advise me

to limit my ambitions and dreams

and to change my expectations of what to expect from life

You should quit your international career

No one will marry you this way

You would be selfish to have children

The fact that someone who wasn't me

was putting limitations on my dreams and ambitions

was preposterous

And unacceptable

So I ignored them

Cheers and applause

I did get married

And I decided for myself not to have children

And I continued my career with the United Nations

after my diagnosis

going to work for two years in Angola

a country recovering from  years of brutal civil war

However it would be another five years

until I officially declared my diagnosis to my employer

Because I was afraid

that they would question my capacity to manage and I'd lose my job

I was working in countries where polio had been common

so when I overheard someone say

that they thought I might have survived polio

I thought my secret was safe

No one asked why I was limping

So I didn't say anything

It took me over a decade

to internalize the severity of HIBM
HIBM
even as basic tasks and functions became increasingly difficult

Yet I continued to pursue my dream of working all over the world

and was even appointed as a disability focal point

for UNICEF in Haiti

where I served for two years after the devastating  earthquake

And then my work brought me to the United States

And even as the disease progressed significantly

and I needed leg braces and a walker to get around

I still longed for adventure

And this time

I started dreaming of a grand outdoor adventure

And what's more grand than the Grand Canyon

Did you know that for every five million people who visit the Rim

only one percent go down to the canyon's base

I wanted to be a part of that one percent

The only thing is 

Applause

The only thing is that the Grand Canyon isn't exactly accessible

I was going to need some assistance

to get down the foot descent of vertical loose terrain

Now when I face obstacles

fear doesn't necessarily immediately set in

because I assume that one way or another

I'll figure it out

And in this case my thought was

well if I can't walk down

I could learn to ride a horse

So that's what I did

And with that fateful decision

began a fouryear commitment

tossing back and forth between fear and courage

to undertake a day expedition

Four days on horseback to cross Grand Canyon rim to rim

and eight days rafting  miles of the Colorado River

all with a film crew in tow

Spoiler alert  we made it

But not without showing me how my deepest fear

can somehow manifest a mirror response of equal courage

On April  

sitting eight feet above the ground

riding a mustang horse named Sheriff

my first impression of Grand Canyon

was one of shock and terror

Who knew I had a fear of heights

Laughter

But there was no giving up now

I mustered up every ounce of courage inside me

to not let my fear get the best of me

Embarking on the South Rim

all I could do to keep myself composed

was to breathe deeply stare up into the clouds

and focus on my team's voices

But then in the first hour disaster struck

Unable to hold myself upright in the saddle

going down an oversized step

I flung forward and smacked my face on the back of the horse's head

There was panic

my head hurt fiercely

but the path was too narrow for us to dismount

Only at the halfway point at  feet

at least another two hours down

could we stop and remove my helmet

and see the eggsized bump protruding from my forehead

For all of that planning and gear

how is it that we didn't even have an ice pack

Laughter

Luckily for all of us the swelling came outwards

and would drain into my face as two fantastic black eyes

which is an amazing way to look in a documentary film

Laughter

Applause and cheers

This was not an easy peaceful journey

and yet that was exactly the point

Even though I was afraid to get back into the saddle

I got back in

The descent alone to the canyon floor

took a total of  hours

and that was just day one of four riding

Next came the mighty rapids

The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon

has some of the highest white water in the country

And just to be prepared in case we should capsize

we'd practice having me swim through a smaller rapid

And it's safe to say it wasn't glamorous

Laughter

I took my breath in the wrong part of the wave

choked on river water

and was unable to steer myself

Yes it was scary

but it was also fantastic

Waterfalls slick canyons

and a couple billion years of bedrock

that seemed to change color throughout the day

The Grand Canyon is true wilderness

and worthy of all of its accolades

Applause

The expedition

all that planning and the trip itself

showed me a level of fear I had never experienced before

But more importantly

it showed me how boldly courageous I can be

My Grand Canyon journey was not easy

This was not a vision of an Amazonian woman

effortlessly making her way through epic scenery

This was me crying

exhausted and beat up with two black eyes

It was scary

it was stressful

it was exhilarating

Now that the trip is over

it's easy to be blas about what we achieved

I know I want to raft the river again

This time all  miles of it

Applause

But I also know that I would never do the horsebackriding part again

Laughter

It's just too dangerous

And that's my real point

I'm not just here to show you my film footage

I'm here to remind us all

that life is really just a lesson

in finding the balance between fear and courage

And understanding what is and what isn't a good idea

Laughter

Life is already scary

so for our dreams to come true we need to be brave

In facing my fears

and finding the courage to push through them

I swear my life has been extraordinary

So live big

and try to let your courage outweigh your fear

You never know where it might take you

Thank you

Applause and cheers

I'm going to tell you a story

I'm going to tell you a story

about how the deadliest consumer product imaginable

came to be

It's the cigarette

The cigarette is the only consumer product

that when used as intended

will kill half of all longterm users prematurely later in life

But this is also a story

about the work that we're doing at the Food and Drug Administration

and specifically the work that we're doing

to create the cigarette of the future

that is no longer capable of creating or sustaining addiction

A lot of people think that the tobacco problem or the smoking problem

has been solved in the United States

because of the great progress that's been made

over the last   years

when it comes to both consumption and prevalence

And it's true

smoking rates are at historic lows

It's true for both adults and for kids

And it's true that those who continue to smoke

are smoking far fewer cigarettes per day

than at any time in history

But what if I told you that tobacco use

primarily because of firsthand and secondhand exposure

to the smoke in cigarettes

remains the leading cause of completely preventable disease and death

in this country

Well that's true

And what if I told you that it's actually killing more people

than we thought to be the case ever before

That's true too

Smoking kills more people each year than alcohol AIDS car accidents

illegal drugs murders and suicides combined

Year in and year out

In 

Dr Adams's predecessor released

the th anniversary Surgeon General's report

on smoking and health

And that report upped the annual death toll from smoking

because the list of smokingrelated illnesses

got bigger

And so it is now conservatively estimated

that smoking kills  Americans every year

These are completely preventable deaths

How do we wrap our heads around a statistic like this

So much of what we've heard at this conference

is about individual experiences and personal experiences

How do we deal with this at a population level

when there are  moms

dads sisters brothers aunts and uncles

dying unnecessary deaths every year from tobacco

And then what happens when you think about this trajectory

for the future

And just do the simple math

from the time of the th anniversary Surgeon General's report five years ago

when this horrible statistic was raised

just through midcentury 

that's more than  million avoidable deaths in the United States

from tobacco use

primarily because of cigarettes

The Surgeon General concluded

that  million children alive in the United States in 

will die prematurely later in life because of cigarettes

Five point six million children

So this is an enormous public health problem for all of us

but especially for us as regulators

at the Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Tobacco Products

What can we do about it

What can we do to reverse this trajectory of disease and death

Well we have an interesting guide to help unravel issues

like How did the cigarette as we know it come to be

What is the true nature of the tobacco and cigarette business

How did the industry behave

in the historically unregulated marketplace

And our guide

is previously secret internal documents from the tobacco industry

Come with me

in a tobacco industry document time machine

Nineteen sixtythree

was  years before the Surgeon General was finally able to conclude

that the nicotine and cigarettes was addictive

That did not happen until the Surgeon General's report in 

Nineteen sixtythree

was one year before the firstever Surgeon General's report in 

I remember 

I don't remember the Surgeon General's report

but I remember 

I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn New York

This was at a time

when almost one in two adults in the United States smoked

Both of my parents were heavy smokers at the time

Tobacco use was so incredibly normalized

that  and this wasn't North Carolina Virginia or Kentucky

this was Brooklyn 

we made ashtrays for our parents in arts and crafts class

Laughter

The ashtrays I made were pretty awful but they were ashtrays

Laughter

So normalized that I remember seeing a bowl of loose cigarettes in the foyer

of our house and other houses

as a welcoming gesture when friends came over for a visit

OK we're back in 

The top lawyer for Brown and Williamson

which was then the thirdlargest cigarette company in the United States

wrote the following

Nicotine is addictive

We are then in the business of selling nicotine  an addictive drug

It's a remarkable statement

as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does say

He didn't say they were in the cigarette business

He didn't say they were in the tobacco business

He said they were in the business of selling nicotine

Philip Morris in 
Philip Morris
The cigarette isn't a product

it's a package

The product is nicotine

The pack is a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine

The cigarette a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine

We'll come back to this dose unit notion later

And RJ Reynolds in 
RJReynolds
In a sense the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized

highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry

Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine

a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects

At the time and for many decades publicly

the industry completely denied addiction

and completely denied causality

But they knew the true nature of their business

And from time to time

there have been health scares made public about cigarettes

going back many decades

How did the industry respond

And how did they respond

in this historically unregulated marketplace

Going back to the s

it was with advertising that heavily featured imagery of doctors

and other health care professionals

sending messages of reassurance

This is an ad for Lucky Strikes

the popular cigarette of the time in the 's

[ physicians say Luckies are less irritating
[
Your throat protection against irritation against cough]
]
Laughter

We laugh

but this was the kind of advertising

that was there to send a health message of reassurance

Fastforward to s 's and 's

And here again in the absence of regulation

what we're going to see is modifications to the product

and product design

to respond to the health concerns of the day

This is the Kent Micronite filter
Kent Micronite
And here the innovation if you will was the filtered cigarette

[Full smoking pleasure 

plus proof of the greatest health protection ever]
]
What the smoker of this product didn't know

what their doctor didn't know

what the government didn't know

is that this was a filter that was lined with asbestos 

Gasps

so that when smokers were smoking this filtered cigarette

and still inhaling the chemicals and smoke

that we know are associated with cancer and lung disease

and heart disease

they were also sucking down asbestos fibers

Gasps

In the s and the s

the socalled innovation was the light cigarette

This is a typical brand of the day called True

And this is after the Surgeon General's reports have started coming out

And you see the look of concern on her face

[Considering all I'd heard
[
I decided to either quit or smoke True

I smoke True]
]
Laughter

[The low tar low nicotine cigarette]
[]
And then it says Think about it

And then even below that in the small print

are tar numbers and nicotine numbers

What was a light cigarette

How did it work

This is an illustration of the product modification

known as filter ventilation

That's not a real filter blown up

That's just a picture

so that you could see the rows of laserperforated ventilation holes

that were put on the filter

When you look at a real cigarette

it's harder to see

Every patent for this product shows

that the ventilation holes should be  millimeters

from the lip end of the filter

How did it work

The cigarette got stuck into a machine

The machine started puffing away on the cigarette

and recording tar and nicotine levels

As the machine smoked

outside air came through those ventilation holes

and diluted the amount of smoke that was coming through the cigarette

So as the machine smoked

there really was less tar and nicotine being delivered

compared to a regular cigarette

What the tobacco industry knew

was that human beings don't smoke like machines

How do human beings smoke this

Where do the fingers go

Murmurs
murmurs
Where do the lips go

I told you that the patent said

that the holes are  millimeters from the lip end

The smoker didn't even know they were there

but between fingers and lips the holes get blocked

And when the holes get blocked it's no longer a light cigarette

Turns out that there's actually

basically as much nicotine inside a light cigarette

as a regular cigarette

The difference was what's on the outside

But once you block what's on the outside

it's a regular cigarette

Congress put FDA in the business of regulating tobacco products
FDA
 years ago this June

So you heard the statistics at the beginning

about the extraordinary contribution to disease and death that cigarettes make

We've also been paying a lot of attention

to how the cigarette works as a drugdelivery device

and the remarkable efficiency with which it delivers nicotine

So let's take a look

When the smoker puffs on the cigarette

the nicotine from that puff gets up into the brain

in less than  seconds

Less than  seconds

Up in the brain

there are these things called nicotinic receptors

They're there 

waiting

They're waiting for in the words of that Philip Morris document

the next dose unit of nicotine

The smoker that you see outside

huddled with other smokers

in the cold

in the wind

in the rain

is experiencing craving

and may be experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal

Those symptoms of withdrawal are a chemical message

that these receptors are sending to the body

saying Feed me

And a product that can deliver the drug in less than  seconds

turns out to be an incredibly efficient and incredibly addictive product

We've spoken to so many addiction treatment experts

over the years

And the story I hear is the same over and over again

Long after I was able to get somebody off of heroin

or cocaine or crack cocaine

I can't get them to quit cigarettes

A large part of the explanation is the second thing

FDA has it within its regulatory reach
FDA
to use the tools of product regulation

to render cigarettes as we know them minimally or nonaddictive

We're working on this

And this could have a profound impact at a population level

from this one policy

We did dynamic populationlevel modeling a year ago

and we published the results in The New England Journal

And because of the generational effect of this policy

which I'll explain in a minute

here's what we project out through the end of the century

more than  million people

who would otherwise have gone on to become regular smokers won't

because the cigarette that they'll be experimenting with

can't create or sustain addiction

This would drive the adult smoking rate down to less than one and a half percent

And these two things combined

would result in the saving of more than eight million cigaretterelated deaths

that would otherwise have occurred

from the generational impact of this

Now why am I saying generational

It's about kids

Ninety percent of adult smokers started smoking when they were kids

Half of them became regular smokers

before they were legally old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes

Half of them became regular smokers before they were  years old

Experimentation

Regular smoking

Addiction

Decades of smoking

And then the illness

and that's why we're talking about a product

that will kill half of all longterm users prematurely later in life

The generational impact of this nicotinereduction policy

is profound

Those old industry documents had a word for young people

They were described as the replacement smokers

The replacement smokers for addicted adult smokers

who died or quit

Future generations of kids especially teens

are going to engage in risky behavior

We can't stop that

But what if the only cigarette that they could get their hands on

could no longer create or sustain addiction

That's the public health return on investment

at a population level over time

Haven't said anything about ecigarettes

But I have to say something about ecigarettes

Laughter

We are dealing with an epidemic of kids' use of ecigarettes

And what troubles us the most

in combination with the rising numbers when it comes to prevalence

is frequency

Not only are more kids using ecigarettes

but more kids are using ecigarettes  or more days in the past  days

than at any time since ecigarettes came onto the market

And at FDA we're doing everything that we can
FDA
using program and policy

first to get the word out to kids

that this is not a harmless product

and to make sure that kids aren't initiating and experimenting

on any tobacco product

whether combustion is present or not

But think about ecigarettes in a properly regulated marketplace

as something that could be of benefit

to addicted adult cigarette smokers

who are trying to transition away from cigarettes

So I'll leave you with this vision

imagine a world

where the only cigarette that future generations of kids

could experiment with

could no longer create or sustain addiction

because of a single policy

Imagine a world

where healthconcerned cigarette smokers

especially if a policy goes into effect

that takes the nicotine levels down to minimally or nonaddictive levels

could transition to alternative and less harmful forms

of nicotine delivery

starting with FDAapproved nicotine medications
FDA
like the gum patch and lozenge

And finally

imagine a world and a properly regulated marketplace

whether it's ecigarettes or whatever the technology of the day

it's not the product developers and the marketers

who decide which products come to market

and what claims get made for them

it's review scientists at FDA
FDA
who look at applications

and decide using the standard that Congress has entrusted us

to implement and enforce

whether a particular product should come to market

because the marketing of that product and the words of our law

would be appropriate for the protection of the public health

These are the kinds of powerful regulatory tools

that are within our reach

to deal with what remains

the leading cause of completely preventable disease and death

in the country

If we get this right

that trajectory those  million kids

is breakable

Thank you

Applause

OK I have a question for all of us

You ready

Is all winning success

Murmurs
murmurs
Oh

Laughter

Whoa OK
 
I am the recently retired head coach

of the UCLA Women's Gymnastics Team

a position that I held for  years

Applause

Thank you

And during my tenure

I experienced a lot of winning

I led our team to seven National Championships

I was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame

and I was even voted the Coach of the Century

by the Pac Conference
Pac
Applause

Winning is really really

like really really fun

Laughter

But I am here to share my insight

winning does not always equal success

All across America and around the world

we have a crisis

in the winatallcost cultures

that we have created

In our schools

in our businesses in politics

winning at all cost has become acceptable

As a society

we honor the people at the top of the pyramid

We effusively applaud those people who win championships and elections and awards

But sadly quite often

those same people are leaving their institutions

as damaged human beings

Sadly with straight A's
A
kids are leaving school damaged

With awards and medals

athletes often leave their teams damaged

emotionally mentally not just physically

And with huge profits employees often leave their companies damaged

We have become so hyperfocused on that end result

and when the end result is a win

the human component of how we got there

often gets swept under the proverbial rug

and so does the damage

So I'm calling for a timeout

Timeout

We need to redefine success

Real success is developing champions in life for our world

win or lose

Applause

Real success is developing champions in life

not for your team

not for your business

and I'm sad to tell you not even for your Christmas card bragging rights

Sorry

So how do we do this

First of all you may be able to dictate your way to a win

but you can't dictate your way to success

Let me take you back to  when I was first appointed the head coach

of the UCLA Women's Gymnastics Team

And I would like to share with you that I've never done gymnastics

I grew up in the world of ballet

I have never done a cartwheel

and I couldn't teach you how to do a proper cartwheel

Laughter

It's sadly true

And I knew nothing about how to develop a team culture

The best I could do was mimic other coaches who had won

And so I became toughtalking

toughminded relentless

unsympathetic

bullish unempathetic

and oftentimes downright mean

I acted like a head coach

whose only thought was to figure out how to win

My first few seasons as a head coach

were abysmal

and after putting up with my brash coaching style for a few years

our team asked me for a team meeting

Well I love team meetings

so I said Yay Let's have a team meeting
 
And for two solid hours

they gave me examples of how my arrogance was hurtful and demeaning

Yeah not yay

They explained to me

that they wanted to be supported

not belittled

They wanted to be coached up not torn down

They wanted to be motivated

not pressured or bullied

That was my timeout

and I chose to change

Being a dogmatic dictator

may produce compliant good little soldiers

but it doesn't develop champions in life

It is so much easier in any walk of life

to dictate and give orders

than to actually figure out how to motivate someone

to want to be better

And the reason is  we all know this 

motivation takes a really long time

to take root

But when it does

it is characterbuilding

and lifealtering

I realized that I needed to fortify our studentathletes

as whole human beings

not just athletes who won

So success for me shifted

from only focusing on winning

to developing my coaching philosophy

which is developing champions in life through sport

And I knew if I did this well enough

that champion mentality would translate to the competition floor

And it did

The key ingredient was to develop trust

through patience

respectful honesty

and accountability 

all of the ingredients that go into tough love

Speaking of tough love

Katelyn Ohashi is a perfect example of this
Katelyn Ohashi
You may have all seen her floor routine

It has had over  million views

And the consensus is her performance is pure joy

However when Katelyn came to UCLA she was broken in body mind and spirit

She had grown up in a stereotypical very highlevel athletic world

and she was damaged

So when Katelyn came to UCLA her freshman year

she found her inner rebel quite well

to the point where she was no longer able to do gymnastics

at the level at which she was recruited

And I will never forget

a team meeting we had halfway through her freshman season

We were in there with the team the coaching staff the support staff

sports psychologist

and Katelyn very clearly and unapologetically said

I just don't want to be great again

I felt like I got sucker punched

My first thought was

Then why the heck am I going to honor your scholarship

It was a really snarky thought and thankfully I didn't say it out loud

because then I had clarity

Katelyn didn't hate gymnastics

Katelyn hated everything associated with being great

Katelyn didn't want to be a winner

because winning at all cost had cost her her joy

My job was to figure out how to motivate her

to want to be great again

by helping her redefine success

My enthusiasm for that challenge turned into determination

when one day Katelyn looked me in the eye and said

Ms Val I just want you to know

everything you tell me to do I do the exact opposite

Laughter

Yeah it was like yeah Katelyn challenge accepted OK
 
Laughter

And further proof that dictating was not going to win

So I embarked on the painfully slow process

of building trust

and proving to her that first and foremost

I cared about her as a whole human being

Part of my strategy was to only talk to Katelyn about gymnastics in the gym

Outside of the gym we talked about everything else

school boys families friends hobbies

I encouraged her to find things outside of her sport that brought her joy

And it was so cool

to see the process of Katelyn Ohashi literally blossom before our eyes

And through that process

she rediscovered her selflove

and selfworth

And slowly she was able to bring that joy

back to her gymnastics

She went on to earn the NCAA title on floor

and she helped our team win our seventh NCAA championship in 
NCAA
So 

Thank you

Applause

So let's think about the Katelyn Ohashis in your life

Let's think about those people under your care and your guidance

What are you telling your kids on the car ride home

That car ride home

has much more impact than you know

Are you focusing on the end result

or are you excited to use that time

to help your child develop into a champion

It's very simple

you will know you're focusing on the end result

if you ask questions about the end result

Did you win

How many points did you score

Did you get an A
A
If you truly are motivated about helping your child develop into a champion

you will ask questions about the experience

and the process

like What did you learn today

Did you help a teammate

And my favorite question

Did you figure out how to have fun at working really really hard

And then the key is to be very still

and listen to their response

I believe that one of the greatest gifts we can give another human being

is to silence our minds

from the need to be right

or the need to formulate the appropriate response

and truly listen

when someone else is talking

And in silencing our minds

we actually hear our own fears and inadequacies

which can help us formulate our response

with more clarity and empathy

Kyla Ross another one of our gymnasts

is one of the greatest gymnasts in the history of the sport

She's the only athlete to have earned the trifecta

she's a national champion

a world champion

and an Olympic champion

She's also not one for small talk

so I was a bit surprised one day when she came to my office

sat on the couch

and just started talking 

first about her major

then about graduate school

and then about everything else that seemed to pop into her mind

My inner voice whispered to me

that something was on her mind

and if I was still

and gave her enough time

it would come out

And it did

It was the first time that Kyla had shared with anyone

that she had been sexually abused by Larry Nassar

the former USA Gymnastics team doctor

who was later convicted of being a serial child molester

Kyla came forward

and joined the army

of Nassar survivors

who shared their stories

and used their voices

to invoke positive change for our world

I felt it was extremely important at that time

to provide a safe space for Kyla and our team

And so I chose to talk about this in a few team meetings

Later that year we won the national championship

and after we did Kyla came up to me and shared with me the fact

that she felt one reason that we'd won

was because we had addressed the elephant in the room

the tragedy that had not only rocked the world

but that had liberated the truths and the memories in herself

and in so many of her friends

and her peers

As Kyla said

Ms Val I literally felt myself walk taller as the season went on

and when I walked onto that championship floor I felt invincible

Simply 

Applause

Simply because she had been heard

As parents as coaches

as leaders

we can no longer lead from a place

where winning is our only metric of success

where our ego sits center stage

because it has been proven

that that process produces broken human beings

And I emphatically know

that it is absolutely possible

to produce and train champions in life

in every single walk of life

without compromising the human spirit

Applause

It starts with defining success

for yourself and those under your care

and then consistently

selfexamining whether your actions are in alignment with your goals

We are all coaches in some capacity

We all have a collective responsibility

to develop champions in life for our world

That is what real success looks like

and in the world of athletics

that is what we call a winwin

Thank you

My first job out of college was as an academic researcher

at one of the largest juvenile detention centers in the country

And every day I would drive to this building

on the West Side of Chicago

go through the security checkpoint

and walk down these brown brick hallways as I made my way down to the basement

to observe the intake process

The kids coming in were about  to  years old

usually always black and brown

most likely from the same impoverished South and West Sides of Chicago

They should've been in fifth to tenth grade

but instead they were here for weeks on end

awaiting trial for various crimes

Some of them came back to the facility  times before their th birthday

And as I sat there on the other side of the glass from them

idealistic with a college degree

I wondered to myself

Why didn't schools do something more to prevent this from happening

It's been about  years since then

and I still think about how some kids get tracked towards college

and others towards detention

but I no longer think about schools' abilities to solve these things

You see I've learned that so much of this problem is systemic

that often our school system perpetuates the social divide

It makes worse what it's supposed to fix

That's as crazy or controversial

as saying that our health care system isn't preventative

but somehow profits off of keeping us sick 

oops

Laughter

I truly do believe though that kids can achieve great things

despite the odds against them

and in fact my own research shows that

But if we're serious about helping more kids from across the board

to achieve and make it in this world

we're going to have to realize that our gaps in student outcomes

are not so much about achievement as much as they are about opportunity

A  EdBuild report showed
EdBuild
that majoritywhite districts receive about  billion dollars more

in annual funding than nonwhite districts

even though they serve about the same number of students

Lower resource schools are dealing with lower quality equipment

obsolete technology

and paying teachers way less

Here in New York

those are also the schools most likely to serve

the one in  elementary school students

who will most likely have to sleep in a homeless shelter tonight

The student parent and teacher are dealing with a lot

Sometimes places are misplacing the blame back on them

In Atlanta we saw that teachers felt desperate enough

to have to help their students cheat on standardized tests

that would impact their funding

Eight of them went to jail for that in 

with some sentences as high as  years

which is more than what many states give for seconddegree murder

The thing is though in places like Tulsa

teachers' pay has been so bad

that these people have had to go to food pantries

or soup kitchens just to feed themselves

The same system will criminalize a parent who will use a relative's address

to send their child to a better school

but for who knows how long authorities have turned a blind eye

to those who can bribe their way

onto the most elite and beautiful college campuses

And a lot of this feels pretty heavy to be saying 

and maybe to be hearing 

and since there's nothing quite like economics talk to lighten the mood 

that's right right

Let me tell you about some of the costs

when we fail to tap into our students' potential

A McKinsey study showed that if in 

we could've closed our longstanding student achievement gaps

between students of different ethnic backgrounds

or students of different income levels

by  our GDP 
GDP
our untapped economic gains 

could have gone up by more than  billion dollars

Those same gaps in 

between our students here in the US and those across the world

may have deprived our economy

of up to  trillion dollars of economic output

But beyond economics numbers and figures

I think there's a simpler reason that this matters

a simpler reason for fixing our system

It's that in a true democracy

like the one we pride ourselves on having 

and sometimes rightfully so 

a child's future should not be predetermined

by the circumstances of their birth

A public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top

Some of us can sometimes think

that these things aren't that close to home

but they are if we broaden our view

because a leaky faucet in our kitchen

broken radiator in our hallway

those parts of the house that we always say we're going to get to next week

they're devaluing our whole property

Instead of constantly looking away to solutions like privatization

or the charter school movement to solve our problems

why don't we take a deeper look at public education

try to take more pride in it

and maybe use it to solve some of our social problems

Why don't we try to reclaim the promise of public education

and remember that it's our greatest collective responsibility

Luckily some of our communities are doing just that

The huge teacher strikes in the spring of  in Denver and LA 

they were successful because of community support

for things like smaller class sizes

and getting things into schools like more counselors

in addition to teacher pay

And sometimes for the student

innovation is just daring to implement common sense

In Baltimore a few years ago

they enacted a free breakfast and lunch program

taking away the stigma of poverty and hunger

for some students

but increasing achievement in attendance for many others

And in Memphis

the university is recruiting local passionate high school students

and giving them scholarships to go teach in the inner city

without the burden of college debt

And north of here in The Bronx

I recently researched these partnerships being built

between high schools community colleges and local businesses

who are creating internships in finance health care and technology

for students without silver spoon connections

to gain important skills

and contribute to the communities that they come from

So today I don't necessarily have the same questions about education

that I did when I was an idealistic perhaps nave college grad

working in a detention center basement

It's not Can schools save more of our students

Because I think we have the answer to that 

and it's yes they can if we save our schools first

We can start by caring about the education of other people's children 

And I'm saying that as someone who doesn't have kids yet

but wants to worry a little bit less about the future when I do

Cultivating as much talent as possible

getting as many girls as we can from all over

into science and engineering

as many boys as we can into teaching 

those are investments for our future

Our students are like our most valuable resource

and when you put it that way

our teachers are like our modernday diamond and gold miners

hoping to help make them shine

Let's contribute our voices

our votes and our support

to giving them the resources that they will need

not just to survive

but hopefully thrive

allowing all of us to do so as well

Thank you

Applause and cheers

Do you ever think about what would happen

if the world were a little bit different

How your life would be different

if you were born  years from now

instead of today

How history would be different

if the continents were at different latitudes

or how life in the Solar system would have developed

if the Sun were  percent larger

Well playing with these kinds of possibilities

is what I get to do for a living

but with the entire universe

I make model universes in a computer

Digital universes that have different starting points

and are made of different amounts of different kinds of material

And then I compare these universes to our own

to see what it is made of and how it evolved

This process of testing models with measurements of the sky

has taught us a huge amount about our universe so far

One of the strangest things we have learned

is that most of the material in the universe

is made of something entirely different than you and me

But without it

the universe as we know it wouldn't exist

Everything we can see with telescopes

makes up just about  percent of the total mass in the universe

Everything else  percent of it

doesn't emit or absorb light

We can't see it with our eyes

we can't detect it with radio waves

or microwaves or any other kind of light

But we know it is there

because of its influence on what we can see

It's a little bit like

if you wanted to map the surface of our planet

and everything on it

using this picture of the Earth from space at night

You get some clues from where the light is

but there's a lot that you can't see

everything from people to mountain ranges

And you have to infer what is there from these limited clues

We call this unseen stuff dark matter

Now a lot of people have heard of dark matter

but even if you have heard of it

it probably seems abstract

far away probably even irrelevant

Well the interesting thing is

dark matter is all around us

and probably right here

In fact dark matter particles

are probably going through your body right now

as you sit in this room

Because we are on Earth

and Earth is spinning around the Sun

and the Sun is hurtling through our galaxy

at about half a million miles per hour

But dark matter doesn't bump into us

it just goes right through us

So how do we figure out more about this

What is it

and what does it have to do with our existence

Well in order to figure out how we came to be

we first need to understand how our galaxy came to be

This is a picture of our galaxy the Milky Way today

What did it look like  billion years in the past

or what would it look like  billion years in the future

What about the stories

of the hundreds of millions of other galaxies

that we've already mapped out with large surveys of the sky

How would their histories be different

if the universe was made of something else

or if there was more or less matter in it

So the interesting thing about these model universes

is that they allow us to test these possibilities

Let's go back to the first moment of the universe 

just a fraction of a second after the big bang

In this first moment

there was no matter at all

The universe was expanding very fast

And quantum mechanics tells us

that matter is being created and destroyed

all the time in every moment

At this time the universe was expanding so fast

that the matter that got created couldn't get destroyed

And thus we think that all of the matter was created during this time

Both the dark matter

and the regular matter that makes up you and me

Now let's go a little bit further

to a time after the matter was created

after protons and neutrons formed

after hydrogen formed

about  years after the big bang

The universe was hot and dense and really smooth

but not perfectly smooth

This image taken with a space telescope called the Planck satellite

shows us the temperature of the universe

in all directions

And what we see

is that there were places that were a little bit hotter

and denser than others

The spots in this image

represent places where there was more or less mass in the early universe

Those spots got big because of gravity

The universe was expanding and getting less dense overall

over the last  billion years

But gravity worked hard in those spots

where there was a little bit more mass

and pulled more and more mass into those regions

Now all of this is a little hard to imagine

so let me just show you what I am talking about

Those computer models I mentioned allow us to test these ideas

so let's take a look at one of them

This movie made by my research group

shows us what happened to the universe after its earliest moments

You see the universe started out pretty smooth

but there were some regions

where there was a little bit more material

Gravity turned on and brought more and more mass

into those spots that started out with a little bit extra

Over time

you get enough stuff in one place

that the hydrogen gas

which was initially well mixed with the dark matter

starts to separate from it

cool down form stars

and you get a small galaxy

Over time over billions and billions of years

those small galaxies crash into each other

and merge and grow to become larger galaxies

like our own galaxy the Milky Way

Now what happens if you don't have dark matter

If you don't have dark matter

those spots never get clumpy enough

It turns out you need at least a million times the mass of the Sun

in one dense region

before you can start forming stars

And without dark matter

you never get enough stuff in one place

So here we're looking at two universes side by side

In one of them you can see

that things get clumpy quickly

In that universe

it's really easy to form galaxies

In the other universe

the things that start out like small clumps

they just stay really small

Not very much happens

In that universe you wouldn't get our galaxy

Or any other galaxy

You wouldn't get the Milky Way

you wouldn't get the Sun

you wouldn't get us

We just couldn't exist in that universe

OK so this crazy stuff dark matter

it's most of the mass in the universe

it's going through us right now we wouldn't be here without it

What is it

Well we have no idea

Laughter

But we have a lot of educated guesses

and a lot of ideas for how to find out more

So most physicists think that dark matter is a particle

similar in many ways to the subatomic particles that we know of

like protons and neutrons and electrons

Whatever it is

it behaves very similarly with respect to gravity

But it doesn't emit or absorb light

and it goes right through normal matter

as if it wasn't even there

We'd like to know what particle it is

For example how heavy is it

Or does anything at all happen if it interacts with normal matter

Physicists have lots of great ideas for what it could be

they're very creative

But it's really hard

because those ideas span a huge range

It could be as small as the smallest subatomic particles

or it could be as large as the mass of  Suns

So how do we figure out what it is

Well physicists and astronomers

have a lot of ways to look for dark matter

One of the things we're doing is building sensitive detectors

in deep underground mines

waiting for the possibility

that a dark matter particle which goes through us and the Earth

would hit a denser material

and leave behind some trace of its passage

We're looking for dark matter in the sky

for the possibility that dark matter particles

would crash into each other

and create highenergy light that we could see

with special gammaray telescopes

We're even trying to make dark matter here on Earth

by smashing particles together and looking for what happens

using the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland

Now so far

all of these experiments have taught us a lot

about what dark matter isn't

Laughter

but not yet what it is

There were really good ideas that dark matter could have been

that these experiments would have seen

And they didn't see them yet

so we have to keep looking and thinking harder

Now another way to get a clue to what dark matter is

is to study galaxies

We already talked about

how our galaxy and many other galaxies wouldn't even be here

without dark matter

Those models also make predictions

for many other things about galaxies

How they're distributed in the universe

how they move

how they evolve over time

And we can test those predictions with observations of the sky

So let me just give you two examples

of these kinds of measurements we can make with galaxies

The first is that we can make maps of the universe with galaxies

I am part of a survey called the Dark Energy Survey

which has made the largest map of the universe so far

We measured the positions and shapes of  million galaxies

over oneeighth of the sky

And this map is showing us all the matter in this region of the sky

which is inferred by the light distorted from these  million galaxies

The light distorted from all of the matter

that was between those galaxies and us

The gravity of the matter is strong enough to bend the path of light

And it gives us this image

So these kinds of maps

can tell us about how much dark matter there is

they also tell us where it is

and how it changes over time

So we're trying to learn about what the universe is made of

on the very largest scales

It turns out that the tiniest galaxies in the universe

provide some of the best clues

So why is that

Here are two example simulated universes

with two different kinds of dark matter

Both of these pictures are showing you a region

around a galaxy like the Milky Way

And you can see that there's a lot of other material around it

little small clumps

Now in the image on the right

dark matter particles are moving slower than they are in the one on the left

If those dark matter particles are moving really fast

then the gravity in small clumps is not strong enough

to slow those fast particles down

And they keep going

They never collapse into these small clumps

So you end up with fewer of them than in the universe on the right

If you don't have those small clumps

then you get fewer small galaxies

If you look up at the southern sky

you can actually see two of these small galaxies

the largest of the small galaxies that are orbiting our Milky Way

the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud

In the last several years

we have detected a whole bunch more even smaller galaxies

This is an example of one of them

that we detected with the same dark energy survey

that we used to make maps of the universe

These really small galaxies

some of them are extremely small

Some of them have as few as a few hundred stars

compared to the few hundred billion stars in our Milky Way

So that makes them really hard to find

But in the last decade

we've actually found a whole bunch more of these

We now know of  of these tiny galaxies

that are orbiting our own Milky Way

And these little guys are a big clue to dark matter

Because just the existence of these galaxies tells us

that dark matter can't be moving very fast

and not much can be happening when it runs into normal matter

In the next several years

we're going to make much more precise maps of the sky

And those will help refine our movies

of the whole universe and the entire galaxy

Physicists are also making new more sensitive experiments

to try to catch some sign of dark matter in their laboratories

Dark matter is still a huge mystery

But it's a really exciting time to be working on it

We have really clear evidence it exists

From the scale of the smallest galaxies

to the scale of the whole universe

Will we actually find it and figure out what it is

I have no idea

But it's going to be a lot of fun to find out

We have a lot of possibilities for discovery

and we definitely will learn more about what it is doing

and about what it isn't

Regardless of whether we find that particle anytime soon

I hope I have convinced you

that this mystery is actually really close to home

The search for dark matter

may just be the key to a whole new understanding of physics

and our place in the universe

Thank you

There was a time when simple infections were deadly

but now thanks to the wide availability of antibiotics

this is merely a relic of the past

But actually I should say was

because nowadays we're using antibiotics so much

that the bacteria that cause these infections

are becoming resistant

And that should really scare the hell out of all of us

If we do not change our behavior and wean ourselves off antibiotics

the UN predicts that by 

antimicrobial resistance will become our single biggest killer

So we must start to act

But where to begin is an interesting question

because we humans are not the only ones using antibiotics

Worldwide  to  percent of all antibiotics are used by animals

Not all of these are critical for human health

but if we do not get it under control right now

we're looking at a very scary future for humans and animals alike

To begin let's talk about how we ended up here

The first largescale use of antibiotics was in the early 's of the last century

In the Western world prosperity was increasing

and people wanted to eat more animal protein

When animals were sick you could now treat them with antibiotics

so they did not die and kept growing

But soon it was discovered

that adding small and regular amounts of antibiotics to the feed

kept the animals healthy

made them grow faster

and caused them to need less feed

So these antibiotics worked well 

really well actually

And with increasing animal production

also antibiotic use skyrocketed worldwide

Unfortunately so did antibiotic resistance

The reason your doctor tells you to finish the entire bottle of antibiotics

is if you shorten your dose you will not kill all of the bugs

And the ones that stick around build up the antibiotic resistance

It's the same problem with giving animals small and regular doses of antibiotics

some bad bugs die but not all of them

Spread that across an entire industry

and you can understand that we accidentally build up

a large reservoir of antibioticresistant bacteria

But I hate to break it to you 

the problem doesn't stop there

You know who else takes antibiotics

Fluffy your cat and Rover your dog

Laughter

Pets rank even amongst the heaviest users of all

and they use antibiotics

that are much more critical for human health

Combine this with how close we live with our companion animals

and you understand the risk

of you picking up antibioticresistant bacteria from your own pet

But how do these antibioticresistant bacteria

in farm animals affect you

Let me give you an example we have actually data on

The levels of antibioticresistant salmonella in pigs in Europe

against different types of antibiotics

range from less than a percent to as high [as]  percent

Which means that in most cases

this antibiotic will not work anymore to kill this salmonella

And there was a high correlation

between antibioticresistant salmonella in the pig

and in the final product

Whether that is pork chop

spare ribs or minced meat

Now luckily typically less than one percent

of all raw meat fish or eggs

will contain salmonella

And this only poses a risk when not treated well

Still there are over  human salmonella cases in the EU

and more than a million cases in the US

In the US leading to  hospitalizations

and  people dead each year

With antibioticresistant salmonella on the rise

this death toll is likely to increase

But it's not only about consuming yourself

This year more than  people got infected

with a multidrugresistant salmonella

after feeding pig ears as a treat to their dog

So we really must cut back on antibiotic use in animal production

And luckily this is starting to happen

The EU was the first region to ban

putting antibiotics in low doses in the feed

From ' on in several steps

the amount of different types of antibiotics allowed was reduced

and in  a complete ban went into place

Antibiotics were only allowed

when a veterinarian determined the animal was sick

Sounds great right

Problem solved

No wait not so fast

As soon as the reduction program started

it was very quickly discovered

that antibiotics had been the perfect blanket

to cover up a lot of bad farm practices

More and more animals became sick

and needed to be cured with  antibiotics

So instead of the total amount going down

it actually increased

Surely that was not the way to go

But luckily that was not the end of the story

The whole European agricultural sector started on a journey

and I think it's a journey anybody can learn from

This is also the time I personally entered the scene

I joined a large European feed compounder

A feed compounder makes a total diet for a farmer to feed to his animals

and often also provides the advice

on how to raise the animals in the best way

I was really motivated to work together with my colleagues

veterinarians and of course the farmers

to figure out how to keep the animals healthy and antibioticfree

Now there are three major things that need to happen

for antibioticfree production

Let me walk you through the playbook

To start  and it sounds very obvious 

that our hygiene is the place to start

Better cleaning of the stable and the drinkingwater lines

making it harder for the disease to come in and spread across the stable

That's all very important

but the part I was personally most interested in

was better feeding for the animals

better nutrition

Feeding a wellbalanced diet is important

Think about it this way

when you yourself do not eat enough fiber you do not feel well

Part of the food you consume is not digested by yourself

but fermented in your large intestine by bacteria

So you're feeding those microbes with part of your diet

Initially most young animals were fed lowfiber

highstarch and protein

very finely ground and highly digestible diets

Like being yourself on a diet of hamburger buns

rice waffles and protein bars

We changed this to a lowerprotein

higherfiber coarser type of diet

Like being on a diet of whole grains salad with meat or beans

This shifted the bacterial flora in the animals' guts

to the more beneficial ones

and reduced the chance that pathogens would flourish

You might be surprised

but not only diet composition also diet structure plays a role

Simply the fact that the same diet is coarser

will lead to a betterdeveloped digestive tract

and thus a healthier animal

But the best part was that farmers started to buy this actually too

Unlike some other parts of the world

Western European farmers mainly still make their independent buying decisions

who to buy the feed from and sell their animals to

So what you're actually selling in the end

reflects the actual local need of these farmers

For example

the protein content in piglet diets

in countries that are much more vigilant in reducing antibiotics

like for example Germany and the Netherlands

were already  to  percent lower

than in a country like the UK which was slower to pick this up

But like with better hygiene better nutrition helps

but will not totally prevent you from becoming sick

So more is needed

And that's why we turned to the microbiome

Making the water with the feed more acidic

helps to create an environment

that benefits the more beneficial bacteria

and inhibits the pathogens

Like fermented food

whether it's yogurt sauerkraut or salami

they'll all spoil less quickly too

Now with modern techniques

like the ones based on DNA testing
DNA
we can see that there are many more different microorganisms present

And this ecosystem which we call the microbiome

is much more complex

Turns out there are about eight times more microorganisms in your gut

as tissue cells in your body

And for animals the impact is no less

So if we want to work without antibiotics in animal production

we have to make the animals much more robust

So that when a disease strikes

the animals are much more resilient

And this threepronged nutribiosis approach

involving the host nutrition and the microbiome

is the way to do it

Now the practice of raising animals on an antibioticcontaining

or antibioticuseprovoking diet is a bit cheaper at farm level

But in the end we are talking about a few percent at the consumer level

That's actually quite affordable

for the middle and highincome part of the world population

And a very small price to pay

when our own health or our loved ones' health is at stake

So what do you think what direction do we take

Do we allow antimicrobial resistance to become our biggest killer

at huge financial and a special personal cost

Or do we besides reducing human antibiotic consumption

truly start embracing antibioticfree animal production

For me the choice is very obvious

But to make this happen

we have to set reduction targets

and make sure that they're followed all around the world

Because farmers compete with each other

And at a country level

trading block or the global market

costs are very important

And also we have to be realistic

Farmers need to have the possibilities

to invest more in better management and better feed

in order to achieve this reduction

And besides legal limits the market can play a role

by offering antibioticreduced or antibioticfree products

And with growing consumer awareness

these market forces will increase in power

Now everything I've been talking about seems to be great for us

But what about the animals

Now guess what their lives get better too

Better health less stress happier life

So now you know

We have the knowledge how to produce meat eggs and milk

without or with very low amounts of antibiotics

and I'll argue it's a small price to pay

to avoid a future in which bacterial infections

again become our biggest killer

Thank you

We've all heard about how the dinosaurs died

The story I'm going to tell you

happened over  million years before the dinosaurs went extinct

This story starts at the very beginning

when dinosaurs were just getting their start

One of the biggest mysteries in evolutionary biology

is why dinosaurs were so successful

What led to their global dominance for so many years

When people think about why dinosaurs were so amazing

they usually think about the biggest or the smallest dinosaur

or who was the fastest

or who had the most feathers

the most ridiculous armor spikes or teeth

But perhaps the answer had to do with their internal anatomy 

a secret weapon so to speak

My colleagues and I we think it was their lungs

I am both a paleontologist and a comparative anatomist

and I am interested in understanding

how the specialized dinosaur lung helped them take over the planet

So we are going to jump back over  million years

to the Triassic period

The environment was extremely harsh

there were no flowering plants

so this means that there was no grass

So imagine a landscape filled with all pine trees and ferns

At the same time there were small lizards

mammals insects

and there were also carnivorous and herbivorous reptiles 

all competing for the same resources

Critical to this story

is that oxygen levels have been estimated to have been as low as  percent

compared to today's  percent

So it would have been crucial for dinosaurs to be able to breathe

in this lowoxygen environment

not only to survive

but to thrive and to diversify

So how do we know what dinosaur lungs were even like

since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is its fossilized skeleton

The method that we use is called extant phylogenetic bracketing

This is a fancy way of saying that we study the anatomy 

specifically in this case the lungs and skeleton 

of the living descendants of dinosaurs on the evolutionary tree

So we would look at the anatomy of birds

who are the direct descendants of dinosaurs

and we'd look at the anatomy of crocodilians

who are their closest living relatives

and then we would look at the anatomy of lizards and turtles

who we can think of like their cousins

And then we apply these anatomical data to the fossil record

and then we can use that to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs

And in this specific instance

the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely resembles that of modern birds

So because dinosaurs were competing with early mammals during this time period

it's important to understand the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung

Also to reintroduce you to lungs in general

we will use my dog Mila of Troy
Mila
the face that launched a thousand treats

as our model

Laughter

This story takes place inside of a chest cavity

So I want you to visualize the ribcage of a dog

Think about how the spinal vertebral column

is completely horizontal to the ground

This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be

in all of the animals that we'll be talking about

whether they walked on two legs

or four legs

Now I want you to climb inside of the imaginary ribcage and look up

This is our thoracic ceiling

This is where the top surface of the lungs comes into direct contact

with the ribs and vertebrae

This interface is where our story takes place

Now I want you to visualize the lungs of a dog

On the outside it's like a giant inflatable bag

where all parts of the bag expand during inhalation

and contract during exhalation

Inside of the bag there's a series of branching tubes

and these tubes are called the bronchial tree

These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen to ultimately the alveolus

They cross over a thin membrane into the bloodstream by diffusion

Now this part is critical

The entire mammalian lung is mobile

That means it's moving during the entire respiratory process

so that thin membrane the bloodgas barrier

cannot be too thin or it will break

Now remember the bloodgas barrier because we will be returning to this

So you're still with me

Because we're going to start birds and it gets crazy

so hold on to your butts

Laughter

The bird is completely different from the mammal

And we are going to be using birds as our model

to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs

So in the bird

air passes through the lung but the lung does not expand or contract

The lung is immobilized

it has the texture of a dense sponge

and it's inflexible and locked into place on the top and sides by the ribcage

and on the bottom by a horizontal membrane

It is then unidirectionally ventilated

by a series of flexible baglike structures

that branch off of the bronchial tree

beyond the lung itself

and these are called air sacs

Now this entire extremely delicate setup is locked into place

by a series of forked ribs

all along the thoracic ceiling

Also in many species of birds

extensions arise from the lung

and the air sacs

they invade the skeletal tissues 

usually the vertebrae sometimes the ribs 

and they lock the respiratory system into place

And this is called vertebral pneumaticity

The forked ribs and the vertebral pneumaticity

are two clues that we can hunt for in the fossil record

because these two skeletal traits

would indicate that regions of the respiratory system of dinosaurs

are immobilized

This anchoring of the respiratory system

facilitated the evolution of the thinning of the bloodgas barrier

that thin membrane over which oxygen was diffusing into the bloodstream

The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier

and the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated

like a mammalian lung

So why do we care about this

Why does this even matter

Oxygen more easily diffuses across a thin membrane

and a thin membrane is one way of enhancing respiration

under lowoxygen conditions 

lowoxygen conditions like that of the Triassic period

So if dinosaurs did indeed have this type of lung

they'd be better equipped to breathe than all other animals

including mammals

So do you remember the extant phylogenetic bracket method

where we take the anatomy of modern animals

and we apply that to the fossil record

So clue number one was the forked ribs of modern birds

Well we find that in pretty much the majority of dinosaurs

So that means that the top surface of the lungs of dinosaurs

would be locked into place

just like modern birds

Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity

We find this in sauropod dinosaurs and theropod dinosaurs

which is the group that contains predatory dinosaurs

and gave rise to modern birds

And while we don't find evidence of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs

vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence of what the lung was doing

during the life of these animals

Lung tissue or air sac tissue was invading the vertebrae

hollowing them out just like a modern bird

and locking regions of the respiratory system into place

immobilizing them

The forked ribs

and the vertebral pneumaticity together

were creating an immobilized rigid framework

that locked the respiratory system into place

that permitted the evolution of that superthin superdelicate bloodgas barrier

that we see today in modern birds

Evidence of this straightjacketed lung in dinosaurs

means that they had the capability to evolve a lung

that would have been able to breathe

under the hypoxic or lowoxygen atmosphere of the Triassic period

This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs would have given them

a significant adaptive advantage over other animals particularly mammals

whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted

to the hypoxic or lowoxygen atmosphere of the Triassic

This anatomy may have been the secret weapon of dinosaurs

that gave them that advantage over other animals

And this gives us an excellent launchpad

to start testing the hypotheses of dinosaurian diversification

This is the story of the dinosaurs' beginning

and it's just the beginning of the story of our research into this subject

Thank you

I will lend books to people but of course the rule is

Don't do that unless you never intend to see that book again

[Small thing]
[
[Big idea]
[]
The physical object of a book is almost like a person

I mean it has a spine and it has a backbone

It has a face

Actually it can sort of be your friend

Books record the basic human experience

like no other medium can

Before there were books

ancient civilizations would record things

by notches on bones or rocks or what have you

The first books as we know them originated in ancient Rome

We go by a term called the codex
codex
where they would have two heavy pieces of wood

which become the cover

and then the pages in between would then be stitched along one side

to make something that was relatively easily transportable

They all had to completely be done by hand

which became the work of what we know as a scribe

And frankly they were luxury items

And then a printer named Johannes Gutenberg

in the midfifteenth century created the means to massproduce a book

the modern printing press

It wasn't until then

that there was any kind of consumption of books by a large audience

Book covers started to come into use in the early nineteenth century

and they were called dust wrappers

They usually had advertising on them

So people would take them off and throw them away

It wasn't until the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth century

that book jackets could be seen as interesting design

in and of themselves

Such that I look at that and I think

I want to read that

That interests me

The physical book itself represents both a technological advance

but also a piece of technology in and of itself

It delivered a user interface

that was unlike anything that people had before

And you could argue that it's still the best way

to deliver that to an audience

I believe that the core purpose of a physical book

is to record our existence

and to leave it behind on a shelf in a library in a home

for generations down the road to understand where they came from

that people went through some of the same things

that they're going through

and it's like a dialogue that you have with the author

I think you have a much more human relationship to a printed book

than you do to one that's on a screen

People want the experience of holding it

of turning the page of marking their progress in a story

And then you have of all things the smell of a book

Fresh ink on paper or the aging paper smell

You don't really get that from anything else

The book itself you know can't be turned off with a switch

It's a story that you can hold in your hand

and carry around with you

and that's part of what makes them so valuable

and I think will make them valuable for the duration

A shelf of books frankly

is made to outlast you Laughs

no matter who you are

Almost  years ago

my country was facing the need to rebuild everything from scratch

After years of Soviet occupation

Estonia regained its independence but we were left with nothing

No infrastructure no administration no legal code

Organizational chaos

Out of necessity

the state leaders back then had to make some daring choices

The ones that our country could afford

There was a lot of experimentation and uncertainty

but also a bit of luck involved

particularly in the fact that we could count on a number

of brilliant visionaries

cryptographers and engineers

I was just a kid back then

Today we are called the most digital society on earth

I'm from Estonia

and we've been declaring taxes online since 

We have been using digital identity and signature since 

We've been voting online since 

And for today pretty much the whole range of the public services

that you can imagine

education police justice starting a company

applying for benefits looking at your health record

or challenging a parking ticket 

that's everything that is done online

In fact it's much easier to tell you

what are the three things we cannot yet do online

We have to show up to pick up our ID documents

get married or divorced

or sell real estate

That's pretty much it

So that's why don't freak out

when I tell you that every year

I can't wait to start doing my tax declaration

Laughter

Because all I have to do

is sit on my couch with a mobile phone

swipe a few pages with prefilled data on income and deductions

and hit submit

After three minutes

I'm looking at the tax return amount

It actually feels like a quite rewarding experience

No tax advisors

no collecting receipts

no doing the math

And have I mentioned that I have not visited a state office

for almost seven years

Indeed one of the features of the modern life

that has no reason to exist anymore

considering technological possibilities of today

is the labyrinth of bureaucracy

We've almost got rid of it completely in Estonia

in an effort coordinated by the government that has also digitized itself

For instance cabinet of ministers' work in eCabinet is absolutely paperless

The central idea behind this development

is transformation of the state role

and digitalization of trust

Think about it

In most countries people don't trust their governments

And the governments don't trust them back

And all the complicated paperbased formal procedures

are supposed to solve that problem

Except that they don't

They just make life more complicated

I believe Estonian experience is showing that technology can be the remedy

for getting the trust back

while creating an efficient

usercentric service delivery system

that actively responds to citizens' needs

We did not do it by digitizing bureaucracy as it is

But by rather agreeing on a few strong common principles

redesigning rules and procedures

getting rid of unnecessary data collection

and task duplication

and becoming open and transparent

Let me give you a glimpse

into some of the key eEstonia design principles today
e
First it is essential to guarantee privacy and confidentiality

of data and information

This is achieved through a strong digital identity

that is issued by the state

and compatible with everything

In fact every Estonian has one

The identity is doubled with a strong digital signature

that is accepted used and legally binding

both in Estonia and the European Union

When the system can properly and securely identify who is using it

after logging in it will provide access to the personal data of the citizen

and all the public services within one tool

and allow to authorize anything by signing digitally

A second principle and one of the most transformative

is called Once only

It means that the state cannot ask for the same data

more than once

nor can store it in more than one place

For instance

if you've already provided your birth or marital certificate

to the population registry

this is the only place where this data is going to be held

And no other institution will be ever asking for it again

Once only is a very powerful rule

as it defines the whole structure of the data collection in a country

what information is collected

and who is responsible for maintaining it

making sure we avoid centralization of data

duplication of data

and guarantee that it's actually up to date

This distributed approach also avoids the problem

of the single point of failure

But since the data cannot be replicated

or collected more than once

it means that the design has to keep in mind

secure and robust access to that information at all times

so the public institution can offer a service

This is exactly the role of the data exchange platform

called the XRoad
X
that has been in use since 

Just like a highway

it connects public sector databases and registries

local municipalities and businesses

organizing a realtime secure and regulated data exchange

saving an auditable trace after each move

Here's a screenshot of a live feed

showing all the requests performed on the XRoad
XRoad
and all the services that it actually facilitates

And this is the real picture

of all the connections between public and private sector databases

As you can see

there is no central database whatsoever

Confidentiality and privacy are definitely very important

But in the digital world

reliability and integrity of information

is just critical for operations

For instance

if someone changes your medical health record

let's say allergies

without you or your doctor knowing

treatment could be deadly

That's why in a digital society a system like an Estonian one

when there's almost no paper originals

there's almost only digital originals

integrity of data

data exchange rules software components

and log files is paramount

We use a form of blockchain that we invented back in 

way before blockchain even became a thing

to check and guarantee the integrity of data in real time

Blockchain is our auditor

and a promise that no access to the data

or data manipulation remains unrecorded

Data ownership is another key principle in the design of the system

Aren't you worried by the fact that governments tech companies

and other businesses around the world

claim data they've collected about you is theirs

generally refuse to give access to that information

and often fail to prove how it was used

or shared with third parties

I don't know for me it seems like a quite disturbing situation

The Estonian system is based on the principle

that an individual is the owner of the data collected about him

thus has an absolute right to know what information is collected

and who has been accessing it

Every time a policeman a doctor or any state officer

is accessing personal information of the citizens online

first they only get to access it after logging in

to the information they're authorized to see to do their job

And secondly every time they're making requests

this is saved in a log file

This detailed log file is part of the state public services

and allows real transparency

making sure no privacy violation will remain unnoticed to the citizen

Now of course this is only a simplified summary

of all the design principles that eEstonia is built on
e
And now government is building up

to get ready for use of artificial intelligence

and building a whole new generation of public services 

proactive services

that would activate seamlessly

based on different life situations that people might be in

such as childbirth unemployment or starting a business

Now of course

running a digital society with no paper backup

can be an issue right

Even though we trust our systems to be solid

but one can never be too cautious as we experienced back in 

when the first cyberincident happened

and it literally blocked part of our networks

making access to the services impossible for hours

We survived

But this event put cybersecurity at the very top of agenda

both in terms of strengthening the platform and backing it up

So how do you back up a countrywide system in a small state

where everything is super close

Well for instance you can export a copy of the data

outside the country territory

to an extraterritorial space of an embassy

Today we have those data embassies

that are holding the most critical digital assets of Estonia

guaranteeing continuity of operations

protection of our data

and most importantly our sovereignty

Even in case of a physical attack on our territory

Some of you might be thinking by now

Where are the downsides

Well going all digital

is administratively and let's be honest financially more efficient

Interfacing primarily with computer systems

might create an impression that the human factor

elected politicians

and participating in democratic processes

is somehow less important

And there are also some people

who feel threatened by pervasive technology

that might make their skills obsolete

So all in all unfortunately

running a country on a digital platform

has not saved us from political power struggles

and polarization in the society

as we have seen in the last elections

Well until there are humans involved

One last question

If everything is locationindependent

and I can access all of the services from anywhere in the world

why cannot others tap into some of these services

even if they don't reside within Estonian borders

Five years ago

we launched a governmental startup called eResidency program
eResidence Program
that for today joins tens of thousands of people

These are businessmen and women from  different countries

who establish their businesses digitally

who do their banking online

and who run their companies virtually over eEstonia platform
eEstania
within European Union legal framework

using an eidentity card similar to mine

and all of that from anywhere in the world

The Estonian system is locationindependent

and usercentric

It prioritizes inclusiveness openness and reliability

It puts security and transparency at its center

And the data into the hands of the rightful owner

the person they refer to

Don't take my word for it

Try it

Thank you

So I have a background in technology and magic

And magicians are interesting

Their illusions accomplish what technology cannot

But what happens when the technology of the day

seems almost magical

What happens when you can do this

Music

Now  years ago

that would have been the magic of levitation

Is it possible to create illusions

in a world where technology makes anything possible

Jump

Now if you know how the trick is done

where is the illusion

But still our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning

and it's easy to attribute personality to machines

These are quadcopters

But they are more than mechanical flying machines

They analyze the environment around them

and react to everything I do

At once algorithms allow these autonomous machines to fly in close formation

aware of each other

and aware of me 

mathematics that can be mistaken for intelligence

and intelligence for personality

Anthropomorphism that's the illusion

an illusion created by technology

and embroidered by our imagination

to become an intelligent flying robot

a machine that appears to be alive

Music plays Close Encounters of the Third Kind

Quadcopters make tones

I think they say Hello

Hey guys Come on
 
And time to land

And that's it

Thank you

Applause

OK guys time to go home

Everybody in here

Come on everybody quickly quickly

No pushing everybody can fit

There you go a little bit to the left a little bit to the right

Come on everybody everybody

and  good job

Cheers

It was about two years after Hurricane Katrina

that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps

These flood maps are used to show land loss in the past

and land loss that is to come

On this particular day at a community meeting

these maps were used to explain

how a foot tidal surge that accompanied Hurricane Katrina

could flood communities like mine in south Louisiana

and communities across the Mississippi and Alabama coast

It turns out that the land we were losing was our buffer from the sea

I volunteered to interact with the graphics on the wall

and in an instant my life changed for the second time in two years

The graphic showed massive land loss in south Louisiana

and an encroaching sea

but more specifically the graphic showed the disappearance of my community

and many other communities before the end of the century

I wasn't alone at the front of the room

I was standing there with other members of south Louisiana's communities 

black Native poor

We thought we were just bound by temporary disaster recovery

but we found that we were now bound by the impossible task

of ensuring that our communities would not be erased by sea level rise

due to climate change

Friends neighbors family my community

I just assumed it would always be there

Land trees marsh bayous

I just assumed that it would be there as it had been for thousands of years

I was wrong

To understand what was happening to my community

I had to talk to other communities around the globe

I started in south Louisiana with the United Houma Nation

I talked to youth advocates in Shishmaref Alaska
Shishmaref
I talked to fisherwomen in coastal Vietnam

justice fighters in Fiji

new generations of leaders

in the ancient cultures of the Torres Straits

Communities that had been here for thousands of years

were suffering the same fate

and we were all contemplating how we would survive the next 

By the end of the next century

it's predicted that more than  million people

will be displaced due to climate change

and in south Louisiana

those who can afford to do so are already moving

They're moving because south Louisiana is losing land

at one of the fastest rates on the planet

Disappearance is what my bayou community

has in common with other coastal communities

Erasure is what communities around the globe are fighting

as we get real about the impacts of climate change

I've spent the last  years advocating on behalf of communities

that have been directly impacted by the climate crisis

These communities are fighting discrimination

within climate disaster recovery

and they're also trying to balance mass displacement of people

with an influx of others

who see opportunity in starting anew

Since  people have been called refugees

when they leave when they're displaced by climate disaster

even when they don't cross international borders

These terms these misused terms

that are meant to identify the other

the victim

the person who is not supposed to be here

these terms are barriers

to economic recovery

to social integration

and to the healing required from the climate crisis and climate trauma

Words matter

It also matters how we treat people who are crossing borders

We should care about how people who are crossing borders today

to seek refuge and safety are being treated

if for no other reason than it might be you or someone you love

who needs to exercise their human right to migrate

in the nearby future

We must start preparing for global migration today

It's a reality now

Our cities and our communities are not prepared

In fact our economic system and our social systems

are only prepared to make profit off of people who migrate

This will cause rounds of climate gentrification

and it will also penalize the movement of people

usually through exploited labor

and usually through criminalization

Climate gentrification that happens in anticipation of sea level rise

is what we're seeing in places like Miami

where communities that were kept from the waterfront

are now being priced out of the high ground

where they were placed originally

as people move away from the coast

These folks are being moved forced to relocate away

from the social and economic systems that they need to survive

Climate gentrification also happens in the aftermath of climate disaster

When massive amounts of people leave a location

for an indefinite amount of time

we see others come in

We also see climate gentrification happen

when damaged homes are now green built

but now have a higher value

generally outside of the reach of black and brown and poor people

who want to return home

The price difference in rents or the ownership of a house

is the difference between being able to practice your right

your human right to return home as a community

or be forced to resettle somewhere else

less climate resilient

less expensive

and alone

The climate crisis is a much larger conversation

than reducing CO emissions

and it is a much different conversation than just extreme weather

We're facing a shift in every aspect of our global reality

And climate migration is just one small part

but it's going to have ripple effects

in both coastal cities and cities in the interior

So what do we do

I have a few ideas

Laughter

First we must reframe our understanding of the problem

Climate change is not the problem

Climate change is the most horrible symptom

of an economic system

that has been built for a few

to extract every precious value out of this planet and its people

from our natural resources

to the fruits of our human labor

This system has created this crisis

Applause

We must have the courage to admit we've taken too much

We cannot close our eyes to the fact

that the entire world is paying a price

for the privilege and comfort of just a few people on the planet

It's time for us to make societywide changes

to a system that incentivizes consumption

to the point of global imbalance

Our social political and economic systems of extraction

must be transformed into systems that regenerate the earth

and advance human liberty globally

It is arrogance to think that technology will save us

It is ego to think that we can continue

this unjust and extractive approach to living on this planet

and survive

Applause

To survive this next phase of our human existence

we will need to restructure our social and economic systems

to develop our collective resilience

The social restructuring must be towards restoration and repair

of the earth

and the communities that have been extracted from

criminalized

and targeted for generations

These are the frontlines

This is where we start

We must establish a new social attitude to see migration as a benefit

a necessity for our global survival

not as a threat to our individual privilege

Collective resilience means developing cities that can receive people

and provide housing

food water health care

and the freedom from overpolicing

for everyone

no matter who they are

no matter where they're from

What would it mean if we started to plan for climate migration now

Sprawling cities or declining cities could see this as an opportunity

to rebuild a social infrastructure rooted in justice and fairness

We could actually put money into public hospitals

and help them prepare

for what is to come through climate migration

including the trauma that comes with loss and relocation

We can invest more of our time in justice

but it cannot be for temporary gain

it cannot be to help budget shortfalls

it has to be for longterm change

and it has to be to advance justice

It's already possible y'all

After Hurricane Katrina

universities and high schools around the US took in students

to help them finish their semester or their year without missing a beat

Those students are now productive assets in our community

and this is what our communities our businesses and our institutions

need to get ready for now

The time is now

So as we reframe the problem in a more truthful way

and we restructure our social systems in a more just way

all that will be left is for us to reindigenize ourselves

and to conjure a power of the most ancient kind

This necessarily means that we must learn to follow 

not tokenize not exotify not dismiss 

the leadership and the traditional knowledge

of a particular local place

It means that we must commit to standards of ecological equity

and climate justice and human rights

as the basis a base standard

a starting point

for where our new society is to go

All of this requires us to recognize a power greater than ourselves

and a life longer than the ones we will live

It requires us to believe in the things that we are privileged enough

not to have to see

We must honor the rights of nature

We must advance human rights for all

We must transform from a disposable

individual society

into one that sees our collective longterm humanity

or else we will not make it

We must see that even the best of us are entangled in an unjust system

and we must acknowledge

that the only way you're going to survive

is for us to figure out

how to reach a shared liberation together

The good news is

we come from powerful people

We come from those who have in one way or another

survived so far to be us here today

This is reason enough to fight

And take it from your south Louisiana friend

those hardest fights are the ones to celebrate

Let's choose to make this next phase of our planetary existence beautiful

and while we're at it

let's make it just and fair for everyone

We can do this y'all

We can do this

because we must

We must or else we lose our planet

and we lose ourselves

The work starts here

The work starts together

This is my offering

Thank you for receiving it Merci

I started life as a fashion designer

working closely with textile designers and fabric suppliers

But today I can no longer see or talk to my new collaborators

because they're in the soil beneath our feet

on the shelves of our supermarkets

and in the beer I'm going to drink when I finish this talk

I'm talking about microbes

and designing with life

Fifteen years ago

I completely changed both what I worked with

and how I worked

after a revelatory collaboration with a biologist

Our project gave me a different perspective on life

introducing a whole new world of possibility

around how we can design and make things

I discovered a radical manufacturing proposition

biofabrication

Literally fabricating with biology

What does that mean

Well instead of processing plants animals or oil

to make consumer materials

we might grow materials directly with living organisms

In what many are terming the Fourth Industrial Revolution

we're thinking about the new factories as being living cells

Bacteria algae fungi yeast

our latest design tools include those of biotechnology

My own journey in biofabrication

started with a project called Biocouture

The provocation was that instead of growing a plant like cotton

in a field over several months

we could use microbes to grow a similar cellulose material in a lab

in a few days

Using a certain species of bacteria in a nutrientrich liquid

we fermented threads of cellulose

that selforganized into a sheet of fabric

I dried the fabric I had grown

and cut and sewed it into a range of garments shoes and bags

In other words in one lab we grew materials

and turned them into a range of products

in a matter of days

And this is in contrast to currents methods of fabric production

where a plant is grown

just the cotton part is harvested

processed into a yarn

woven into a fabric

and then potentially shipped across oceans

before being cut and sewn into a garment

All of that can take months

So these prototypes indicated a field

offering significant resource efficiencies

From reducing the water energy and chemistry needed

in the production of a material

through to generating zero waste

we grew fabrics to finished form 

if you like biological additive manufacture

Through biofabrication

I had replaced many intensive manmade steps

with one biological step

And as I engaged with this living system

it transformed my design thinking

Here was biology with no intervention from me

other than designing initial conditions for growth

efficiently producing a useful sustainable material

So now I can't help but see all materials through the lens of biofabrication

In fact there's a growing global community of innovators

rethinking materials with biology

Multiple companies are now growing mushroom materials

but not literally mushrooms 

using mycelium which is the root system of fungi

to bind together agricultural byproducts

It's a process that's been described as nature's glue

A common way to do this is to take a D mold

fill it with a waste crop like corn stalks or hemp

add water

wait a few days for the mycelium to grow throughout

remove the mold

and you're left with a grown D form

Incredibly we can grow all kinds of structures

using living organisms

from foams that can replace plastics in footwear

to leatherlike materials without animals

Furniture flooring  all are currently being prototyped

Fungi are able to grow materials that are naturally fire retardant

without any chemicals

They're naturally hydrophobic

meaning they won't absorb water

They have higher melt temperatures than plastics

Polystyrene can take thousands of years to degrade

Mushroom packaging materials

can be naturally composted in your back garden

in as little as  days

Living organisms are transforming waste

into costcompetitive performancematching materials

that can start to replace plastics

and other COemitting materials

And once we start growing materials with living organisms

it starts to make previous methods of manufacture seem illogical

Take the humble house brick

The cement industry generates around eight percent

of global CO emissions

That's more than all the planes and ships each year

The cement process requires materials to be fired in a kiln

at over  degrees Fahrenheit

Compare this to bioMASON
bioMASON
They use a soil microbe to transform loose aggregates

like sand or crushed stone

into a biofabricated or biocement brick

Their process happens at room temperature

in just a couple of days

Think hydroponics for bricks

An irrigation system feeds nutrientrich water

to trays of bricks

that have been inoculated with bacteria

The bacteria produce crystals

that form around each grain of sand

locking together all the loose particles

to form a solid brick

We can now grow construction materials

in the elegant way nature does

just like a coral reef

And these biofabricated bricks are nearly three times stronger

than a concrete block

And in stark contrast to traditional cement production

they store more carbon than they make

So if we could replace the  trillion fired bricks

that are made each year

with biofabricated bricks

we could reduce CO emissions

by  million tons every year

Applause

Beyond growing materials with living organisms

we're even starting to design products

that encourage their growth

And this comes from the realization

that the very thing we've been trying to marginalize  life 

might actually be our greatest collaborator

To that end we've been exploring all the ways

that we can grow healthy microbes in our own ecosystems

A great example of this is architects

who are imagining the skin of a building

to function like the bark of a tree

But not as a cosmetic green layer

They're designing architectural barks

as hosts for evolving ecologies

These surface structures are designed to invite life in

And if we applied the same energy we currently do suppressing forms of life

towards cultivating life

we'd turn the negative image of the urban jungle

into one that literally embodies a thriving living ecosystem

By actively encouraging surface interactions with healthy microbes

we could improve passive climate control

stormwater management

and even reduce CO emissions

by lowering the energy used to heat or cool our buildings

We're just beginning to realize the potential

of naturebased technologies

I'm excited that we're starting to design and biofabricate

a new material world

It's one that moves away from the exploitation

of nonrenewable resources

to working with the original renewable life

Instead of designing out life

we're designing with it and for it

Packaging fashion footwear furniture construction 

biofabricated products can be grown close to centers of demand

with local resources less land energy

and even harnessing industrial waste streams

It used to be that the tools of biotechnology

were the preserve of powerful

multinational chemical and biotech companies

In the last century we expected material innovation

to come from the likes of DuPont Dow BASF

But this stcentury material revolution is being led by startups

with small teams and limited capital

And by the way not all their founders have science degrees

They include artists architects and designers

Over a billion dollars has already been invested

in startups biofabricating consumer products

I don't think we have a choice but to biofabricate our future

to the chair you're sitting in

to the home you live in

your designed material world shouldn't compromise your health

or that of our planet

If materials can't be recycled

or naturally composted at home

we should reject them

I'm committed to making this future a reality

by shining a light on all the amazing work

being done today

and by facilitating more interactions

between designers scientists investors and brands

Because we need a material revolution

and we need it now

Thank you

By October 

Juan Carlos Rivera could no longer afford

to live in his home in Copan Honduras

As the Dallas Morning News reported

a gang was taking  percent of his earnings from his barber shop

His wife was assaulted going to her preK teaching job

And they were concerned about the safety of their young daughter

What could they do

Run away

Seek asylum in another country

They didn't want to do that

They just wanted to live in their country safely

But their options were limited

So that month

Juan Carlos moved his family to a safer location

while he joined a group of migrants on the long and perilous journey

from Central America

to a job a family member said was open for him in the United States

By now we're all familiar with what awaited them

at the USMexico border

The harsher and harsher penalties doled out to those crossing there

The criminal prosecutions for crossing illegally

The inhumane detention

And most terribly separation of families

I'm here to tell you that not only is this treatment wrong

it's unnecessary

This belief that the only way to maintain order

is with inhumane means

is inaccurate

And in fact the opposite is true

Only a humane system will create order at the border

When safe orderly legal travel to the United States is available

very few people choose travel that is unsafe

disorderly or illegal

Now I appreciate the idea

that legal immigration could just resolve the border crisis

might sound a bit fanciful

But here is the good news

We have done this before

I've been working on immigration for years

at the Cato Institute

and other think tanks in Washington DC

and as the senior policy adviser for a republican member of Congress

negotiating bipartisan immigration reform

And I've seen firsthand

how America has implemented a system of humane order at the border

for Mexico

It's called a guest worker program

And here's the even better news

We can replicate this success for Central America

Of course some people

will still need to seek asylum at the border

But to understand how successful

this could be for immigrants like Juan Carlos

understand that until recently

nearly every immigrant arrested by Border Patrol was Mexican

In 

each Border Patrol agent arrested  Mexicans

Well over one per day

By  this number was just eight

That's one every  days

It is a  percent reduction

So where have all the Mexicans gone

The most significant change

is that the US began issuing

hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas to Mexicans

so that they can come legally

Jos Vsquez Cabrera was among the first Mexican guest workers
Jos  V  squez Cabrera
to take advantage of this visa expansion

He told The New York Times that before his visa

he'd made terrifying illegal border crossings

braving near deadly heat and the treachery of the landscape

One time a snake killed a member of his group

Thousands of other Mexicans also didn't make it

dying of dehydration in the deserts or drowning in the Rio Grande

Millions more were chased down and arrested

Guest worker visas have nearly ended this inhumane chaos

As Vsquez Cabrera put it
V  squez Cabrera
I no longer have to risk my life

to support my family

And when I'm here I don't have to live in hiding

Guest worker visas actually reduced the number of illegal crossings

more than the number of visas issued

Jose Bacilio another Mexican guest worker explained why
Jose Bacilio
to the Washington Post in April

He said even though he hadn't received a visa this year

he wouldn't risk all of his future chances

by crossing illegally

This likely helps explain why

from  to 

for every guest worker admitted legally from Mexico

there was a decline in two arrests of Mexicans crossing illegally

Now it's true

Mexican guest workers do some really tough jobs

Picking fruit cleaning crabs

landscaping in a degree heat

And some critics maintain that guest worker visas

are not actually humane

and that the workers are just abused slaves

But Vsquez Cabrera thought a guest worker visa was liberating
V  squez Cabrera
Not enslavement

And he like nearly all other guest workers

chose the legal path over the illegal one repeatedly

The expansion of guest worker visas to Mexicans

has been among the most significant humane changes

in US immigration policy ever

And that humane change

imposed order on chaos

So where does this leave Central Americans

like Juan Carlos

Well Central Americans received

just three percent of the guest worker visas issued in 

even as their share of border arrests has risen to  percent

The US issued just one guest worker visa to a Central American

for every  who crossed the border illegally in 

So if they can't get their papers at home

many take their chances

coming up through Mexico to claim asylum at the border

or cross illegally

even if like Juan Carlos they prefer to come to work

The US can do better

It needs to create new guest worker visas

specifically for Central Americans

This would create an incentive for US businesses

to seek out and hire Central Americans

paying for their flights to the United States

and diverting them from the illegal dangerous trek north

Central Americans could build flourishing lives at home

without the need to seek asylum at the border

or cross illegally

freeing up an overwhelmed system

Some people might say

that letting the workers go back and forth

will never work in Central America

where violence is so high

But again it worked in Mexico

even as Mexico's murder rate more than tripled over the last decade

to a level higher than much of Central America

And it would work for Juan Carlos

who said despite the threats

he only wants to live in the United States temporarily

to make enough money

to sustain his family in their new home

He even suggested that a guest worker program

would be one of the best things to help Hondurans like him

Cintia a yearold single mother of three from Honduras

seems to agree

She told the Wall Street Journal that she came for a job

to support her kids and her mom

Surveys of Central Americans traveling through Mexico

by the College of the Northern Border in Mexico

confirm that Juan and Cintia are the norm
JuanCintia
Most not all but most do come for jobs

even if like the Riveras

they may also face some real threats at home

How much would a lowwage job help

a Honduran like Juan or Cintia

Hondurans like them make as much

in one month in the United States

as they do in an entire year working in Honduras

A few years' work in the United States

can propel a Central American into its upper middle class

where safety is easier to come by

What Central Americans lack is not the desire to work

Not the desire to contribute to the US economy

to contribute to the lives of Americans

What Central Americans lack is a legal alternative to asylum

To be able to do so legally

Of course a new guest worker program

will not resolve  percent of this complex phenomenon

Many asylum seekers will still need to seek safety

at the US border

But with the flows reduced

we can more easily work out ways to deal with them humanely

But ultimately

no single policy has proven to do more

to create an immigration system that is both humane

and orderly

than to let the workers come legally

Thank you

You don't really look at a toothbrush and say

I'm great

But when you look at an Afro pick which is a grooming tool

it can remind you in your subconscious to like

really be proud and like All right

[Small thing]
[
[Big idea]
[]
An Afro pick is a utilitarian tool

used to maintain the Afro hairstyle

I think the Afro pick was designed

for the ergonomics of creating something

that felt like you were running fingers through your hair

The shape even the depth that it goes in  it's like a hand

You have plastic or nylon teeth

and then you have the stainless steel or the nickel teeth

I always prefer the metal tooth

just 'cause I like the sound

and the ones I know have the black power fist on the handle

When I think of black hair in America

I think of something that's been policed

Back in the days it was expected for black people

to chemically treat their hair

Whether that's healthy for them is a secondary thing to blending in

In the s dancer Ruth Beckford and a lot of jazz singers

were tired of straightening their hair

so they said all right we're going to just let it grow naturally

and started rocking natural closecropped hair

And in the s that style evolved

with the formation of the Afro

which was the cropped hair natural picked out

into a more spherical shape

You had civil rights leaders activists that adopted the hairstyle

as a means of rebellion and black pride

And then you had musicians like James Brown

who was infamously known for chemically straightening his hair

reject that and go natural

It went handinhand with his music

so he had songs like Say it Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud

The black is beautiful movement

is just rejecting the notion that to be black

or to have darker skin to have a curlier grade of hair

was something to be ashamed of

I have one of my favorite pictures of my mother

and my grandmother

and my grandmother had a small 'fro

and that was in the s

African hair combs date back to  BCE

The oldest African combs are found in ancient Egypt and Sudan

so they were making pyramids and combs

The way the ancient African combs were embellished

represented status or tribal affiliation

It's no coincidence that the fist on the modern Afro pick

also sets the tone for affiliation

and what set you claim

And then there's the Black Power movement

Most movements need their icons right

You have the fist you have the 'fro

These things coincide with the Black Panther aesthetic

where you could kind of spot your tribe from afar

because you're not just keeping a pick in like your beauty kit

It's in your back pocket

purposely with the first outside of it

and in your hair you'll rock it in your 'fro

If I think about iconic Afros

I definitely think about Angela Davis

Her 'fro personifies elegance style

freedom rebellion

You feel all of these feelings at once

when you see Angela Davis fighting for her life in federal court

By the s the Afro style became less radical

The Afro picks are still produced to this day

with the clenched fist

so it's the remnants of the movement

in the everyday object

When I was young it was just like another object

It was a comb

But as I became more enlightened

to really understand the roots and the origin

and the intentionality of the design

and why the fist and all of these things 

I woke up

Picture your dream vacation

Maybe you're dying to go to Rio for Carnival

Or you really just want to hang out on a Mexican beach

Or maybe you're going to join me in New Orleans for Jazz Fest

Now I know it's less pleasant

but picture for a moment

one of the most violent places on earth

Did anyone think of the same place

Brazil is the most violent country in the world today

More people have been dying there over the last three years

than in Syria

And in Mexico more people have died over the last  years

than in Iraq or Afghanistan

In New Orleans more people per capita are dying

than in wartorn Somalia

The fact is war only results

in about  percent of violent deaths worldwide

Today you are more likely to die violently

if you live in a middleincome democracy

with high levels of income inequality

and serious political polarization

The United States has four of the  most violent cities on earth

Now this is a fundamental alteration in the nature of violence historically

But it's also an opportunity

Because while few people can do much to end war

violence in our democracies is our problem

And while regular voters are a big part of that problem

we're also key to the solution

Now I work at a think tank

the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

where I advise governments on what to do about violence

but the dirty secret is

most policymakers haven't figured out these changes to violence today

They still believe that the worst violence happens in countries at war

or places that are too poor too weak

to fight violence and control crime

And that had been my assumption too

But if you look at a map of the most violent places on earth

you see something strange

Some of them are at war

and a few are truly failed states

The violence in these places is horrific

but they happen to have small populations

so it actually affects few people

Then there's South Africa Brazil Venezuela

These places are not poor

Maybe they're weak

My research assistant and I mapped places

based on how well they delivered on World Bank projects

and whether they could get public services to their people

and if you did well on both of those

if you could get sanitation and electricity to your people

and deliver vaccines

you were in the upper righthand quadrant

And then we overlaid that

with a map of places where journalists were being murdered

Some were happening in weak states

but an awful lot of journalists were being killed

in places plenty capable of protecting them

I traveled to every settled continent on earth

comparing places that had faced massive violence and recovered

and those that hadn't

and I kept seeing the same pattern

I came to call it privilege violence

because it happened in highly unequal democracies

where a small group of people

wanted to hold on to inordinate power and privilege

And if they didn't think they could get those policies past the voters

sometimes they would turn to violent groups for help

Drug cartels would finance their campaigns

Organized criminals would help them get out the vote

Gangs would suppress the vote

And in exchange they'd be given free reign

and violence would grow

Take Venezuela

It's the most violent country in the world today

if you look at deaths per capita

Twenty years ago the current regime gained power in legitimate elections

but they didn't want to risk losing it

and so they turned to gangs called colectivos for help
colectivos
The gangs were told to get out the vote for the government

and force people to vote for the regime in some neighborhoods

and keep opposition voters away from the polls in others

and in exchange they'd be given control

But if criminals have control

then police and courts can't do their jobs

So the second stage in privilege violence

is that courts and police are weakened

and politicians politicize budgets

hiring firing

so that they and the violent groups that they collude with stay out of jail

Now pretty soon good cops leave

and many that remain become brutal

They start off usually with rough justice

They kill a drug dealer that they think would be let off by the corrupt courts

But over time the worst of them realize that there will be no repercussions

from the politicians they're in bed with

and they go into business for themselves

In Venezuela nearly one in three murders is by the security services

Now the poor are hit hardest by violence all over the world

but they're hardly going to turn to such predatory cops for help

So they tend to form vigilante groups

But arm a bunch of yearold boys

and pretty soon they devolve into gangs over time

Other gangs come in mafias come in

and they offer to protect people from the other criminals

and from the police

Unlike the state

the criminals often try to buy legitimacy

They give charity They solve disputes
 
Sometimes they even build subsidized housing

The last stage of privilege violence happens when regular people

start committing a significant portion of the murder

Bar fights and neighborhood arguments turn deadly

when violence has become normal

and repercussions have evaporated

To outsiders the culture looks depraved

as if something is deeply wrong with those people

But any country can become this violent

when the government is by turns absent and predatory

Actually that's not quite true 

it takes one more step for this level of violence to reign

It takes mainstream society

to ignore the problem

You'd think that would be impossible

that violence at this level would be unbearable

but it's actually quite bearable to people like you and me

That's because in every society in the world

even the most violent

violence is highly concentrated

It happens to people on the wrong side of town

people who are poor often darker

often from groups that are marginalized

groups that mainstream society can separate ourselves from

Violence is so concentrated

that we're shocked when the pattern deviates

In Washington DC in 

a young white collegeeducated intern

went missing after a hike in Northwest DC

and her case was in the papers nearly every day

On the other side of town

a black man had been killed every other day that year

Most of those cases never made the papers even once

Middle class society buys their way out of violence

We live in better neighborhoods

Some people buy private security

And we also tell ourselves a story

We tell ourselves that most of the people who are killed

are probably involved in crime themselves

By believing that somehow some people deserve to be murdered

otherwise good people allow ourselves to live

in places where life chances are so deeply skewed

We allow ourselves

Because after all what else can you do

Well it turns out quite a lot

Because violence today is not largely the result of war

but is because of rotten politics in our democracies

regular voters are the greatest force for change

Consider the transformation of Bogot

In  Colombia's incoming president

was caught taking millions of dollars in campaign contributions

from the Cali drug cartel

and the capital was overrun with gangs and paramilitary groups

But fedup voters overcame really rabid partisanship

and they delivered nearly twothirds of the vote

to an independent candidate

enough to really overcome business as usual

On Mayor Mockus's first day in office

the police barely bothered to even brief him on homicide

and when he asked why they just shrugged and said

It's just criminals killing criminals

The corrupt city council

wanted to give police even more impunity for brutality

It's a really common tactic that's used worldwide

when politicians want to posture as tough on crime

but don't actually want to change the status quo

And research shows it backfires all over the world

If you throw a lot of lowlevel offenders into jails

usually already overcrowded jails

they learn from each other and they harden

They start to control the prisons and from there the streets

Instead Mockus insisted that police begin investigating every death

He fought the rightwing city council

and he abandoned SWATstyle police tactics
SWAT
And he fought the leftwing unions

and fired thousands of predatory cops

Honest police were finally free to do their jobs

Mockus then challenged citizens

He asked the middle class to stop opting out of their city

to follow traffic laws

and otherwise behave as if they shared the same community of fate

He asked the poor to uphold social norms against violence

often at immense personal risk

And he asked the wealthy to give  percent more in taxes voluntarily

Sixtythree thousand people did

And at the end of the decade that spanned Mayor Mockus's two terms in office

homicide in Bogot was down  percent

Audience Whoo

Applause

People in places with the most violence

whether it's Colombia or the United States

can make the biggest difference

The most important thing we can do is abandon the notion

that some lives are just worth less than others

that someone deserves to be raped or murdered

because after all they did something

they stole or they did something to land themselves in prison

where that kind of thing happens

This devaluing of human life

a devaluing we barely admit even to ourselves

is what allows the whole downward spiral to begin

It's what allows a bullet shot in a gang war in Rio

to lodge in the head of a twoyearold girl

climbing on a jungle gym nearby

And it's what allows a SWAT team hunting for a meth dealer in Georgia

to throw a flash bang grenade into the crib of a little boy

exploding near his face and maiming him for life

The fact is most violence everywhere

happens to people on the wrong side of town

at the wrong time

and some of those people are from communities

that we consider quite different

Some of them are people who have done horrible things

But reducing violence begins with privileging every human life

both because it's right

and because only by prizing each life as worthy of at least due process

can we create societies in which the lives of innocents are safe

Second recognize that today

inequality within our countries

is a vastly greater cause of violence than war between countries

Now inequality leads to violence for a whole host of reasons

but one of them is that it lets us separate ourselves

from what's happening on the other side of town

Those of us who are middleclass or wealthy

who are benefiting from these systems

have to change them at immense cost to ourselves

We have to pay enough taxes

and then demand that our governments put good teachers in other kids' schools

and welltrained police to protect other peoples' neighborhoods

But of course that's not going to do any good

if the government is stealing the money or fueling the violence

and so we also need better politicians with better incentives

The fact is we actually know a lot about what it takes to reduce violence

It's policies like putting more cops

in the few places where most violence occurs

But they don't fit easily into the boxes of the Left or the Right

and so you need really honest politicians

who are willing to buck kneejerk partisanship

and implement solutions

And if we want good politicians to run

we need to start respecting politicians

There's also a lot we can do to fight privilege violence in other countries

The most violent regimes tend to be fueled by drugs

and then they launder the profits through financial systems

in New York and London

through realestate transactions

and through highend resorts

If you use drugs

know your supply chain top to bottom

or admit the amount of pain you're willing to cause others

for your own pleasure

Meanwhile I would love to see one of those tourist sites

team up with investigative journalists

and create a little tiny icon 

right next to the one for free WiFi and if a place has a swimming pool
WiFi
there could be a little tiny gun

for likely criminal moneylaundering front

Laughter

Applause

But until then

if you're booking a place in a dangerous country

whether that's Jamaica or New Orleans

do a little web research

see if you can see any criminal ties

And to make that easier

support legislation

that makes our financial systems more transparent 

things like banning anonymous company ownership

Now this all probably sounds pretty quixotic

kind of like recycling your cans

just a tiny drop in the ocean of a gigantic problem

but that's actually a misconception

Homicide has been falling for centuries

Battle deaths have been dropping for decades

In places where people have demanded change

violent death has fallen from Colombia to New York City

where homicide is down  percent since 

The fact is violence will always be with us

but it's not a constant

It has been falling for centuries and it could fall further faster

Could it drop by  percent in the next quarter century a third

Many of us actually think it could

I think of all the kids who'd grow up with their dads

all the families that get their sisters back

their brothers

All it needs is one small push

It needs us to care

Thank you

Applause

When I was a teen I had terrible periods

I had crippling cramps

I leaked blood onto my clothes and onto my bed sheets

and I had period diarrhea

And I had to miss school one to two days a month

and I remember sitting on the couch with my heating pads thinking

What's up with this

When I ate food I didn't leak saliva from my salivary glands

When I went for a walk

I didn't leak fluid from my knees joint fluid

Why was menstruation so different

I wanted answers to these questions

but there was no one for me to ask

My mother knew nothing about menstruation

except that it was dirty and shameful and I shouldn't talk about it

I asked girlfriends

and everybody spoke in euphemisms

And finally when I got the courage to go to the doctor

and talk about my heavy periods

I was told to eat liver

Laughter

And when I went to the drug store to buy my menstrual products

my pack of super maxi pads

back in the day when they were the size of a tissue box each pad 

Laughter

You know what I'm talking about

You have no idea how far absorbent technology has come

Laughter

I used to have to buy my menstrual products

in the feminine hygiene aisle

And I remember standing there thinking

Well why don't I buy toilet paper in the anal hygiene aisle

Laughter

Like what's up with that

Why can't we talk about periods

And it's not about the blood as Freud would have you say

because if it were

there would be an ear nose and throat surgeon up here right now

talking about the taboos of nose bleeds right

And it's not even about periods

because otherwise when we got rid of our toxic shameful periods

when we became menopausal

we'd be elevated to a higher social status

Laughter

Applause

It's just a patriarchal society is invested in oppressing women

and at different points in our lives different things are used

And menstruation is used

during what we in medicine call the reproductive years

It's been around since pretty much the beginning of time

many cultures thought that women could spoil crops

or milk or wilt flowers

And then when religion came along

purity myths only made that worse

And medicine wasn't any help

In the s and 's

there was the idea that women elaborated something called a menotoxin

We could wilt flowers just by walking by

Laughter

And that's what happens when there's no diversity right

Because there was no woman to put her hand up and go

Well actually that doesn't happen

And when you can't talk about what's happening to your body

how do you break these myths

Because you don't even need to be a doctor

to say that periods aren't toxic

If they were why would an embryo implant in a toxic swill

And if we all had this secret menotoxin

we could be laying waste to crops and spoiling milk

Laughter

Why would we have not used our XWomen powers to get the vote sooner
XWomen
Laughter

Applause

Even now

when I tweet about period diarrhea

as one does

Laughter

I mention that it affects  percent of women

And every single time someone approaches me and says

I thought I was the only one

That's how effective that culture of shame is

that women can't even share their experiences

So I began to think

Well what if everybody knew about periods like a gynecologist

Wouldn't that be great

Then you would all know what I know

you'd know that menstruation

is a pretty unique phenomenon among mammals

Most mammals have estrus

Humans some primates

some bats

the elephant shrew and the spiny mouse menstruate

And with menstruation what happens is the brain triggers the ovary

to start producing an egg

Estrogen is released

and it starts to build up the lining of the uterus

cell upon cell like bricks

And what happens if you build a brick wall too high without mortar

Well it's unstable

So what happens when you ovulate

You release a hormone called progesterone

which is progestational it gets the uterus ready

It acts like a mortar and it holds those bricks together

It also causes some changes

to make the lining more hospitable for implantation

If there's no pregnancy

Whoosh

lining comes out

there's bleeding from the blood vessels and that's the period

And I always find this point really interesting

Because with estrus

the final signaling to get the lining of the uterus ready

actually comes from the embryo

But with menstruation

that choice comes from the ovary

It's as if choice is coded in to our reproductive tracts

Cheering and applause

OK so now we know why the blood is there

And it's a pretty significant amount

It's  to  milliliters of blood

which is one to three ounces

and it can be more

and I know it seems like it's more a lot of the times

I know

So why do we have so much blood

And why doesn't it just stay there till the next cycle right

Like you didn't get pregnant so why can't it hang around

Well imagine if each month it got thicker and thicker and thicker right

like imagine what tsunami period that would be

Laughter

We can't reabsorb it because it's too much

And it's too much because we need a thick uterine lining

for a very specific reason

Pregnancy exerts a significant biological toll on our bodies

There is maternal mortality

there is the toll of breastfeeding

and there is the toll of raising a child until it is independent

And evolution 

Laughter

That goes on longer for some of us than others

Laughter

But evolution knows about riskbenefit ratio

And so evolution wants to maximize the chance of a beneficial outcome

And how do you maximize the chance of a beneficial outcome

You try to get the highest quality embryos

And how do you get the highest quality embryos

You make them work for it

You give them an obstacle course

So over the millennia that we have evolved

it's been a little bit like an arms race in the uterus

the lining getting thicker and thicker and thicker

and the embryo getting more invasive

until we reach this dtente

with the lining of the uterus that we have

So we have this thick uterine lining

and now it's got to come out

and how do you stop bleeding

Well you stop a nose bleed by pinching it

if you cut your leg you put pressure on it

We stop bleeding with pressure

When we menstruate

the lining of the uterus releases substances

that are made into chemicals called prostaglandins

and other inflammatory mediators

And they make the uterus cramp down

they make it squeeze on those blood vessels

to stop the bleeding

They might also change blood flow to the uterus

and also cause inflammation and that makes pain worse

And so you say OK how much pressure is generated

And from studies where some incredible women

have volunteered to have pressure catheters

put in their uterus

that they wear their whole menstrual cycle 

God bless them because we wouldn't have this knowledge without

and it's very important knowledge

because the pressure that's generated in the uterus

during menstruation

is  millimeters of mercury

Well what's that you say

Well it's the amount of pressure that's generated

during the second stage of labor when you're pushing

Audience gasps

Right

Which for those of you who haven't had an unmedicated delivery

that's what it's like when the blood pressure cuff

is not quite as tight as it was at the beginning

but it's still pretty tight

and you wish it would stop

So that kind of makes it different right

If you start thinking about the pain of menstruation

we wouldn't say if someone needed to miss school

because they were in the second stage of labor and pushing

we wouldn't call them weak

We'd be like Oh my God you made it that far right

Laughter

And we wouldn't deny pain control

to women who have typical pain of labor right

So it's important for us to call this pain typical instead of normal

because when we say it's normal it's easier to dismiss

As opposed to saying it's typical and we should address it

And we do have some ways to address menstrual pain

One way is with something called a TENS unit
TENS
which you can wear under your clothes

and it sends an electrical impulse to the nerves and muscles

and no one really knows how it works

but we think it might be the gate theory of pain

which is counterirritation

It's the same reason why if you hurt yourself you rub it

Vibration travels faster to your brain than pain does

We also have medications

called nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications

And what they do is they block the release of prostaglandins

They can reduce menstrual pain for  percent of women

They also reduce the volume of blood by  to  percent

and they can help with period diarrhea

And we also have hormonal contraception

which gives us a thinner lining of the uterus

so there's less prostaglandins produced

and with less blood there's less need for cramping

Now if those treatments fail you 

and it's important to use that word choice

because we never fail the treatment

the treatment fails us

If that treatment fails you

you could be amongst the people

who have a resistance to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories

We don't quite understand

but there are some complex mechanisms

why those medications just don't work for some women

It's also possible that you could have

another reason for painful periods

You could have a condition called endometriosis

where the lining of the uterus is growing in the pelvic cavity

causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhesions

And there may be other mechanisms we don't quite understand yet

because it's a possibility that pain thresholds could be different

due to very complex biological mechanisms

But we're only going to find that out by talking about it

It shouldn't be an act of feminism

to know how your body works

It shouldn't 

Applause

It shouldn't be an act of feminism

to ask for help when you're suffering

The era of menstrual taboos is over

Cheers and applause

The only curse here

is the ability to convince half the population

that the very biological machinery that perpetuates the species

that gives everything that we have

is somehow dirty or toxic

And I'm not going to stand for it

Applause

And the way we break that curse

It's knowledge

Thank you

Cheers and applause

For my husband it was love at first sight

Here's what happened

Years ago Rudy

who I had strictly put in the friend zone at the time

came over to my house and met my dad

a pharmaceutical scientist who had just retired

after bringing a drug to market

My dad said

Ah you probably wouldn't have heard of it

It's for IPF
IPF
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

Rudy paused for a long time and then he said

That's the disease that took my father's life  years ago

Rudy says that this is the moment he fell in love

Laughter

With my father

Laughter

Even though it was too late for my dad to save his

he felt that destiny had delivered us this fullcircle moment

In my family we have a special love for my father's inventions

And in particular we have a reverence for his patents

We have framed patents on the wall in our house

And there's a recognition in our family that everything I've been able to do 

college law school health justice work 

all of it is because America enabled my father

to fulfill his potential as an inventor

Applause

Last year I met the director of the US Patent Office

for the first time

and I sent my family a selfie from that office in Virginia

Laughter

I got so many emojis back

you would have thought I had met Beyonc

Laughter

But truth be told

I was actually there to talk about a problem 

how our outdated patent system is fueling the high cost of medicines

and costing lives

Today over two billion people live without access to medicines

And against this global crisis

drug prices are skyrocketing

including in wealthier countries

Thirtyfour million Americans have lost a family member or a friend

in the last five years

not because the treatment didn't exist

but because they couldn't afford it

Rising drug costs are pushing families into homelessness

seniors into bankruptcy

and parents to crowdfunding treatment for their critically ill children

There are many reasons for this crisis

but one is the outdated patent system

that America tries to export to the rest of the world

The original intention behind the patent system

was to motivate people to invent

by rewarding them with a timelimited monopoly

But today that intention has been distorted beyond recognition

Corporations have teams of lawyers and lobbyists

whose sole job is to extend patent protection as long as possible

And they've kept the patent office busy

It took  years for the US Patent Office

to issue its first five million patents

It took just  years for it to issue the next five million

We haven't gotten drastically more inventive

Corporations have gotten drastically better at gaming the system

Drug patents have exploded 

between  and  they doubled

But consider this

The vast majority of medicines associated with new drug patents

are not new

Nearly eight out of  are for existing ones

like insulin or aspirin

My organization a team of lawyers and scientists

recently conducted an investigation into the  bestselling drugs in America

We found that on average

there are  patents filed on each medicine

Often for things we've known how to do for decades

like putting two pills into one

The higher a patent wall a company builds

the longer they hold on to their monopoly

And with no one to compete with

they can set prices at whim

And because these are medicines

and not designer watches

we have no choice but to pay

The patent wall is a strategy to block competition

Not for the  years maximum

that America's founders originally envisioned

or the  years allowed by law today

but for  years or more

Meanwhile prices on these drugs have continued to increase 

 percent since 

That's seven times the rate of inflation

And people are struggling or even dying

because they can't afford the meds

Now I want to be really clear about something

This isn't about making the pharmaceutical industry the bad guy

What I'm talking about today

is whether the system we created to promote progress

is actually working as intended

Sure the pharmaceutical companies are gaming the system

but they're gaming it because they can

Because we have failed to adapt this system

to meet today's realities

The government is handing out

one of the most prized rewards in business 

the opportunity to create a product that is protected from competition 

and asking for less and less in return on our behalf

Imagine awarding  Pulitzer Prizes to one author for the same book

Murmurs
murmurs
It doesn't have to be this way

We can create a modern patent system

to meet the needs of a stcentury society

And to do that

we need to reimagine the patent system to serve the public

not just corporations

So how do we do it

Five reforms

First we need to stop handing out so many patents

Back under the Kennedy administration

in an effort to curb rising drug costs

a congressman from Tennessee proposed an idea

He said

If you want to tweak a drug

and you want to get another patent on it

the modified version has to be significantly better therapeutically

for patients

Because of intense lobbying

this idea never saw the light of day

But a reimagined patent system

would resurrect and evolve this simple yet elegant proposition

That to get a patent

you have to invent something substantially better

than what's already out there

This shouldn't be controversial

As a society

we reserve the big rewards for the big ideas

We don't give Michelin stars to chefs who just tweak a recipe 

we give them to chefs who change how we think about food

And yet we hand out patents worth billions of dollars

for minor changes

It's time to raise the bar

Second

we need to change the financial incentives of the Patent Office

Right now the revenue of the Patent Office

is directly linked to the number of patents that it grants

That's like private prisons getting paid more to hold more people 

it naturally leads to more incarceration

not less

The same is true for patents

Third we need more public participation

Right now the patent system is like a black box

It's a twoway conversation between the patent office and industry

You and I aren't invited to that party

But imagine if instead

the Patent Office became a dynamic center for citizen learning and ingenuity

staffed not just by technical experts and bureaucrats

but also by great publichealth storytellers

with a passion for science

Regular citizens could get accessible information

about complex technologies

like artificial intelligence or gene editing

enabling us to participate in the policy conversations

that directly impact our health and lives

Fourth

we need to get the right to go to court

Right now in America after a patent is granted

the public has no legal standing

Only those with a commercial interest usually other drug companies

have that right

But I've witnessed firsthand how lives can be saved

when everyday citizens have the right to go to court

Back in  in India

my organization worked with patient advocates

to challenge legally unjust HIV drug patents

at a time when so many people were dying

because medicines were priced out of reach

We were able to bring down the prices of medicines

by up to  percent

Applause

On just three drugs

we were able to save health systems half a billion dollars

Now cases like these can save millions of lives

and billions of dollars

Imagine if Americans had the right to go to court too

And lastly we need stronger oversight

We need an independent unit that can serve as a public advocate

regularly monitoring the activities of the Patent Office

and reporting to Congress

If a unit like this had existed

it would have caught for example the Silicon Valley company Theranos
Theranos
before it got so many patents for blood testing

and landed an evaluation of nine billion dollars

when in reality

there was no invention there at all

This kind of accountability is going to become increasingly urgent

In the age of andMe

important questions are being asked

about whether companies can patent and sell

our genetic information and our patient data

We need to be part of those conversations

before it's too late

Our information is being used to create the new therapies

And when that moment of diagnosis comes for me and my family

or for you and yours

are we going to have to crowdfund to save the lives of those we love

That's not the world I want to live in

It's not the world I want for my twoyearold son

My dad is growing older now

and he is still as quietly brilliant and morally directed as ever

Sometimes people ask us whether things get heated between us

the patentholding scientist

and his patentreforming lawyer daughter

It's such a profound misunderstanding of what's at stake

because this is not about scientists versus activists

or invention versus protection

This is about people

our quest to invent and our right to live

My dad and I understand that our ingenuity and our dignity

go hand in hand

We are on the same side

It is time to reimagine a patent system

that reflects that knowing

Thank you

So if you live on planet Earth

and you're one of seven billion people that eats food every day

I need you to pay attention

because over the next three decades

we will need to address

one of the most critical global challenges of our generation

And I'm not talking about climate change

I'm talking about food and agriculture

In  our global population is projected to reach  billion

with  percent of us living in urban city centers

In order to feed this massive population

we will need to increase our agricultural output

by  percent over current levels

Just to put this number into perspective

we will need to grow more food in the next  to  years

than the previous  years combined

Put simply not only is our global population becoming bigger

but it's also getting denser

and we will need to grow significantly more food

using significantly less land and resources

Complicating our current efforts to address these major demographic shifts

are the challenges facing the agricultural industry today

Globally one third of all the food that we produce is wasted

acquitting to  billion tons of food

that spoiled on the way to the market

or expired in our refrigerators

or were simply thrown out by supermarkets and restaurants

at the end of the day

Every single year up to  million people

will get sick eating contaminated food

highlighting the challenge that we have of maintaining global food safety

And maybe unsurprisingly

the agricultural industry

is the single largest consumer of fresh water

accounting for  percent of global usage

Now you'll be relieved to know

that the agricultural industry

and that the global movement by universities companies and NGOs

is putting together comprehensive research

and developing novel technology

to address all of these issues

And many have been doing it for decades

But one of the more recent innovations in food production

being deployed in industrial parks in North America

in the urban city centers of Asia

and even in the arid deserts of the Middle East

is controlled environment agriculture

Controlled environment agriculture is actually just a fancy way of saying

weather or climateproof farming

and many of these farms grow food threedimensionally in vertical racks

as opposed to the two dimensions of conventional farms

And so this type of food production is also referred to

as indoor vertical farming

I've been involved in the indoor vertical farming space

for the past five and a half years

developing technology to make this type of food production

more efficient and affordable

This picture was taken outside of a decommissioned shipping container

that we converted into an indoor farm

and then launched into the heart and the heat of Dubai

Indoor vertical farming is a relatively recent phenomena

commercially speaking

and the reason for this is that consumers care more about food safety

and where their food comes from

and also the necessary technology to make this possible

is more readily available and lower cost

and the overall cost of food production globally is actually increasing

making this type of food production more competitive

So if you want to build an indoor vertical farm

you will need to replace some of the conventional elements of farming

with artificial substitutes

starting with sunlight

In indoor vertical farms

natural sunlight is replaced with artificial lighting like LEDs
LED
While there are many different types of LEDs being used
LED
the one that we decided to install here

is called full spectrum LEDs
LED
which was optimized for the type of vegetables that we were growing

Also in order to maximize production for a given space

indoor vertical farms also utilize and install racking systems

to grow vegetables vertically

and some of the biggest facilities

stack their production  to  floors high

Now most of these farms are hydroponic or aeroponic systems

which means that instead of using soil

they use a substitute material like polyurethane sponges

biodegradable peat moss

and even use inorganic materials like perlite and clay pellets

Another unique aspects about these farms

is that they use a precise nutrient formula

that is circulated and recycled throughout the facility

and this is pumped directly to the vegetables' root zone

to promote plant growth

And lastly these farms use

a sophisticated monitoring and automation system

to significantly increase productivity

efficiency and consistency

and these tools also provide the added benefit

of producing food that is more traceable and safe

Some of the obvious benefits of growing food in this way

is that you have yearround vegetable production

you have consistent quality and you have predictable output

Some of the other major benefits

include significant resource use efficiencies

particularly water

For every kilogram of vegetables grown in this way

hundreds of liters of water is conserved compared to conventional farming methods

And with the water savings

come similar savings in the use of fertilizer

One of the highestyielding farms

grows over  times more food per square meter than a conventional farm

And weatherproofing

means complete control of incoming contaminants and pests

completely eliminating the need for the use of chemical pesticides

And not to be mistaken

these farms can produce enormous amounts of food

with one of the biggest facilities

producing  heads of vegetables a day

However as with any new technology or innovation

there are some drawbacks

As you would imagine

growing food in this way can be incredibly energyintensive

Also these farms can only produce a small variety of vegetables commercially

and the overall cost of the production still is quite high

And in order to address these issues

some of the biggest and most sophisticated farms

are making significant investments starting with energy efficiency

In order to reduce the high energy usage

there are efforts to develop higherefficiency LEDs
LED
to develop lasers optimized for plant growth

and using even fiberoptic cables like these

to channel sunlight directly into an indoor vertical farm

during the day to reduce the need for artificial lighting

Also to reduce the labor costs associated with hiring a more sophisticated

more urban and also more highskilled labor force

robotics in automation is used extensively in largescale facilities

And you can never really be too resourceefficient

Building indoor vertical farms in and around urban city centers

can help to shorten the agricultural supply chain

and also help to maintain the nutritional content in vegetables

Also there are food deserts in many countries

that have little to no access to nutritious vegetables

and as this industry matures

it will become possible to provide more equitable access

to highquality highly nutritious vegetables

in even the most underprivileged of communities

And finally and this is really exciting for me personally

indoor vertical farming can actually be integrated seamlessly

into the cityscape

to help repurpose idle underutilized and unused urban infrastructure

In fact this is already happening today

Ridesharing services have taken hundreds of thousands of cars off the road

and they have significantly reduced the need for parking

This is a farm that we installed in central Beijing

in an underutilized underground parking structure

to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels

Underutilized infrastructure

is not simply limited to largescale civil engineering projects

and they can also include smaller spaces like idle restaurant corners

This is an example of a farm that we installed

directly into the partition of a hotel entrance

in order to grow fresh herbs and microgreens onsite for the chefs

Honestly if you look around

you will find underutilized space everywhere

under around and inside of urban developments

This is a farm that we installed into an empty office corner

to grow fresh vegetables for the employees in nearby cafes

I get to be a part of all these cool projects

and working in the agricultural industry

to improve access and affordability

to fresh and nutritious produce

hopefully soon by anyone anywhere

has been the greatest joy and also the most humbling

and intellectually challenging thing I've ever done

And now that I've convinced you that agriculture can be quite sexy

you'll be surprised and shocked to know

that I still have trouble

fully articulating how and why I decided to work and continue to work

in the agricultural industry

But a couple of years ago I found a rather unique answer

hiding in plain sight

You see I read an article

about how your name

particularly your last name

can have a strong influence

on everything from your personality to your professional career

This is my Japanese last name

Oda

And the characters translate literally

into small farm

Laughter

Thank you

You're probably familiar with FOMO
FOMO
[This guy invented the term]
[]
That's short for Fear Of Missing Out

It's that feeling you get

when it seems everyone else is doing something better

than what you're doing now

But there's another FO you need to know about
FO
and it's far more dangerous

It's called FOBO
FOBO
and it's short for Fear Of a Better Option

[The Way We Work]
[]
We live in a world of overwhelming choice

Even decisions that used to be simple

like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases

are now fraught with overanalysis

Technology has only made the issue more pronounced

If you want to buy a pair of white shoelaces online

you have to sort through thousands of items

and read through hundreds of reviews

That's an astounding amount of information to process

to just buy two pieces of string that cost less than your morning latte

Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you've struggled
FOBO
to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes

It's a symptom of a culture which sees value

in collecting and preserving as many options as possible

You might wonder why all of this is so bad

It seems counterintuitive

Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options

to choose from

The problem is FOBO induces such severe analysis paralysis
FOBO
that it can negatively impact both your personal and professional life

When you can't make decisions with conviction

you waste precious time and energy

Luckily there is a way to overcome FOBO
FOBO
Here's a secret

With any decision you make you first have to determine the stakes

as this will inform your decisionmaking strategy

When it comes down to it

you only really face three types of decisions in life

high stakes low stakes and no stakes

Let's start with nostakes decisions

These are the minor details of life

where there is almost never an incorrect answer

and in a few hours you won't even remember

making the decision

A good example of this is choosing what to watch on TV

With thousands of shows it's easy to get overwhelmed

yet no matter what you pick

the consequences are basically nonexistent

So spending more than a few moments on FOBO
FOBO
is a massive waste of energy

You just need to move on

When it comes to nostakes decisions

the key is to outsource them to the universe

For example you can whittle down your choices to just two

and then flip a coin

Or try my personal favorite  ask the watch

Assign each one of your choices to one half of your watch

then let the second hand tell you what you're going to do

Looks like I'll be having the fish

That brings us to lowstakes decisions

These have consequences but none are earthshattering

and there are plenty of acceptable outcomes

Many routine things at work like purchasing a printer

booking a hotel or choosing between possible venues for an offsite

are classically lowstakes in nature

Some thinking is required

but these aren't makeorbreak deliberations

and you'll probably forget about them in a few weeks

Here you can also outsource decisionmaking

but you want some critical thinking involved

as there are some stakes

This time you'll outsource to a person

Set some basic criteria

select someone to present a recommendation

and then take their advice

Make sure to avoid the temptation to canvass

Your goal is to clear your plate

not to kick the can down the road

Now that you tackled lowstakes and nostakes decisions

you've created the space and time you'll need

to handle highstakes decisions

These are things like which house should I buy

or which job should I accept

Since the stakes are high and there are longterm implications

you absolutely want to get it right

Before we get to work let's establish a few basic principles

to guide you through the process

First think about what really matters to you

and set your criteria accordingly

Second gather the relevant facts

Make sure you collect data about all of the options

so you can be confident

that you're truly making an informed decision

And third remember that FOBO by nature
FOBO
comes when you struggle to choose just one

from a group of perfectly acceptable options

So no matter what you choose

you can rest assured that the downside is limited

Now that you've established some ground rules

the process can begin

Start by identifying a frontrunner based on your intuition

then compare each of your options headtohead

with the frontrunner onebyone

Each time choose the better of the two based on the criteria

and discard the other one

Here's the trick to avoiding FOBO
FOBO
When you eliminate an option it's gone forever

If you keep returning to discarded options

you risk getting stuck

Now repeat this process until you get down to one final choice

If you follow this system

you will usually end up with a decision on your own

On the rare occasion that you get stuck

you will outsource the final decision

to a small group of qualified people who you trust

and who are equipped to provide you with guidance

on this particular topic

Engage a group of five or less ideally an odd number of people

so that you have a builtin tiebreaker if you need it

Now that you've made your choice one last challenge remains

You have to commit

I can't promise you that you'll ever truly know if you've made the perfect decision

but I can tell you this

a significant percentage of people in the world

will never have to worry about FOBO
FOBO
Unlike the billions of people who have few options if any

due to war poverty or illness

you have plentiful opportunities to live decisively

You may not get everything you want

but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful

In fact it's a gift

Make the most of it

A few years ago my obsession with productivity

got so bad that I suffered an episode of burnout

that scared the hell out of me

I'm talking insomnia weight gain hair loss  the works

I was so overworked that my brain

literally couldn't come up with another idea

That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity

[The Way We Work]
[]
Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day

Do you spend hours reading productivity hacks

trying new frameworks and testing new apps

to get even more done

I've tried them all  task apps calendar apps

timemanagement apps

things that are meant to manage your day

We've been so obsessed with doing more

that we've missed the most important thing

Many of these tools aren't helping

They're making things worse

OK let's talk about productivity for a second

Historically productivity as we know it today

was used during the industrial revolution

It was a system that measured performance based on consistent output

You clocked into your shift

and were responsible for creating X number of widgets
X
on the assembly line

At the end of the day it was pretty easy to see

who worked hard and who hadn't

When we shifted to a knowledge economy

people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract

things like writing problemsolving or strategizing

tasks that weren't easy to measure

Companies struggled to figure out

how to tell who was working and who wasn't

so they just adopted the old systems as best as they could

leading to things like the dreaded time sheet

where everyone is under pressure

to justify how they spend every second of their day

There's just one problem

These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work

We still think of productivity as an endurance sport

You try to churn out as many blog posts

or we cram our day full of meetings

But this model of constant output isn't conducive to creative thought

Today knowledge workers are facing a big challenge

We're expected to be constantly productive and creative

in equal measure

But it's actually almost impossible

for our brains to continuously generate new ideas

with no rest

In fact downtime is a necessity for our brain

to recover and to operate properly

Consider that according to a team of researchers

from the University of Southern California

letting our minds wander is an essential mental state

that helps us develop our identity

process social interactions

and it even influences our internal moral compass

Our need for a break flies in the face of our cultural narrative about hustling

in other words the stories that we as a society

tell each other about what success looks like

and what it takes to get there

Stories like the American Dream

which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs

This tells us that if we work hard we'll be successful

But there's a flip side

If you aren't successful

it must mean that you're not working hard enough

And if you don't think you're doing enough

of course you're going to stay late pull allnighters

and push yourself hard even when you know better

Productivity has wrapped itself up in our selfworth

so that it's almost impossible for us to allow ourselves

to stop working

The average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave

further proving that even if we have the option

to take a break we don't

To be clear I don't think that productivity

or trying to improve our performance is bad

I'm just saying that the current models we're using to measure our creative work

don't make sense

We need systems that work with our creativity

and not against it

[SO HOW DO WE FIX IT]
[]
There is no quick fix for this problem

And I know I know that sucks

No one loves a good framework or a good acronym

better than me

But the truth is everyone has their own narratives

that they have to uncover

It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around work

that I began to unravel the root of my own work story

finally being able to let go of destructive behaviors

and make positive longlasting changes

And the only way to do that

is by asking yourself some hard questions

Does being busy make you feel valuable

Who do you hold up as an example of success

Where did your ideas of work ethic come from

How much of who you are is linked to what you do

Your creativity it has its own rhythms

Our energy fluctuates daily weekly even seasonally

I know that I'm always more energetic at the beginning of the week

than at the end

so I frontload my workweek to account for that fact

As a proud night owl I free up my afternoons and evenings

for creative work

And I know I'll get more writing done

in the cozy winter months than during the summer

And that's the secret

Dismantling myths challenging your old views

identifying your narratives 

this is the real work that we need to be doing

We aren't machines

and I think it's time that we stopped working like one

No matter how hard you might try

you can't just flip a switch when you step into the office

and turn your emotions off

Feeling feelings is part of being human

[The Way We Work]
[]
A pervasive myth exists that emotions don't belong at work

and this often leads us

to mistakenly equate professionalism with being stoic or even cold

But research shows that in the moments when our colleagues

drop their glossy professional presentation

we're actually much more likely to believe what they're telling us

We feel connected to the people around us

We try harder we perform better

and we're just generally kinder

So it's about time that we learn how to embrace emotion at work

Now that's not to say

you should suddenly become a feelings fire hose

A line exists between sharing which builds trust

and oversharing which destroys it

If you suddenly let your feelings run wild at work

and give people far more information than they bargained for

you make everyone around you uncomfortable

and you also undermine yourself

You're more likely to be seen as weak or lacking self awareness

so great to say you weren't feeling well last night 

you don't need to go into every lurid detail

about how you got reacquainted with your halfdigested dinner

So there's a wide spectrum of emotional expression

On one hand you have underemoters

or people who have a hard time talking about their feelings

and on the other end are overemoters

those who constantly share everything that's going on inside

and neither of these make for a healthy workplace

So what's the balance between these two extremes

It's something called selective vulnerability

Selective vulnerability is opening up

while still prioritizing stability and psychological safety

both for you and for your colleagues

Luckily anyone can learn

to be selectively vulnerable with practice

Here are four ways to get started

First flag your feelings without becoming emotionally leaky

Bad moods are contagious

and even if you're not vocalizing what you're feeling

chances are your body language or your expressions

are a dead giveaway

So if you are crossing your arms or hammering on your keyboard

your coworkers are going to know you're upset

And if you don't say anything

they might start to think it's about them and get worried

So if you are reacting to a nonworkrelated event

so traffic for example just flag it

You don't need to go into detail

You can say something as simple as I'm having a bad morning

It has nothing to do with you

Now if it's a workrelated event

that's causing you to feel strong emotions

that brings us to point number two

Try to understand the need behind your emotion

and then address that need

If you suddenly start to find everyone around you irritating

sit back and reflect on that

And it might be that you're irritable because you're anxious

and you're anxious because you're worried about hitting a looming deadline

And in that case you can go back to your team

to address that need and say something like

I want to make sure I get everything done ahead of the deadline

Can you help me put together a realistic plan to do that

If you're thinking of sharing

try and put yourself in the other person's shoes

So if what you're about to say would help you feel more supported

and better understand the situation

then go ahead and share it

But if it gives you any kind of pause you might want to leave it out

And finally read the room and provide a path forward

If everyone on your team has been pulling long hours

and you notice that one of your colleagues seems particularly deflated or anxious

you can acknowledge that and show some empathy

but then try to give them something actionable

that they could hold on to

And in this case

you could suggest that you go to your manager

and ask that your weekly meeting

be pushed back a day so you both have more time to work

You're showing you're invested in their success

but also that you care about their wellbeing

When we can be honest about what we feel

and freely suggest ideas make mistakes

and just not have to hide every piece of who we are

we're much more likely to stay at the company for a long time

We're also happier and more productive

So take a moment to reflect on the emotional expression

that you bring to work each day

And if you are prone to oversharing try editing

And if you're a little bit more reserved

look for moments when you can open up to your colleagues

and be a bit vulnerable

And chances are there will be a big difference

in how people respond to you

And selective vulnerability might just become

one of your most valuable tools

If you look at a carpenter they have a toolbox

a dentist they have their drills

In our era and the type of work most of us are doing

the tool we most need is actually centered

around being able to give and receive feedback well

[The Way We Work]
[]
Humans have been talking about feedback for centuries

In fact Confucius way back in  BC

talked about how important it is to be able to say difficult messages well

But to be honest we're still pretty bad at it

In fact a recent Gallup survey found

that only  percent of employees strongly agree

that the feedback they get actually improves their work

Those numbers are pretty dismal

So what's going on

The way that most people give their feedback

actually isn't brainfriendly

People fall into one of two camps

Either they're of the camp that is very indirect and soft

and the brain doesn't even recognize that feedback is being given

or it's just simply confused

or they fall into the other camp of being too direct

and with that it tips the other person into the land of being defensive

There's this part of the brain called the amygdala

and it's scanning at all times to figure out

whether the message has a social threat attached to it

With that we'll move forward to defensiveness

we'll move backwards in retreat

and what happens is the feedback giver then starts to disregulate as well

They add more ums and uhs and justifications
umsuhs
and the whole thing gets wonky really fast

It doesn't have to be this way

I and my team have spent many years going into different companies

and asking who here is a great feedback giver

Anybody who's named again and again

we actually bring into our labs to see what they're doing differently

And what we find is that there's a fourpart formula

that you can use to say any difficult message well

OK are you ready for it Here we go
 
The first part of the formula is what we call the microyes

Great feedback givers begin their feedback

by asking a question that is short but important

It lets the brain know that feedback is actually coming

It would be something for example like

Do you have five minutes to talk about how that last conversation went

or I have some ideas for how we can improve things

Can I share them with you

This microyes question does two things for you

First of all it's going to be a pacing tool

It lets the other person know that feedback is about to be given

And the second thing it does is it creates a moment of buyin

I can say yes or no to that yes or no question

And with that I get a feeling of autonomy

The second part of the feedback formula is going to be giving your data point

Here you should name specifically what you saw or heard

and cut out any words that aren't objective

There's a concept we call blur words

A blur word is something that can mean different things to different people

Blur words are not specific

So for example if I say You shouldn't be so defensive

or You could be more proactive

What we see great feedback givers doing differently

is they'll convert their blur words into actual data points

So for example instead of saying

You aren't reliable

we would say You said you'd get that email to me by 

and I still don't have it yet

Specificity is also important when it comes to positive feedback

and the reason for that is that we want to be able to specify exactly

what we want the other person to increase or diminish

And if we stick with blur words

they actually won't have any clue particularly

what to do going forward to keep repeating that behavior

The third part of the feedback formula is the impact statement

Here you name exactly how that data point impacted you

So for example I might say Because I didn't get the message

I was blocked on my work and couldn't move forward

or I really liked how you added those stories

because it helped me grasp the concepts faster

It gives you a sense of purpose

and meaning and logic between the points

which is something the brain really craves

The fourth part of the feedback formula is a question

Great feedback givers wrap their feedback message with a question

They'll ask something like

Well how do you see it

Or This is what I'm thinking we should do

but what are your thoughts on it

What it does is it creates commitment rather than just compliance

It makes the conversation no longer be a monologue

but rather becomes a joint problemsolving situation

But there's one last thing

Great feedback givers not only can say messages well

but also they ask for feedback regularly

In fact our research on perceived leadership

shows that you shouldn't wait for feedback to be given to you 

what we call push feedback 

but rather you should actively ask for feedback

what we call pulling feedback

Pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner

and puts the power in your hands

The most challenging situations

are actually the ones that call for the most skillful feedback

But it doesn't have to be hard

Now that you know this fourpart formula

you can mix and match it to make it work for any difficult conversation

When you think about money and your dreams

and you're looking at your account

you're like My bank account does not align with my dreams

[The Way We Work]

Financial health for a typical American household can be stressful

We know that  percent of all Americans would struggle

coming up with  dollars in the event of an emergency

And  percent of all Americans will face that emergency

within  months or less

When you ask the question What does money mean to you

most people will say things like I feel anxious

And so the insecurities come The shame comes
 
I think we have a fraught relationship with money

because it comes with judgment

When you're not able to pay your bills on time

you can personalize that

I don't want anyone to think that I'm not smart

I don't want anyone to know that I am very insecure with money

I don't want anyone to know that I am super stressed out

So now let's change the narrative

[ lessons on how to improve our relationship with money]
[]
[ Talk about it]
[]
You can't do it alone And that's when your squad has to come in
 
It's taboo

We typically don't talk about our stresses when it comes to money

We need to come together as a group of friends

no judgment no shame

Celebrate the fact that we've made a decision

that we want to have a better relationship with money

That is worth applauding or snapping your fingers about

Once you've done that then you get real

Nothing should be offlimits

Where does this relationship come from

Why am I spending all this money on things that don't align with my goals

What are your fears What are your hopes What are your dreams
  
But then we start to take action

What can we do this week Or what can we do this month
 
[ Understand what money is]

Money is not the endall beall

It's the mechanism to accomplish whatever your goals are

It does not define you

It's just a mechanism to accomplish what matters to you most

Ask yourself one fundamental question what are you saving for

If you're saving for a car if you're saving to pay down your debt

if you're saving for that rainy day fund

it will include shortterm goals

and it will include longterm goals

[  and then really picture it]
[
Visualize what you're really trying to accomplish

A vision board is visual representation

of what you're saving for

So if we break it down go get a poster board

Get your markers get your glitter

Take magazine pictures cut it all out

Have that picture of that great trip

Have the picture of you paying down your student debt

The vision board sounds like Oh how can that really help

The point is your goals need to align with your behaviors

and the vision board is really a representation

of where you wanna go and then how you live your life

and in the meantime are the steps to really get there

[ It's not what you make it's what you keep]
[]
It's not about what you make it's about what you keep

It's about understanding do I have the ability

with what I'm making to take care of my basic needs

And if not what adjustments do I need to make

And then we start to break it down and talk about the tools

We start to say Do we have our savings account autosave

Set it and forget it or every day put a dollar a day

Whatever that rhythm is for you

the goal is the rhythm not the amount

You can start slow

You can start small but you have to start now

And then let me give you a trick we all have impulses

Many times because the phone is always with us

we start shopping

Go out to any site shop up put it in your cart

Just don't hit buy

Wait  hours go back and ask yourself

Do I really need it

What about these items map to my goal

And if it's nothing hit delete and you got your fix
delete
[ Be good to yourself]
[]
It's also important to know

that your selfworth is not determined by your net worth

This is something that we can do better about

You celebrate your wins

And when you make that misstep no judgment no shame

Just get back at it

When I was pregnant I just got very frustrated

Why did you make that choice Why didn't you make a different choice
 
I felt like I was being told to do things and I never got the answer to why

[The Way We Work]

Sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can't seem to win

If I go back to work I spend less time with my kid

What if they don't get the attention they need to adequately develop

If I stay home and give up my income stream

will I look back and regret my decision

There's a lot of conflicting advice out there

about whether to stay home or go back to work

so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and emotional

You love your kids and want what's best for them

but how do you determine what best means when everyone has a different opinion

There are many variations of parents that a household can have

and I think more families should be asking the question

of whether it makes sense for the male partner to stay home

But the truth is that in the current time

most of the discussions about stayathome parents

focus on women in particular

And it's usually the women who say they feel

that what they do during the day is gonna determine at a deep level

what kind of mom and person they are

That is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent

And when you're met with the sideeye

after telling someone you're going back to work or not

it can poke holes in your confidence

I decided to dig in and find out

Is it better to stay at home or go back to work

It's an emotional decision yes

but as an economist I've learned that we can use data

to help navigate through those emotional decisions

and feel confident we're making the best decision for our family

Specifically there are three main factors you should consider before you decide

First you need to think about

how this decision will affect your family budget

Let's do some numbers

Say your total household income is  dollars

with you and your partner making  each

That means you bring home about  dollars after taxes

If both of you work

and the family pays  dollars a month for childcare

your total disposable income would be  dollars a year

Are you with me so far

If you decide to stay home

your family makes less but you don't pay for childcare

Your disposable income goes down in this scenario

but not by as much as it would if you didn't factor in the childcare

It becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area

A fulltime nanny can run   dollars a year

depending on where you live

If that's the case in your neighborhood in the scenario I outlined

it would completely wipe out one parent's income

and you'd be better off financially with one parent staying home

Of course this is only a shortterm analysis

Childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school

and you may make a higher income later so you wanna factor that in if you can

Once you've done the math you'll know what's possible

and you'll be able to make a more informed choice

which should feel empowering

Second it's time to talk about what's best for your child

You may think this should be the core of your decision

but there's actually no right answer

According to studies from Europe and the US

the decision to go back to work or stay at home

won't actually make or break your child's future success

Research shows that two parents working fulltime

has a similar effect on your child's future test scores and income

to one parent working and one not

What seems to be most important is the environment

your child is in during their spare time

As long as they're engaging in enriching activities

reading practicing their motor skills interacting with other kids

they're gonna thrive whether or not you're at home with them

There is a bit of nuance in the data

For example studies have found

that if both parents work

kids from poor families are impacted positively

and kids from richer families are impacted less positively

So depending on your household configuration

the effects on your child could be a little positive

or a little negative

but the overall impact is negligible

Now I wanna call out an exception maternity leave

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that babies do better

when their mothers take some maternity leave

The early days with your child can impact their development

so if you have paid leave you should take it

and if you don't maybe consider

taking some unpaid leave for those first few months

if your budget allows

And finally ask yourself what do I want

While this may seem simple

it's the factor that feels most taboo to explore

In talking to parents I find that when a woman chooses to stay home

she often feels obligated to say

she made this choice for her children's optimal development

Which sure can be part of the reason

but a perfectly acceptable answer is this is the lifestyle I prefer

or this is what works for my family

The same goes for the working mother

Saying I like my job and that's why I went back to work is enough

If you wanna go back to work that's great

You're lucky to have a job that you love

and you have every right to keep it once you become a parent

Be honest with yourself about what you'd like to do

If you're upfront about that you're guaranteed to feel happier

which will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be

and isn't that the whole point

There is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting

The best decision is the one

that will make you  and your family  the happiest

Up to you to decide what's next

By acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not

is just that a choice

with factors pushing you in various directions

we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best for our families

I was not one of those kids

that knew exactly what they wanted to do when they were growing up

In the last  years of my career

I've been an English teacher attorney video game creator

and now a toilet paper salesman

selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year

[The Way We Work]
[]
Life is about finding the intersection of what you really really love

with what you're really really good at

As simple as it sounds it's really not that easy to find

After a brief stint as an English teacher

I went to law school and ended up becoming an attorney

at a big law firm here in New York City

Like most Americans for the next two three years

I was holding on to my job for dear life

working really late hours at a job that I thought maybe I was good at

but certainly not one that I really loved

I then came upon the epiphany

that it takes years if not tens of thousands of hours

to get really good at something

I really didn't have a lot of time to waste

This talk isn't for those looking to quit their job

because they don't like their boss or they had a long day at work

This is for those that are ready to make the completely scary leap

into a brandnew career

So as you think about making a career change

here are a few tips I hope you consider

and a few things I've picked up along the way

First there's three things to think about before you're ready to move on

Number one professional life is about learning

If you're not even interested in learning anymore

that's a huge red flag

that there might not be a future for you in that industry

Number two career changes are often gutdriven

If you constantly have sleepless nights

where you're wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking

Oh man I can't live with myself if I never try to make this change
 
or if I don't even actually investigate it

then trust your gut

It might be time for that career change

On the flip side

one reason to not move on is shortterm pain

If you don't like your boss

or people at the office are grating on you

that's actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career

because when you do change a career

you generally have to start from the bottom

and you'll probably feel a lot of shortterm pain

whether it's through a lack of salary or lack of a title

Pain at any job is inevitable

So now you're convinced that it's time to change your career

Then there's three things to do immediately

First network network network

No one ever builds a career without a good mentor

or a good support network

What I mean by networking is getting all the great advice

that you can possibly get

Technology has made it so simple to reach out to new people

to say Hey I'm thinking about making a career change

Do you have just five minutes to chat with me

That passion and that hunger and that ability to be a sponge

really attracts awesome mentors

and people willing to give you their time

to give you some good advice

So go out there and meet new people

The second thing you need to do immediately

is shore up your finances

The reality is when you change your career

you'll either start with a job with a lower title

or lower pay or maybe even no pay

especially if you're starting your own business

So going out there and making sure your finances are in order

to make the transition less painful

is really really important

For me personally as I made the transition from being an attorney

over to a video game creator

I wanted to have at least six to  months of personal runway in the bank

Six to  months might not be the right number for you

but be honest with yourself on what that number should be

Number three if you're not ready to make the full jump right at this moment

then get your side hustle on

Side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization

that's in the new industry you want to go into

could be starting your business parttime on the weekends

It's a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something

So you're ready to make the move

or maybe you already made the move

Here are three things you should think about doing right now

One do not  I repeat  do not burn bridges

You spent years building those bridges

why burn them now

The world is such a small place

especially with all these online platforms

that believe me you will see these people again

and probably in the most inopportune times

Number two take stock of what you've learned

in your previous career or careers

Most likely a lot of those things are really applicable

to your new job and your new career

whether it's interacting with people playing on a team

or dealing with jerks and assholes

All those things are really universally applicable

You'll find jerks no matter what industry you're in

no one's immune to it everyone's got to figure it out

and you probably know how to do it already

Lastly when you start your new job you're going to be nervous

But don't worry take a deep breath

because this is what I want to tell you

you're part of a new team now

and everyone around you is rooting for your success

because your success is their success

So welcome to your new career

So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note

It's probably been a while

[The Way We Work]
[]
Technology has changed the way we communicate

We send emails not letters

text messages not phone calls

We order delivery instead of cooking dinners in our kitchen

All in the name of efficiency

But here's the point

Technology has made it easier to communicate

But it hasn't made it easier to connect

with other human beings

I've found that the secret to connecting

in the hightech fastpaced world that we live in

is doing a few small things the oldfashioned way

Write a letter

I've written thousands of handwritten notes

Thanking people for advice thanking them for an interview

It just puts that extra effort to show someone that you really care

and that you're willing to go above and beyond

Some advice for writing a thankyou letter is to really make it clear

to the person that you're writing to

the impact that they have had on your life

Talk about something specific

Like Thank you for the advice that you gave me

It's because of the advice you gave me that I am now doing x
x
People are looking to make a difference

And so if you can show someone that they've really had an impact

on the life that you're living the life you're pursuing

it could have a huge impact

Pick up the phone and dial

We've hired thousands of employees

And I've personally called every single one of them

to welcome them to the Compass family

I'm able to set the tone of really what I want the company to be

Where you know people go above and beyond

to make people feel welcomed and to give people a sense of belonging

And sometimes I call people on their last day of work

When people leave sometimes they're more transparent

than they ever were when they were still at the company

And so it's a great opportunity to get feedback

that is very hard to get otherwise

Ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the office

When I'm traveling the country

every night I'll have dinner with people in the company

And I like to ask questions like What's your underlying motivation

What's something that's happened this week that meant a lot to you

And when you go around the table

and people really open up and are able to engage

it sets a different tone

When people come back to the office

they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way

Answer questions with honesty

You know how it feels when you go into an elevator

and someone says How was your weekend

It could've been the best weekend ever you could've met the love of your life

and you would say Good how was yours

If you want to connect with people then you have to open up

I'm not always that good at it and I imagine most people aren't

But that's why being open stands out so much

because most people aren't

Turn the video on

I would always recommend a videoconference over a phone call

Because that's when you can see the real personality come out

When you're on video you're forced to be present

It's almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment

Nobody succeeds alone

The more you can take time

to develop genuine authentic relationships

the more you're going to be able to realize your dreams

You're going to be able to take big risks and know that there's a network of people

to cheer you on and to support your efforts

Riding a wave is like suddenly gaining speed

and gliding at the same time

Like walking on water like flying

I think it's really about being one with a natural phenomenon

[Small thing Big idea]
[ ]
The surfboard requires a lot of ergonomic thinking

How do I stand on it How do I not slip off
 
But at the same time

it really has to work in that fluid environment

It's really considered for the rider in some areas

and for water and physics in others

A surfboard is made out of a core element

which tends to be foam which makes the board float

and the skin of the board is some kind of resin

epoxy sometimes fiberglass

There often is also a stringer

a wood piece down the middle

which makes it stronger

The rocker is the curvature of the board in the front

That is important because that determines

what kind of wave you will be able to take

how steep the wave is

The tail affects performance

Different tails will make the board react differently

so it's a lot about personal preference

Our understanding of surfing

comes from when the Tahitians in  AD brought it to Hawaii

So when James Cook arrived around 

he was mesmerized by hundreds of people in the water

children women men surfing naked

Calvinist missionaries arrive

and they're scandalized by it

It becomes an illegal activity

It becomes counterculture

The father of modern surfing is a Hawaiian named Duke Kahanamoku
Kahanamoku
He is an extraordinary swimmer

wins gold at the Olympics in 

Goes around the world to show his swimming

but brings surfboards and demonstrates surfing

Imagine people had never seen surfing before

Suddenly some person from a faraway place

is standing on water riding on water

He comes back to Hawaii

and they start to make more boards

PreSecond World War

you're still looking at big heavy wood boards

PostSecond World War

new materials and new technologies become available

and those make the board lighter more accessible cheaper

but it continues to be a custom object

something that is made specifically for a person

or for a certain spot

It's a very symbiotic relationship

between surfer and shaper

There's so many different criteria

that affect the physics of how that surfboard

is moving in water

A longboard is typically used on smaller waves

The riding has a lot of style

You can walk the board

put your toes over it do a hang ten

A shortboard will be faster

They're harder to ride they sink under the body

Board design comes at the intersection between those physical factors

and really how I want to put myself in the water

It's an expression as much as it is a physical activity

The draw may be because water is so elusive

You can't fight it you can't change it

The best I can do is recognize what it does

The surf may be big and getting bigger

and surging while you're in the water

The elements are changing

The wind is coming up

You have to be in symbiosis with the environment

You need to look and feel for everything

that's happening around you

And yet it's so short

Five eight  seconds

It's fleeting but you have to go back to it

Growing up in central Wisconsin I spent a lot of time outside

In the spring I'd smell the heady fragrance of lilacs

In the summer I loved the electric glow of fireflies

as they would zip around on muggy nights

In the fall the bogs were brimming with the bright red of cranberries

Even winter had its charms

with the Christmassy bouquet emanating from pine trees

For me nature has always been a source of wonder and inspiration

As I went on to graduate school in chemistry and in later years

I came to better understand the natural world in molecular detail

All the things that I just mentioned

from the scents of lilacs and pines

to the bright red of cranberries and the glow of fireflies

have at least one thing in common

they're manufactured by enzymes

As I said I grew up in Wisconsin so of course I like cheese

and the Green Bay Packers

But let's talk about cheese for a minute

For at least the last  years

humans have extracted a mixture of enzymes

from the stomachs of cows and sheep and goats

and added it to milk

This causes the milk to curdle  it's part of the cheesemaking process

The key enzyme in this mixture is called chymosin

I want to show you how that works

Right here I've got two tubes

and I'm going to add chymosin to one of these

Just a second here

Now my son Anthony who is eight years old

was very interested in helping me figure out a demo for the TED Talk
TED
and so we were in the kitchen we were slicing up pineapples

extracting enzymes from red potatoes

and doing all kinds of demos in the kitchen

And in the end though

we thought the chymosin demo was pretty cool

And so what's happening here

is the chymosin is swimming around in the milk

and it's binding to a protein there called casein

What it does then is it clips the casein 

it's like a molecular scissors

It's that clipping action that causes the milk to curdle

So here we are in the kitchen working on this

OK

So let me give this a quick zip

And then we'll set these to the side and let these simmer for a minute

OK

If DNA is the blueprint of life
DNA
enzymes are the laborers that carry out its instructions

An enzyme is a protein that's a catalyst

it speeds up or accelerates a chemical reaction

just as the chymosin over here is accelerating the curdling of the milk

But it's not just about cheese

While enzymes do play an important role in the foods that we eat

they also are involved in everything from the health of an infant

to attacking the biggest environmental challenges

we have today

The basic building blocks of enzymes are called amino acids

There are  common amino acids

and we typically designate them with singleletter abbreviations

so it's really an alphabet of amino acids

In an enzyme these amino acids are strung together

like pearls on a necklace

And it's really the identity of the amino acids

which letters are in that necklace

and in what order they are what they spell out

that gives an enzyme its unique properties and differentiates it from other enzymes

Now this string of amino acids

this necklace

folds up into a higherorder structure

And if you were to zoom in at the molecular level

and take a look at chymosin which is the enzyme working over here

you would see it looks like this

It's all these strands and loops and helices and twists and turns

and it has to be in just this conformation to work properly

Nowadays we can make enzymes in microbes

and that can be like a bacteria or a yeast for example

And the way we do this is we get a piece of DNA
DNA
that codes for an enzyme that we're interested in

we insert that into the microbe

and we let the microbe use its own machinery its own wherewithal

to produce that enzyme for us

So if you wanted chymosin you wouldn't need a calf nowadays 

you could get this from a microbe

And what's even cooler I think

is we can now dial in completely custom DNA sequences
DNA
to make whatever enzymes we want

stuff that's not out there in nature

And to me what's really the fun part

is trying to design an enzyme for a new application

arranging the atoms just so

The act of taking an enzyme from nature and playing with those amino acids

tinkering with those letters

putting some letters in taking some letters out

maybe rearranging them a little bit

is a little bit like finding a book

and editing a few chapters or changing the ending

In  the Nobel prize in chemistry

was given for the development of this approach

which is known as directed evolution

Nowadays we can harness the powers of directed evolution

to design enzymes for custom purposes

and one of these is designing enzymes for doing applications in new areas

like laundry

So just as enzymes in your body

can help you to break down the food that you eat

enzymes in your laundry detergent

can help you to break down the stains on your clothes

It turns out that about  percent of the energy

that goes into doing the wash

is from water heating

And that's for good reason 

the warmer water helps to get your clothes clean

But what if you were able to do the wash in cold water instead

You certainly would save some money

and in addition to that

according to some calculations done by Procter and Gamble
ProcterGamble
if all households in the US were to do the laundry in cold water

we would save the emissions of  metric tons of CO each year

That's a lot

that's about the equivalent

of the carbon dioxide emitted by  million cars

So how would we go about designing an enzyme

to realize these changes

Enzymes didn't evolve to clean dirty laundry

much less in cold water

But we can go to nature and we can find a starting point

We can find an enzyme that has some starting activity

some clay that we can work with

So this is an example of such an enzyme right here on the screen

And we can start playing with those amino acids as I said

putting some letters in taking some letters out

rearranging those

And in doing so we can generate thousands of enzymes

And we can take those enzymes

and we can test them in little plates like this

So this plate that I'm holding in my hands

contains  wells

and in each well is a piece of fabric with a stain on it

And we can measure how well each of these enzymes

are able to remove the stains from the pieces of fabric

and in that way see how well it's working

And we can do this using robotics

like you'll see in just a second on the screen

OK so we do this and it turns out

that some of the enzymes are sort of in the ballpark

of the starting enzyme

That's nothing to write home about

Some are worse so we get rid of those

And then some are better

Those improved ones become our version s
s
Those are the enzymes that we want to carry forward

and we can repeat this cycle again and again

And it's the repetition of this cycle that lets us come up with a new enzyme

something that can do what we want

And after several cycles of this

we did come up with something new

So you can go to the supermarket today and you can buy a laundry detergent

that lets you do the wash in cold water because of enzymes like this here

And I want to show you how this one works too

So I've got two more tubes here

and these are both milk again

And let me show you

I've got one that I'm going to add this enzyme to

and one that I'm going to add some water to

And that's the control

so nothing should happen in that tube

You might find it curious that I'm doing this with milk

But the reason that I'm doing this

is because milk is just loaded with proteins

and it's very easy to see this enzyme working in a protein solution

because it's a master protein chopper

that's its job

So let me get this in here

And you know as I said it's a master protein chopper

and what you can do is you can extrapolate what it's doing in this milk

to what it would be doing in your laundry

So this is kind of a way to visualize what would be happening

OK so those both went in

And I'm going to give this a quick zip as well

OK so we'll let these sit over here with the chymosin sample

so I'm going to come back to those toward the end

Well what's on the horizon for enzyme design

Certainly it will get it faster 

there are now approaches for evolving enzymes

that allow researchers to go through far more samples

than I just showed you

And in addition to tinkering with natural enzymes

like we've been talking about

some scientists are now trying to design enzymes from scratch

using machine learning an approach from artificial intelligence

to inform their enzyme designs

Still others are adding unnatural amino acids to the mix

We talked about the  natural amino acids

the common amino acids before 

they're adding unnatural amino acids

to make enzymes with properties unlike those that could be found in nature

That's a pretty neat area

How will designed enzymes affect you in years to come

Well I want to focus on two areas

human health and the environment

Some pharmaceutical companies

now have teams that are dedicated to designing enzymes

to make drugs more efficiently and with fewer toxic catalysts

For example Januvia
Januvia
which is a medication to treat type  diabetes

is made partially with enzymes

The number of drugs made with enzymes is sure to grow in the future

In another area

there are certain disorders

in which a single enzyme in a person's body doesn't work properly

An example of this is called phenylketonuria

or PKU for short
PKU
People with PKU are unable to properly metabolize or digest phenylalanine
PKU
which is one of the  common amino acids that we've been talking about

The consequence of ingesting phenylalanine for people with PKU
PKU
is that they are subject to permanent intellectual disabilities

so it's a scary thing to have

Now those of you with kids 

do you guys have kids here which ones have kids

A lot of you

So may be familiar with PKUs
PKU
because all infants in the US are required to be tested for PKU
PKU
I remember when Anthony my son had his heel pricked to test for it

The big challenge with this is What do you eat

Phenylalanine is in so many foods it's incredibly hard to avoid

Now Anthony has a nut allergy and I thought that was tough

but PKU's on another level of toughness

However new enzymes may soon enable PKU patients
PKU
to eat whatever they want

Recently the FDA approved an enzyme designed to treat PKU
FDAPKU
This is big news for patients

and it's actually very big news

for the field of enzymereplacement therapy more generally

because there are other targets out there where this would be a good approach

So that was a little bit about health

Now I'm going to move to the environment

When I read about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch 

by the way that's like this huge island of plastic

somewhere between California and Hawaii 

and about microplastics pretty much everywhere

it's upsetting

Plastics aren't going away anytime soon

But enzymes may help us in this area as well

Recently bacteria producing plasticdegrading enzymes were discovered

Efforts are already underway to design improved versions

of these enzymes

At the same time there are enzymes that have been discovered

and that are being optimized

to make nonpetroleumderived biodegradable plastics

Enzymes may also offer some help in capturing greenhouse gases

such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide

Now there is no doubt these are major challenges

and none of them are easy

But our ability to harness enzymes may help us to tackle these in the future

so I think that's another area to be looking forward

So now I'm going to get back to the demo 

this is the fun part

So we'll start with the chymosin samples

So let me get these over here

And you can see here

this is the one that got the water

so nothing should happen to this milk

This is the one that got the chymosin

So you can see that it totally clarified up here

There's all this curdled stuff that's cheese

we just made cheese in the last few minutes

So this is that reaction

that people have been doing for thousands and thousands of years

I'm thinking about doing this one at our next Kids to Work Day demo

but they can be a tough crowd so we'll see

Laughter

And then the other one I want to look at is this one

So this is the enzyme for doing your laundry

And you can see that it's different than the one that has the water added

It's kind of clarifying

and that's just what you want for an enzyme in your laundry

because you want to be able to have an enzyme

that can be a protein chowhound just chew them up

because you're going to get different protein stains on your clothes

like chocolate milk or grass stains for example

and something like this is going to help you get them off

And this is also going to be the thing that allows you

to do the wash in cold water reduce your carbon footprint

and save you some money

Well we've come a long way

considering this year journey from enzymes in cheese making

to the present day and enzyme design

We're really at a creative crossroads

and with enzymes can edit what nature wrote

or write our own stories with amino acids

So next time you're outdoors on a muggy night

and you see a firefly

I hope you think of enzymes

They're doing amazing things for us today

And by design

they could be doing even more amazing things tomorrow

Thank you

You never give it any thought

and there are billions of them out there

but the amount of design and passion and creativity

that goes into this little disc is remarkable

[Small thing]
[
[Big idea]
[]
The coffee cup lid is a lid for your coffee cup

It snaps on

It has an opening

You've got lids with a little latch that opens and closes

You've got ones that are in creative shapes

Coffee cup lids have their own vocabulary

People talk about the peripheral skirts

the pressin dimples the fragrance outlets

the slosh factor

But you need these words

because so much thought and innovation

goes into these coffee cup lids

Our society is just more and more mobile

Everything is on the move

The good part it's convenient

You can drink coffee anywhere you don't have the stay in the diner

It can be in the subway You can be walking
 
The bad part is it's harder to savor a coffee

when you're taking it on the road

The first patent for a lid on a cup

was in 

but it was for cold beverages

And in  this guy named James Reifsnyder

invented the first snapon lid

But it didn't have an opening for drinking

In the 's there was this huge cultural shift

where people started drinking coffee on the move

And Eleven was the first to sell coffee to go

And then came this revolution in 

A man named Alan Frank invented a lid

that you could peel a tab off

like in the shape of a guitar pick

and drink it from there

In  another big advance

you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself

So more and more people started drinking coffee on the go

In  a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids

the birth of the traveler lid

And it is iconic  you've seen it a million times

And it solved a whole host of problems

It's designed so that you don't splash your face

because it's higher than any of the other ones

And it's got this protruding rim

so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips

It's got a small depression in the center for your nose

so you can really get in there and get maximum aroma

It's got this tiny air hole that lets the steam out

and stops it from creating a vacuum

This is one of those objects where you just don't notice it

until it dribbles on your lap

So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve

and you're going to see a move away from singleuse plastic lids

to lids that are a little more sustainable

We're not going to stop moving

We're not going to stop drinking coffee

And I think that's what these coffee lid engineers are trying to do

is to make it so that the experience of taking it on the road

is as good as sitting in a restaurant drinking from a ceramic cup

Because you know coffee is serious business

When I first became a doctor

in Benin City Nigeria

some odd years ago

I was drawn to help people live full lives

But often I found myself feeling impotent

Here I was a brandnew doctor with all these skills

but I couldn't cure my patients who had chronic diseases 

illnesses like heart disease asthma diabetes 

and needed more than just handing them a prescription

or providing grief counseling in the office to get the job done

Fastforward  years later

I'm in Atlanta Georgia

it's a different world

but it was dj vu all over again

As doctors we see our patients who have chronic illnesses

in an episodic way

In between

the patients have to learn how to make a lot of decisions for themselves

I'll give you examples

If you have medications you're supposed to take every day

what do you do when you're sick

Are you still supposed to take it

How do you recognize a complication when it happens

How do you recognize a side effect when it happens

What do you do with it

In addition to all of this

they're dealing with the inevitable loneliness isolation and anxiety

that people who have chronic illnesses deal with

In the US alone six in  adults have a chronic illness

That's  million people

A recent report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

showed that health habits account for  percent

of the health outcomes that people experience

while medical care only accounts for  percent

In fact the Centers for Disease Control

says that if we could eliminate smoking

physical inactivity and poor nutrition

that we can prevent  percent of heart disease

 percent of type  diabetes

and  percent of cancer

But we also know

that changing health behaviors is very difficult

So we asked the question

What if we could create a resource

that could motivate people to change health behavior

The truth is there are a lot of these resources out there

that help people acquire these socalled selfmanagement skills

But many a time they're not easily accessible or relatable

particularly to individuals within minority and underserved communities

who face bias in addition to barriers like language and culture

and inadequate health insurance coverage

And so in the last  years

my colleagues and I at Morehouse School of Medicine

have created a technologybased application

to assist with chronic illness care

It's freely available on the web

and as an app

And what we do is get people to track variables 

blood pressure blood sugar 

and then report it back to them in a colorcoded format

So green would indicate a healthy range

and red would indicate a problem that needs something done about it

We link these stats to a curriculum

The curriculum helps the individual learn about their health condition

whatever the chronic illness is

They also work with a health coach

to learn selfmanagement skills

skills that'll help them prevent complications of their illness

In order for the coach to be successful

they have to be able to gain the trust

of the individual that they're working with

We tested this application

in clinics where the health coaches were medical assistants

and in a large urban church

where the health coaches were volunteers from the health ministry

A year later a third of the participants

were able to acquire three new selfmanagement skills

and maintain them to the extent that it was able to improve

their blood pressures their blood sugar

and their exercise

Now what was simple yet fascinating to us

was that the group from the church did just as well or even better

than the group that were under purely medical care

And we wanted to learn why that was

So we looked a little further into the research 

 hours of recorded conversation 

and what we learned was that the coaches from the church

did have more time to spend with the patients

they had access to the patients' families

and so they could figure out what people needed

and provide those resources for them

My team and I call this culturally congruent coaching

To illustrate this concept of culturally congruent coaching

I want to tell you about one of our patients

I'll call her Ms Bertha

So Ms Bertha is an yearold lady with diabetes and hypertension

She was assigned to Anne her health coach in the church

Anne also happened to be a family friend to Ms Bertha for many years

and they were fellow congregants

Anne observed after the first few visits

that even though Ms Bertha faithfully recorded her stats

they were all showing up as red

So she probed a little deeper

to try to understand what was going on with Ms Bertha

and Ms Bertha gave her the realreal

Laughter

She told her that there were times

when her medications made her feel weird

and she wouldn't take them the way they were prescribed

because she thought it was due to the medicines

but she didn't tell her doctor that

She also skipped out on some doctor appointments

for a variety of reasons

but one of them was she wasn't doing better

and she didn't want to make her doctor mad

so she just didn't go

So Anne talked to Ms Bertha

and asked her to bring her daughter in for the next visit which she did

And at that visit

Anne was able to print out a log of all these stats

that Ms Bertha had been collecting

gave them to her and encouraged them to go see the doctor together

which they did

With that information

the doctor was able to make changes to Ms Bertha's treatment

Within three months Ms Bertha's numbers were all in the green

No one was more excited or surprised than Ms Bertha herself

Now Anne was successful as a health coach

because she cared enough to go below the surface

and probe Ms Bertha's deep culture

and was able to reach her at that level

She knew how to listen

and she knew how to ask the right questions

to get to what was needed

We all have deep unconscious rules

that drive the way we make our health decisions

That's our culture

The relationship and the conversation between Anne and Ms Bertha

illustrates what's possible

when we have conversations with our patients

our friends and our neighbors

on a deep cultural level

And personally I'm beyond excited

to think that with this simple concept of culturally congruent coaching

we could change the lives of  million Americans

and many others across the world

that are living with chronic diseases

Thank you

What is the most beautiful place you have ever been

And when you were there did you take a picture of it

Here's a place that tops that list for me

This is Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park in Utah
Mesa Arch
at sunrise

It's the traditional homeland of the Pueblo Ute

Paiute and Navajo people

and when you are there

it is absolutely stunning

The sunrise illuminates the bottom of the arch orange

and then behind it you see the buttes and clouds and cliffs

But what you might not see from my photo here

is the  people behind me who were also taking photos

And these are just the committed people the sunrise people right

So when you think about that

there must be hundreds if not thousands of photos of Mesa Arch taken every week
Mesa Arch
I've been sharing my photography on Instagram for years
Instagram
and it started to become really interesting and funny even

just how many similar photos of the same places

I started to see online

And I was participating in it

So this made me wonder

Why are we taking photos in the first place

Sometimes I visit a popular landmark 

this one is Horseshoe Bend in Arizona 

and I see all the people with their phones and cameras out

who snap a photo

just to turn and get back in the car or walk back to the trailhead

And sometimes it seems like we are missing the point

of going to this place to experience it for ourselves

or to see it with our own eyes

When I'm behind the camera

I notice the smallest details

the layers of light in the mountains

as the light fades at the end of the day

the shapes that nature so expertly makes

abstract and yet completely perfect

I could go on and on here musing about the intricacies of this planet

and the way that it makes me feel

Photographing the beauty and complexity of this world

for me is like making a portrait of someone that I love

And when I make a photograph

I have to think about what I want it to say

I have to ask myself what I want it to feel like

When you're communicating through an image

every creative choice matters

Sometimes I plan to share my images

and other times I take them just for myself

I currently host a video series on the future of the outdoors

and for one of the episodes we wanted to explore

the relationship between photography and outdoor spaces

I learned about the research of Kristin Diehl

and her colleagues at USC

who studied phototaking's effect on enjoyment levels

They found that when we're behind the camera

when we're the ones taking the picture

we enjoy our experiences more not less

But it wasn't true all the time

If the person took the photo solely with the intention of sharing it

there was no increase in enjoyment

because they didn't do it for themselves

So this points to an important distinction

photography can enhance your experience

if it's done intentionally

The intention piece is what matters

As a photographer I've really had to check myself on this

When does it help me to have my camera out

and when do I just need to put it away

On a trip to Alaska I had the opportunity to photograph Alaskan brown bears

I was on a boat with four other photographers

and we were all having our minds blown

at the same time

in such close proximity to these animals

It's an emotional experience

Being eye to eye with these bears gave me a feeling of connection

that transcends words

and having my camera with me in this case enhanced that

We were all creating independently but also all completely in the moment

both with nature and with each other

I so clearly remember

capturing the water droplets and the motion as the bears swam

and the cute cubs following their mothers

That group and I will have that experience together

and these images to look back on

time and time again

and photography is what enabled us to share this in the first place

Other times I choose to leave the camera behind

and I think that choice ultimately improves both my experience

and my work

I recently flew to the South Pacific island of Tonga

to swim with humpback whales

I noticed myself feeling pressure

and a certain obligation to take the camera with me

when sometimes I just wanted the pure experience itself

And the experience is seriously amazing

You're talking about being in the water

with a curious baby animal the size of a station wagon

while you are surrounded by particles that float around you like glitter

and the mom swims gracefully below you

There were times obviously when I did take my camera with me

and those were really amazing to capture as well

But the setup is pretty big

It's like this big box This is what it looks like
 
And so this is between me and the whales

and at times that feels like a block between you and reality

Is there a difference when it's just your phone

Last year I went to Uluru in Central Australia

which is this massive rock that towers over the desert

This is sacred land to Anangu

who are the Aboriginal people from this area

and the traditional owners of the land

There are particular spots in Uluru that you cannot photograph professionally

because they are culturally sensitive

equivalent to sacred scripture to Anangu

So because of this most of my photographs are from either far away like this one

or from specific angles in the park

You could say that some of the most interesting and beautiful visuals in Uluru

are located in these sensitive areas

but the request not to photograph them is an explicit and direct invitation

to learn more about the land its importance and its people

Isn't that what we should be doing anyway

So my visit to Uluru quickly became not about me

but about connecting with the place

Ironically and unsurprisingly

I have found that presence and connection

also happens to make for more compelling images

We can probably all point to social media

as being a good place to share the images from our travels and from our lives

We not only share pieces of the world that we have seen

but also parts of our daytoday experiences

And if we're applying intentionality to the photos we take

then hopefully we're sharing intentionally too

For me allowing people to see pieces of my story and my perspective online

has reminded me that I'm not alone

It's helped me build support and community

to do the same for others

Let me be clear

I am not trying to discourage you from taking photos

Even if thousands of people have been to whatever exact location

and taken whatever exact photo

I encourage you to get out and create too

The world needs every voice and perspective

and yours is included

But what I'm trying to show you is that the phone or camera

doesn't have to stay out all the time

What I'm trying to encourage you to do

is to put it away just for a moment 

a moment for you

So let's go back to Mesa Arch
Mesa Arch
the way that the rock glows orange

and the lovely layers of blue in the background

What if the next time you were somewhere amazing

you couldn't bring your camera or phone

What if you were not allowed to take any pictures at all

Would it feel like a limitation

Or would it feel like a relief

So what can we do

Well the next time you feel the impulse to take out your camera or phone

or in my case once you realize you have already pulled it out 

Laughter

First stop

Pause

Take a deep breath

Look around What do you notice
 
Are you experiencing this moment with someone else

Remember that this moment only comes once

Photography can be part of a beautiful experience

Just don't let it be a block between you and reality

Be intentional

and don't lose a beautiful irreplaceable memory

because you were too focused on getting the shot

Thank you

It was a fantastic new pink suit

with big buttons and shoulder pads

It was 

and I was the new boss of Griffin's Foods

an iconic cookie and snacks company in New Zealand

It was my first time as the leader of a company

and I was on the stage to give a big speech

about our ambitious new goals

I knew exactly what my call to action was

which was One in every four times a Kiwi eats a snack

it will be one of ours

I emphasized that we knew how to measure our results

and that our future was in our control

Embarrassingly enough

I finished up with If not this what

If not us who

And if not now when

I got this huge round of applause

and I was really really pleased with myself

I wanted so much to be a good leader

I wanted to be followed by a devoted team

I wanted to be right

In short I wanted to be a hero

A hero selling chips and biscuits in a pink suit

Laughter

What happened after that speech

Nothing

All of that applause did not lead to action

Nothing changed

Not because they didn't like me or the message

The problem was that no one knew what they were expected to do

And most importantly

they didn't know that I needed them

Now you may think that this is a classic hero speech

where I'm going to tell you that I overcame that obstacle and triumphed

Actually I'm going to tell you

that in a world as complex and interconnected

as the one we live in

the idea that one person has the answer is ludicrous

It's not only ineffective it's dangerous

because it leads us to believe that it's been solved by that hero

and we have no role

We don't need heroes

We need radical interdependence

which is just another way of saying we need each other

Even though other people can be really difficult sometimes

I spent decades trying to work out how to be a good leader

I've lived in seven countries and five continents

And in recent years

I've spent a lot of time with the B Corp community
B
originally as a corporate participant

and more recently as an ambassador

Now B Corps are a group of companies
B
who believe in business as a force for good

There's a tough certification with about  questions

about your social and environmental performance

You must legally declare your intention

to serve the community as well as your shareholders

and you must sign the declaration of interdependence

Now one of the things that inspires me the most

about the companies in this movement

is that they see themselves as part of a whole system

It's sort of as if they imagine themselves on a big flowing river of activity

where if they are for example soft drinks manufacturers

they understand that upstream from them

there's water and sugar

and farmers that grow that sugar

and plastic and metal and glass

all of which flows into this thing

that we call a company which has financial results

And the flowing continues with consequences

Some of them intended

like refreshment and hydration

and some unintended

like garbage and obesity

Spending time with leaders in this space

has led me to see that true collaboration is possible

but it's subtle and it's complex

And the leaders in this space are doing a few things very differently

from traditional heroic leaders

They set goals differently

they announce those goals differently

and they have a very different relationship with other people

Let's begin with the first difference

A hero sets a goal that can be individually delivered

and neatly measured

You can recognize a heroic goal 

they use terms like revenue and market share

and are often competitive

I mean remember pinksuit day

Interdependent leaders on the other hand

start with a goal that's really important

but is actually impossible to achieve by one company or one person alone

I want to give you an example from the clothing industry

which produces  million tons of waste a year

Patagonia and Eileen Fisher are clothing manufacturers

both of them B Corps
B
both of them deeply committed to reducing waste

They don't see that their responsibility ends

when a customer buys their clothes

Patagonia encourages you not to buy new clothes from them

and will repair your old clothes for free

Eileen Fisher will pay you when you bring back your clothes

and either sell them on or turn them into other clothes

While these two companies are competitive in some ways

they work together and with others in the industry

to solve shared problems

They take responsibility for things that happen upstream as well

Around the world

there are around  million people who work from home in this industry

most of them women

many of them in very difficult circumstances

with poor lighting

sewing on buttons and doing detailed stitching

Until  there was no protection for these workers

A group of companies got together with a notforprofit called Nest
Nest
to create a set of standards

that's now been adopted by the whole industry

Once you've seen problems like this you can't unsee them

so you have to ask others to help you to solve them

These folks take interdependence as a given

and said to me

We don't compete on human rights

The second big difference for collaborators

is their willingness to declare their goals before they have a plan

Now the hero only reveals their carefully crafted goal

when the path to achieve it is clear

In fact the role of the hero announcement is to set the stage for the big win

Hero announcements are full of triumph

Interdependent leaders on the other hand

want other people to help them

so their announcements are often an invitation for cocreation

and sometimes they're a call for help

At the North American division of the French food company Danone

I announced that we wanted to become a B Corp
B
And unlike pinksuit day

I had no plan to get there

I remember the day really clearly

Everybody in the room gasped

because they knew we didn't have a plan

But they also knew that we had seen our role

in the river that is the food system

and we wanted to make a change

Making that declaration without a plan

meant that so many young people in our company

stepped up to help us

and B Corps around us all rallied around
B
And the day we became a B Corp
B
wasn't just a selfcongratulatory moment of a hero company 

it was more like a community celebration

Now when you gave goals that you can't achieve alone

and you've told everyone about them

inevitably you'll end up at the third big difference

which is how you see other people

inside your company and outside

Heroes see everyone as a competitor or a follower

Heroes don't want input

because they want to control everything because they want the credit

And you can see this in a typical hero meeting

Heroes like making speeches

People lean back in their chairs

maybe impressed but not engaged

Interdependent leaders on the other hand

understand that they need other people

They know that meetings are not just mindless calendar fillers

These are the most precious things you have

It's where people collaborate and communicate

and share ideas

People lean forward in meetings like this

wondering where they might fit in

When I was in Shanghai in China

where I lived for six years running the Kraft Foods business

selling amongst other things Oreo cookies

we had a problem with hero culture

We kept on launching new products that failed

And we would find out afterwards

that everyone in the company knew they were going to fail

they just didn't feel free to tell us

So we changed the way we ran our innovation and planning meetings

in two important ways

First of all language went back to Chinese

Because even though everyone spoke great English

when I was in the room and the meeting was in English

they focused on me

And I was the foreigner and I was the boss

and I apparently had that intimidating hero look

The second thing

is we asked every single person in the meeting their opinion

And our understanding of the subtleties of the differences

between American taste and Chinese taste in this case

really improved

and our new product success rate radically turned around

and we launched a lot of winners

including the now famous greenteaflavored Oreos

Hero culture sneaks in everywhere

At Danone we had a lot of great stuff happening

in one part of the world

and we wanted it to spread to another part of the world

But when you put a person in business gear

up in front of a group of people with PowerPoint
PowerPoint
they have the urge to become sort of heroic

And they make everything look super shiny

and they don't tell the truth

And it's not compelling and it's not even interesting

So we changed it

and we created these fullday marketplaces

kind of like a big bazaar

And everybody was dressed up in costume

some people a little some people a lot

And sellers had to man their stalls

and sell their ideas as persuasively as possible

and people who were convinced bought them with fake check books

Creating just a bit of silliness with the environment

and a hat or a scarf

drops people's guard and causes ideas to spread like wildfire

There's no recipe here

but time together has to be carefully curated and created

so that people know that their time is valuable and important

and they can bring their best selves to the table

Hero culture is present right here in TED
TED
This whole process makes it look like I think I'm a hero

So just in case there's any doubt about the point that I'm trying to make

I want to apply these ideas

in an area in which I have zero credibility

and zero experience

I'm originally South African

and I'm deeply passionate about wildlife conservation

most particularly rhinos

Those majestic creatures with big horns

Every day three rhinos are killed

because there are people who think that those horns are valuable

even though they're just made of the same stuff

as hair and fingernails

It breaks my heart

Like all good recovering heroes

I did everything I could to reduce this goal

to something that I could do by myself

But clearly stopping rhino poaching is a goal way too big for me

So I'm immediately in interdependence land

I'm declaring my goal on this stage

I found other people as passionate as I am

and I've asked if I could join them

And after today there may be more

And we're now in the complex but inspiring process

of learning how to work together

My dream is that one day someone will stand on this stage

and tell you how radical interdependence saved my beloved rhinos

Why does hero culture persist

and why don't we work together more

Well I don't know why everyone else does it

but I can tell you why I did it

Interdependence is a lot harder than being a hero

It requires us to be open and transparent and vulnerable

and that's not what traditional leaders have been trained to do

I thought being a hero would keep me safe

I thought that in the elevation

and separation that comes from heroic leadership

that I would be untouchable

This is an illusion

The joy and success that comes from interdependence and vulnerability

is worth the effort and the risk

And if we're going to solve the challenges that the world is facing today

we have no alternative

so we had better start getting good at it

Thank you

So I've been thinking about how to explain this concept to you

and I've decided I'm just going to start with something we all understand

To achieve great heights or change the world

no matter how smart we are we all need people

And for conventional people

the universe seems to conspire to make them successful

For the unconventional

I think we need something that I like to call coconspirators

Coconspirators are different not because they're different themselves

but because of the people who need them

They tend to be people who are willing to bend the rules 

actually even break them sometimes 

and challenge the status quo

to stand beside someone who is going against societal norms

I'm actually going to describe an experience that I had

that first crystallized the idea of coconspirators in my mind

In 

I was a corporate executive with an American multinational in India

and we were actually faced with an interesting problem

we didn't have enough women in the workforce

And just to give you some context

 percent of women work in India

If you look at most of Asia

that number is around  percent

So we knew the numbers were deplorable

and it was manifesting itself in our own organization

So we decided  actually I'll just give you a quick example

of a young engineer a yearold woman

who told us a great story about her daily life

to just exemplify it for us

She said As I walk out of the house in the morning

I am running around doing a bunch of chores

and my motherinlaw  I live with my inlaws 

is starting to get a little bit irritated

because she's going to be left with all the housework to do

And then as I get back home in the evening

I've overshot the time I'm going to be home by an hour or two at least

and by then two of my biggest champions

my fatherinlaw and my husband

are also starting to get a little bit irritated

And my motherinlaw is furious because she's taken care of everything

that needs to be done

And through the middle of the day

I'm actually surrounded by men my age

and there's only one expectation from them by society

It's to achieve in their careers

and provide for their families financially

How do you expect me to bring this same level of enthusiasm

excitement and passion to the workplace

And she was right

And I thought the women's network volunteers

came up with a great idea

They instituted a bring your motherinlaw to work day

So we heralded a group of mothersinlaw

and a few mothers into the office

and we took them to our R and D labs

We took them to the medical equipment

that their daughtersinlaw were creating and building

And as we did we described to them what their daughtersinlaw actually did

they impacted maternal mortality rates and infant mortality rates

They brought them down

They identified complex diseases

early enough to be able to prevent and cure them

And then we took them to lunch

We gave them a lavish lunch and thanked them for the role they played

for freeing up a young woman to work shoulder to shoulder with us

to literally change the world

There wasn't a dry eye in the room

Every one of these women were grateful and proud

They were proud of who their daughtersinlaw were

but they were grateful to be included as part of the conversation

And I wondered at the time

whether what we'd done was just a great touchyfeely moment

and was cute

but really wasn't going to have longterm impact

And a couple of days later one of my mentees swung by my office

and she was super excited

She said I went home from work yesterday

and I was bracing myself because I was really late

and I was bracing myself for a lecture

and my motherinlaw turned to my husband and said

'Can you please get up and make her a cup of tea

She's exhausted

She's saving lives You work at a bank'
 
Laughter

And there you had it

You had the perfect coconspirator

someone that we don't always recognize or value

but was changing the way somebody else could challenge the status quo

by standing beside her

and questioning the societal norms

and making a difference

The next example I'm going to use will be closer to almost everyone in this room

When I graduated from business school and started working in a company

a group of us my peers and I were asked to work on a strategy

for a business that hadn't been doing too well over the last decade

and was being neglected

We put our hearts and souls into it

and we did a lot of analysis on our nights and weekends

and put together what we thought was a good strategy

And after presenting it to a number of people

that we were getting buyin with

we were actually asked to present to the global CEO

at his annual strategy meet that happened over a week

And we were both excited and apprehensive as we flew into headquarters

We were excited because this was an opportunity

to show how much we had learned

But we were also nervous because though a brilliant dynamic man

he had a fiery temper and wasn't really the easiest person to present to

Five or six hours before our presentation a senior colleague pulled us aside

and sat down and gave us a frontseat view of what had happened all week

We knew about people who had bombed their presentations

We knew about people who had almost been instantaneously promoted in the room

We knew what was keeping the CEO up at night

and what he thought were tailwinds to the business

And when we walked into that presentation later in the day

we actually got buyin with both the CEO

and his senior staff

And it wasn't just because of our analysis or our strategy

It was because we were prepped

to be able to communicate in a way that the team could absorb

Now this senior colleague of ours didn't pull us aside

because he wanted to gossip

He pulled us aside because he believed we were unconventional in the boardroom

That unconventionality was exactly why he wanted us to think about

this new fresh perspective

and provide a view on where this business should go

But he also knew it was a distinct disadvantage for us

because we didn't know how to present in that room

and we hadn't done it before

and they weren't used to receiving us

And that again is an example in my mind

of somebody bending the rules

Because he decided to coconspire with us

he not only changed the career trajectories

of six young people in the organization who suddenly got all this visibility

but he actually changed the trajectory of a business

that people were neglecting and didn't have any fresh ideas for

The last example I want to share with you

is actually very far removed from the corporate world

and somewhat personal

This is the story of my mother

In her early s she lost her father

He had passed away in his late s

leaving behind six children

four younger siblings and one older sibling than her

and a widowed mother who had never worked

My mom and her older sister realized

that they actually needed to start earning an income 

they were both in grad school 

to ensure the rest of the siblings could get through their schooling

and start to work

So she shifted her law school classes to evening classes

and she started to work during the day as a schoolteacher

to bring home an income

And every day she would actually get off a bus

at the end of her evening law school classes

on the streets of Calcutta

Now mind you

this is a woman who wasn't used to taking public transportation at all

let alone at night

And as she would get off the bus

she would take about a seven to eightminute walk to her home

from the bus stop

on a street that was largely deserted

because it was a residential street

with some shops that closed around pm or a little bit before that

One day a store owner was closing his store a little bit later than usual

because there was a customer who had actually left a little bit later

And he saw my mother get off the bus

He waited for her

He actually knew the family

The store had been in the neighborhood for more than  years

so he knew her since she was a baby

He watched her walk to the street that her house was on

turned off the lights shut the store and went home

From the next day he found that he waited for her every single day

until he she made her way to her own house

Other store owners on that same street suddenly noticed this one store

that was open longer

and suddenly started to see a bunch of endofday customers walk in

to buy odds and ends that

from after their long day from work and their commute home

realized they hadn't picked up for the next morning

Some people who came in the mornings also started to come the night before

A few of the storekeepers decided that actually what was happening

was he was monopolizing a bunch of customers

and they started to keep their store lights on

and keep their shop open till  o'clock

From that time on my mother had a lit street

with plenty of activity on the street

I believe that that store owner was my mother's coconspirator

Because of him

a small change to what was conventional on that street at the time

allowed for her and her family

to do something that was completely unconventional

A woman her age from an uppermiddleclass family

actually got married at that age

or studied in grad school with the protection of their family

Because of that store owner

all of my mother's siblings went on to become engineers

lawyers accountants and teachers

and my mother went on to become a lawyer

The world needs coconspirators

As we get into a complex environment where more and more complex problems exist

and we need to find more solutions

we need unconventional people in our boardrooms and at the table

For that to happen

we need coconspirators

In my own life

whether it's because of my gender

my ethnicity or sometimes

as I've been living in this part of the world for over a decade my accent

I'm often perceived to be unconventional

It's my coconspirators that have shown me the path forward

and actually it's my coconspirators that keep me seeking out

the unconventional paths to go down

So what I'd like to ask of all of you today

is that you look around and find the people

that inspire you to coconspire

I promise you that your empathy

and your courage

will change someone's life

and may even change the world

Thank you

Let me share a paradox

For the last  years

many companies have been trying to become less bureaucratic

to have fewer central rules and procedures

more autonomy for their local teams to be more agile

And now they are pushing artificial intelligence AI

unaware that cool technology

might make them more bureaucratic than ever

Why

Because AI operates just like bureaucracies

The essence of bureaucracy

is to favor rules and procedures over human judgment

And AI decides solely based on rules
AI
Many rules inferred from past data

but only rules

And if human judgment is not kept in the loop

AI will bring a terrifying form of new bureaucracy 

I call it algocracy 

where AI will take more and more critical decisions by the rules

outside of any human control

Is there a real risk

Yes

I'm leading a team of  AI specialists

We have deployed over  customized AI solutions
AI
for large companies around the world

And I see too many corporate executives behaving like bureaucrats from the past

They want to take costly oldfashioned humans out of the loop

and rely only upon AI to take decisions

I call this the humanzero mindset

And why is it so tempting

Because the other route Human plus AI is long

costly and difficult

Business teams tech teams datascience teams

have to iterate for months

to craft exactly how humans and AI can best work together

Long costly and difficult

But the reward is huge

A recent survey from BCG and MIT
BCGMIT
shows that  percent of companies in the world

are pioneering AI

making money with it

Those companies focus  percent of their AI initiatives

on effectiveness and growth

taking better decisions 

not replacing humans with AI to save costs

Why is it important to keep humans in the loop

Simply because left alone AI can do very dumb things

Sometimes with no consequences like in this tweet

Dear Amazon

I bought a toilet seat

Necessity not desire

I do not collect them

I'm not a toiletseat addict

No matter how temptingly you email me

I am not going to think 'Oh go on then
'
one more toilet seat I'll treat myself' 
 
Laughter

Sometimes with more consequence like in this other tweet

Had the same situation

with my mother's burial urn

Laughter

For months after her death

I got messages from Amazon saying 'If you liked that ' 

Laughter

Sometimes with worse consequences

Take an AI engine rejecting a student application for university

Why

Because it has learned on past data

characteristics of students that will pass and fail

Some are obvious like GPAs
GPA
But if in the past all students from a given postal code have failed

it is very likely that AI will make this a rule

and will reject every student with this postal code

not giving anyone the opportunity to prove the rule wrong

And no one can check all the rules

because advanced AI is constantly learning

And if humans are kept out of the room

there comes the algocratic nightmare

Who is accountable for rejecting the student

No one AI did

Is it fair Yes
 
The same set of objective rules has been applied to everyone

Could we reconsider for this bright kid with the wrong postal code

No algos don't change their mind

We have a choice here

Carry on with algocracy

or decide to go to Human plus AI

And to do this

we need to stop thinking tech first

and we need to start applying the secret formula

To deploy Human plus AI

 percent of the effort is to code algos
algos
 percent to build tech around the algos

collecting data building UI integrating into legacy systems
UI
But  percent the bulk of the effort

is about weaving together AI with people and processes

to maximize real outcome

AI fails when cutting short on the  percent
AI
The price tag for that can be small

wasting many many millions of dollars on useless technology

Anyone cares

Or real tragedies

 casualties in the recent crashes of two B aircrafts
B
when pilots could not interact properly

with a computerized command system

For a successful  percent

the first step is to make sure that algos are coded by data scientists
algos
and domain experts together

Take health care for example

One of our teams worked on a new drug with a slight problem

When taking their first dose

some patients very few have heart attacks

So all patients when taking their first dose

have to spend one day in hospital

for monitoring just in case

Our objective was to identify patients who were at zero risk of heart attacks

who could skip the day in hospital

We used AI to analyze data from clinical trials

to correlate ECG signal blood composition biomarkers
ECG
with the risk of heart attack

In one month

our model could flag  percent of patients at zero risk

They could skip the day in hospital

Would you be comfortable staying at home for your first dose

if the algo said so

Laughter

Doctors were not

What if we had false negatives

meaning people who are told by AI they can stay at home and die
AI
Laughter

There started our  percent

We worked with a team of doctors

to check the medical logic of each variable in our model

For instance we were using the concentration of a liver enzyme

as a predictor

for which the medical logic was not obvious

The statistical signal was quite strong

But what if it was a bias in our sample

That predictor was taken out of the model

We also took out predictors for which experts told us

they cannot be rigorously measured by doctors in real life

After four months

we had a model and a medical protocol

They both got approved

my medical authorities in the US last spring

resulting in far less stress for half of the patients

and better quality of life

And an expected upside on sales over  million for that drug

Seventy percent weaving AI with team and processes
AI
also means building powerful interfaces

for humans and AI to solve the most difficult problems together

Once we got challenged by a fashion retailer

We have the best buyers in the world

Could you build an AI engine that would beat them at forecasting sales

At telling how many highend lightgreen men XL shirts
XL
we need to buy for next year

At predicting better what will sell or not

than our designers

Our team trained a model in a few weeks on past sales data

and the competition was organized with human buyers

Result

AI wins reducing forecasting errors by  percent

Humanzero champions could have tried to implement this initial model

and create a fight with all human buyers

Have fun

But we knew that human buyers had insights on fashion trends

that could not be found in past data

There started our  percent

We went for a second test

where human buyers were reviewing quantities

suggested by AI
AI
and could correct them if needed

Result

Humans using AI 

lose

Seventyfive percent of the corrections made by a human

were reducing accuracy

Was it time to get rid of human buyers

No

It was time to recreate a model

where humans would not try to guess when AI is wrong

but where AI would take real input from human buyers

We fully rebuilt the model

and went away from our initial interface which was more or less

Hey human This is what I forecast
 
correct whatever you want

and moved to a much richer one more like

Hey humans

I don't know the trends for next year

Could you share with me your top creative bets

Hey humans

Could you help me quantify those few big items

I cannot find any good comparables in the past for them

Result

Human plus AI wins

reducing forecast errors by  percent

It took one year to finalize the tool

Long costly and difficult

But profits and benefits

were in excess of  million of savings per year for that retailer

Seventy percent on very sensitive topics

also means human have to decide what is right or wrong

and define rules for what AI can do or not

like setting caps on prices to prevent pricing engines

[from charging] outrageously high prices to uneducated customers
[]
who would accept them

Only humans can define those boundaries 

there is no way AI can find them in past data
AI
Some situations are in the gray zone

We worked with a health insurer

He developed an AI engine to identify among his clients

people who are just about to go to hospital

to sell them premium services

And the problem is

some prospects were called by the commercial team

while they did not know yet

they would have to go to hospital very soon

You are the CEO of this company

Do you stop that program

Not an easy question

And to tackle this question some companies are building teams

defining ethical rules and standards to help business and tech teams set limits

between personalization and manipulation

customization of offers and discrimination

targeting and intrusion

I am convinced that in every company

applying AI where it really matters has massive payback

Business leaders need to be bold

and select a few topics

and for each of them mobilize    people from their best teams 

tech AI data science ethics 

and go through the full   percent cycle

of Human plus AI

if they want to land AI effectively in their teams and processes

There is no other way

Citizens in developed economies already fear algocracy

Seven thousand were interviewed in a recent survey

More than  percent expressed real concerns

on the impact of AI on the workforce on privacy

on the risk of a dehumanized society

Pushing algocracy creates a real risk of severe backlash against AI

within companies or in society at large

Human plus AI is our only option

to bring the benefits of AI to the real world

And in the end

winning organizations will invest in human knowledge

not just AI and data

Recruiting training rewarding human experts

Data is said to be the new oil

but believe me human knowledge will make the difference

because it is the only derrick available

to pump the oil hidden in the data

Thank you

Many of us here use technology in our daytoday

And some of us rely on technology to do our jobs

For a while I thought of machines and the technologies that drive them

as perfect tools that could make my work more efficient and more productive

But with the rise of automation across so many different industries

it led me to wonder

If machines are starting to be able to do the work

traditionally done by humans

what will become of the human hand

How does our desire for perfection precision and automation

affect our ability to be creative

In my work as an artist and researcher I explore AI and robotics

to develop new processes for human creativity

For the past few years

I've made work alongside machines data and emerging technologies

It's part of a lifelong fascination

about the dynamics of individuals and systems

and all the messiness that that entails

It's how I'm exploring questions about where AI ends and we begin

and where I'm developing processes

that investigate potential sensory mixes of the future

I think it's where philosophy and technology intersect

Doing this work has taught me a few things

It's taught me how embracing imperfection

can actually teach us something about ourselves

It's taught me that exploring art

can actually help shape the technology that shapes us

And it's taught me that combining AI and robotics

with traditional forms of creativity  visual arts in my case 

can help us think a little bit more deeply

about what is human and what is the machine

And it's led me to the realization

that collaboration is the key to creating the space for both

as we move forward

It all started with a simple experiment with machines

called Drawing Operations Unit Generation 

I call the machine DOUG for short
DOUG 
Before I built DOUG

I didn't know anything about building robots

I took some opensource robotic arm designs

I hacked together a system where the robot would match my gestures

and follow [them] in real time
[]
The premise was simple

I would lead and it would follow

I would draw a line and it would mimic my line

So back in  there we were drawing for the first time

in front of a small audience in New York City

The process was pretty sparse 

no lights no sounds nothing to hide behind

Just my palms sweating and the robot's new servos heating up

Laughs Clearly we were not built for this

But something interesting happened something I didn't anticipate

See DOUG in its primitive form wasn't tracking my line perfectly
DOUG
While in the simulation that happened onscreen

it was pixelperfect

in physical reality it was a different story

It would slip and slide and punctuate and falter

and I would be forced to respond

There was nothing pristine about it

And yet somehow the mistakes made the work more interesting

The machine was interpreting my line but not perfectly

And I was forced to respond

We were adapting to each other in real time

And seeing this taught me a few things

It showed me that our mistakes actually made the work more interesting

And I realized that you know through the imperfection of the machine

our imperfections became what was beautiful about the interaction

And I was excited because it led me to the realization

that maybe part of the beauty of human and machine systems

is their shared inherent fallibility

For the second generation of DOUG
DOUG
I knew I wanted to explore this idea

But instead of an accident produced by pushing a robotic arm to its limits

I wanted to design a system that would respond to my drawings

in ways that I didn't expect

So I used a visual algorithm to extract visual information

from decades of my digital and analog drawings

I trained a neural net on these drawings

in order to generate recurring patterns in the work

that were then fed through custom software back into the machine

I painstakingly collected as many of my drawings as I could find 

finished works unfinished experiments and random sketches 

and tagged them for the AI system

And since I'm an artist I've been making work for over  years

Collecting that many drawings took months

it was a whole thing

And here's the thing about training AI systems

it's actually a lot of hard work

A lot of work goes on behind the scenes

But in doing the work I realized a little bit more

about how the architecture of an AI is constructed
AI
And I realized it's not just made of models and classifiers

for the neural network

But it's a fundamentally malleable and shapable system

one in which the human hand is always present

It's far from the omnipotent AI we've been told to believe in

So I collected these drawings for the neural net

And we realized something that wasn't previously possible

My robot DOUG became a realtime interactive reflection
DOUG 
of the work I'd done through the course of my life

The data was personal but the results were powerful

And I got really excited

because I started thinking maybe machines don't need to be just tools

but they can function as nonhuman collaborators

And even more than that

I thought maybe the future of human creativity

isn't in what it makes

but how it comes together to explore new ways of making

So if DOUG_ was the muscle
DOUG_
and DOUG_ was the brain
DOUG_
then I like to think of DOUG_ as the family
DOUG_
I knew I wanted to explore this idea of humannonhuman collaboration at scale

So over the past few months

I worked with my team to develop  custom robots

that could work with me as a collective

They would work as a group

and together we would collaborate with all of New York City

I was really inspired by Stanford researcher FeiFei Li

who said if we want to teach machines how to think

we need to first teach them how to see

It made me think of the past decade of my life in New York

and how I'd been all watched over by these surveillance cameras around the city

And I thought it would be really interesting

if I could use them to teach my robots to see

So with this project

I thought about the gaze of the machine

and I began to think about vision as multidimensional

as views from somewhere

We collected video

from publicly available camera feeds on the internet

of people walking on the sidewalks

cars and taxis on the road

all kinds of urban movement

We trained a vision algorithm on those feeds

based on a technique called optical flow

to analyze the collective density

direction dwell and velocity states of urban movement

Our system extracted those states from the feeds as positional data

and became pads for my robotic units to draw on

Instead of a collaboration of onetoone

we made a collaboration of manytomany

By combining the vision of human and machine in the city

we reimagined what a landscape painting could be

Throughout all of my experiments with DOUG
DOUG
no two performances have ever been the same

And through collaboration

we create something that neither of us could have done alone

we explore the boundaries of our creativity

human and nonhuman working in parallel

I think this is just the beginning

This year I've launched Scilicet
scilicet
my new lab exploring human and interhuman collaboration

We're really interested in the feedback loop

between individual artificial and ecological systems

We're connecting human and machine output

to biometrics and other kinds of environmental data

We're inviting anyone who's interested in the future of work systems

and interhuman collaboration

to explore with us

We know it's not just technologists that have to do this work

and that we all have a role to play

We believe that by teaching machines

how to do the work traditionally done by humans

we can explore and evolve our criteria

of what's made possible by the human hand

And part of that journey is embracing the imperfections

and recognizing the fallibility of both human and machine

in order to expand the potential of both

Today I'm still in pursuit of finding the beauty

in human and nonhuman creativity

In the future I have no idea what that will look like

but I'm pretty curious to find out

Thank you

Like a lot of people around the world

earlier this summer my friends and I were obsessed

with the Women's World Cup held in France

Here we are watching these incredible athletes

the goals were amazing the games were clean and engaging

and at the same time outside the field

these women are talking about equal pay

and in the case of some countries any pay at all for their sport

So because we were mildly obsessed we wanted to watch the games live

and we decided that one of the Spanishspeaking networks in the US

was the best place for us to start

And it wasn't until a few games into the tournament

that a friend of mine talks to me and says

Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing

is commercials for makeup and household cleaning products and diets

It did feel a little bit too obvious

and I don't know if we were sensitive about it

or the fact that we were watching with men and boys in our lives

but it did feel a little bit too obvious

that we're being targeted for being women

And to be honest there's nothing necessarily wrong with that

Someone sat down and looked at the tournament and said

Well this thing is likely to be seen by more women

these women are Hispanic because they're watching in Spanish

and this is women content

Therefore this is a great place for me to place all these commercials

that are femalecentric and maybe not other things

If I think about it as a marketer

I know that I absolutely should not be annoyed about it

because this is what marketers are tasked with doing

Marketers are tasked with building brands with very limited budget

so there's a little bit of an incentive

to categorize people in buckets

so they can reach their target faster

So if you think about this

it's kind of like a shortcut

They're using gender as a shortcut to get to their target consumer

The issue is that as logical as that argument seems

gender as a shortcut is actually not great

In this day and age if you still blindly use a gender view

for your marketing activities

actually it's just plain bad business

I'm not talking even about the backlash on stereotypes in advertising

which is a very real thing that has to be addressed

I'm saying it's bad business because you're leaving money on the table

for your brands and your products

Because gender is such an easy thing to find in the market

and to target and to talk about

it actually distracts you from the fun things

that could be driving growth from your brands

and at the same time

it continues to create separation around genders

and perpetuate stereotypes

So at the same time this activity is bad for your business

and bad for society so double whammy

And gender is one of those things like other demographics

that have historically been good marketing shortcuts

At some point however

we forgot that at the core we were targeting needs

around cooking and cleaning and personal care and driving and sports

and we just made it all a bucket

and we said Men and women are different

We got used to it and we never challenged it again

and it's fascinating to me

and by fascinating I mean a little bit insane

that we still talk about this as a segment

when it's most likely carryover bias

In fact I don't come to this conclusion lightly

We have enough data to suggest that gender is not the best place

to start for you to design and target your brands

And I would even go one step further

unless you are working in a very genderspecific product category

probably anything else

you're hypothesizing about your consumer right now

is going to be more useful than gender

We did not set up to draw this conclusion specifically

We found it

As consultants our job is to go with our clients

and understand their business

and try to help them find spaces for their brands to grow

And it is our belief that if you want to find disruptive growth in the market

you have to go to the consumer

and take a very agnostic view of the consumer

You have to go and look at them from scratch

remove yourself from biases and segments that you thought were important

just take a look to see where the growth is

And we built ourselves an algorithm precisely for that

So imagine that we have a person

and we know a person is making a choice

about a product or service

and from this person I can know their gender of course

other demographics where they live their income other things

I know the context where this person is making a decision

where they are who they're with

the energy anything

and I can also put other things in the mix

I can know their attitudes

how they feel about the category

their behaviors

So if you imagine this kind of blob of big data about a person 

I'm going to oversimplify the science here

but we basically built an algorithm for statistical tournaments

So a statistical tournament is like asking this big thing of data

So data from everything you know about consumers at this point

what is the most useful thing I need to know

that tells me more about what consumers need

So the tournament is going to have winners and losers

The winners are those variables those dimensions

that actually teach you a lot about your consumer

that if you know that you know what they need

And there's losing variables that are just not that practical

and this matters because in a world of limited resources

you don't want to waste it on people that actually have the same needs

So why treat them differently

So at this point I know suspense is not killing you

because I told you what the output is

but what we found over time

is after  projects around the world  this is covering  countries or more 

in essence we ran about a hundred thousand of these tournaments

and no surprise gender was very rarely the most predictive thing

to understand consumer needs

From a hundred thousand tournaments

gender only came out as the winning variable

in about five percent of them

This is true around the world by the way

We did this in places where traditional gender roles

are a little more pronounced

and the conclusions were exactly the same

It was a little bit more important gender than five percent

but not material

So let's let that sink in for a second

No matter how you're looking at a consumer

most likely anything else is going to be more interesting to you than gender

There's probably something very important you need to know about them

and you're getting distracted because you're doing everything based on gender

And that's why I say you're leaving money on the table

Gender is easy It's easy to design advertising based on gender
 
it's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender

But at the end that's not where the exciting growth will come from

If you're a food company for example it's actually much more interesting to you

to know where people are eating who they are eating with

are they very nutritionally oriented

All of those things are actually significantly more powerful and useful

than knowing if a person is a man or a woman

And that matters of course

because then if you're putting your limited budget into action

then you're better off creating solutions for different occasions

than trying to target women versus young men

Another example is alcoholic beverages

Thirtyfive percent to  percent of consumption in alcoholic beverages

around the world actually happens with women

but you know women don't drink beer

Those are the things that we typically hear

But actually when a man and a woman are for the most part in the same location

the emotional and functional needs they have at that moment

are very similar

There's only one exception by the way

and the exceptions exist

where if you have a man and a woman

on a date

the man is trying to impress the woman

and the woman is trying to connect with the man

so there's going to be a little bit of tension

but that's important to know

We'll take a few dates

Financial institutions that's something where we've heard a lot

about the difference between men and women

but actually talking about men and women as different

is distracting you from the thing that is underneath

We made it so simple as women don't like to invest

women hate managing their money

men are great and aggressive and risktakers

but at the end it's not about men and women

It is actually a different narrative

It is about there are people that are excited and energized

and educated to manage their finances

versus people that are not

So if you change the conversation

from men and women to actually what's underneath

then probably you'll stop being so condescending to women

and you may start serving some men

that are actually shy about managing their finances

I'll leave one more example

If I go back to the women that were playing sport at the beginning

one of the fascinating things we found over different countries

exploring sportswear

that if a person is a competitive person

and they are in the moment of action

the needs are not different between a man and a woman

An athlete is an athlete

It doesn't matter for men and women it doesn't matter for old and young

you are an athlete

and in the moment of action and extreme competition

you need this gear to work for you

So these soccerplaying women have a lot in common with their counterparts

Out of the field it doesn't matter

Out of the field they may be into fashion into other things

but on the field the needs are not different

So these are just a few examples on categories where we found

that gender was not the best place to go

and actually the argument is

that at this point it's not even a feminist push

it's just we got used to it

We got used to using gender

and it's important for us to start finding ways

to measure other things about consumers

so that we don't revert back to gender

I am not nave

and I know there's still going to be appetite

and certain ease around using gender

but at least this warrants a conversation

In your business you have to inquire

is this really the best lens for me to grow

So if you are like me a person that is in business

that I am constantly worried about what is my role

in the broader societal discussions

if you're listening to your business and you hear things like

Oh my target are women my target are men

this goes to young girls young boys

when it's that gender conversation

unless you are working again

in a very specific genderspecific product category

take this as a warning sign

because if you keep having these conversations

you will keep perpetuating stereotypes of people

and making people think that men and women are different

But because this is business and we're running a business

and we want to grow it

at least kind of challenge your own instinct to use gender

because statistics say that you're probably not choosing the best variable

to target your product or service

Growth is not easy at all

What makes you think that growth is going to come

from going into market with such an outdated lens like gender

So let's stop doing what's easy and go for what's right

At this point it's not just for your business it's for society

Thank you

In almost all aspects of our lives

we have perfect information available instantaneously

My phone can tell me everything about my finances

where precisely I am on a map

and the best way to my next destination

all with a click of a button

But this availability of information and transparency

almost completely disappears when it comes to consumer products

If you go to the seafood counter at your local supermarket

you can probably choose between several different types of fish

But chances are they won't be able to tell you

who caught the fish where precisely it was caught

whether it is sustainable to catch it there

and how it got transported

And that holds true for almost everything we buy

Every can of soup

every piece of meat every Tshirt
T
We as humans right now

are destroying the only thing we really need to survive

our planet

And most of the horrible problems that we're facing today

like climate change

and modern slavery in supply chains

come down to decisions

Human decisions to produce something one way and not another

And that's how we as consumers

end up making decisions that harm the planet

or our fellow humans

By choosing the wrong products

But I refuse to believe that anybody here in this room

or frankly anybody on this planet

really wants to buy a product

that harms the planet or our fellow humans

if given the choice

But you see choice is a loaded word

Choice means there's another option

Choice means you can afford that option

But choice also means

you have enough information to make an informed decision

And that information nowadays simply just doesn't exist

Or at least it's really really hard to access

But I think this is about to change

Because we can use technology to solve this information problem

And many of the specific technologies that we need to do that

have become better and cheaper over the recent years

and are now ready to be used at scale

So over the past two years

my team and I have been working

with one of the world's largest conservation organizations WWF

and we've founded a company called OpenSC
OpenSC
where SC stands for supply chain
SC
And we believe that by using technology

we can help to create

transparency and traceability in supply chains

and through that help to completely revolutionize

the way that we buy and also produce products as humans

Now some of this is going to sound a little bit like science fiction

but it's already happening

Let me explain

So in order to solve this information problem

we need to do three things

verify trace and share

Verify specific sustainability

and ethical production claims

in a databased and automated way

Then trace those individual physical products

throughout their supply chains

and finally share that information with consumers

in a way that truly gives them a choice

and lets them make consumption decisions

that are more aligned with their values

I'm going to use a real product

and a supply chain where we've made all of this a reality already

a Patagonian toothfish

or Chilean sea bass as it's called in the US

Number one verify

Verify how something is produced

But not just by saying Trust me this is good

trust me we've done all the right things

but by producing evidence for that individual physical product

and the way it was produced

By producing evidence

for a specific sustainability or ethical production claim

So for example in the case of the fish

has this fish been caught in an area where there's enough of them

so that it's sustainable to catch it there

and not in a marine protected area

So what we're doing here

is we're taking almost realtime GPS data from the ship 
GPS
the ship that's fishing 

and that tells us where the ship is

and where it's going at what speed

And we can then combine that with other types of data

like for example how deep the sea floor is

And combining all of this information

our machinelearning algorithms can then verify in an automated way

whether the ship is only fishing where it's supposed to or not

And as sensors become cheaper

we can put them in more places

And that means we can capture more data

and combining that with advancements in data science

it means that we can now verify

specific sustainability and ethical production claims

in an automated realtime and ongoing manner

And that really lays the basis for this information revolution

So number two trace

Trace those individual physical products

so that we can truly say

that the claim that we've verified about a certain product

actually belongs to that individual product

that we as consumers have right in front of us

Because without that level of traceability

all that we've really verified in the first place

is that somebody somewhere at some point

caught a fish in a sustainable way

or didn't harm the employee when asking them to produce a Tshirt
T
or didn't use pesticides when growing a vegetable that didn't actually need it

Only if I give a product an identity from the start

and then trace it throughout the whole supply chain

can this claim and the value that's been created

by producing it in the right way

truly stay with it

Now I've talked about cheaper sensors

There are many other technological developments

that make all of this much more possible today than every before

For example the falling costs of tags

You give a product a name

a serial number an identity

the tag is its passport

What you can see here is a toothfish being caught

This is what's called a longline fishery

so the fish are coming up onto the boat on individual hooks

And as soon as the fish is on board

it is killed and then after that

we insert a small tag into the fish's flesh

And in that tag there is an RFID chip with a unique serial number
RFID
and that tag follows the fish throughout the whole supply chain

and makes it really easy to sense its presence

at any port on any truck or in any processing plant

But consumers can't really read RFID tags
RFID
And so when it comes to filleting and packaging the fish

we read the RFID tag and then remove it
RFID
And then we add a unique QR code to the packaging of the fish

And that QR code then points back to the same information

that we've verified about the fish in the first place

And so depending on the type of product that we're working with

we may use QR codes bar codes RFID tags
RFID
or other tag technologies

But there are also technologies

that are at the brink of largescale breakthrough

that make tags themselves obsolete

Like for example

analyzing a product for trace elements

that can then tell you quite accurately where it is actually from

Then there's blockchain

A decentralized technology can act as a catalyst for this revolution

Because it can help mitigate some of the trust issues

that are inherent to giving people information

and then asking them to change their consumption behavior

because of that information

And so we use blockchain technology

where it adds value to what we're doing

But importantly

we don't let the limitations that this technology still has today

like for example with regards to scaling

we don't let that stand in our way

And that brings us to the third point

Share

How to share the information that we've verified and tracked

about where a product is from how it was produced

and how it got to where it is

How to share this information

is really different from product to product

And different from where you buy it

You behave differently in those situations

You are stressed and timepoor in the supermarket

Or with short attention span over dinner

because your date is so cute

Or you are critical and inquisitive

when researching for a larger purchase online

And so for our fish

we've developed a digital experience

that works when buying the fish in a freezer in a fish specialty store

and that gives you all of the information about the fish and its journey

But we also worked with a restaurant

and developed a different digital experience

that only summarizes the key facts about the fish and its journey

and works better in a dinner setting

and hopefully there doesn't annoy your date too much

Now that brings us full circle

We've verified that the fish was caught

in an area where it's sustainable to do so

We've then traced it throughout the entire supply chain

to maintain its identity and all the information that's attached to it

And then we've shared that information with consumers

in a way that gives them a choice

and lets them make consumption decisions

that are more in line with their values

Now for this fish example this is already rolled out at scale

This season

the entire fleet of the world's largest toothfish fishing company

Austral Fisheries

is tagging every single fish that they catch

and that ends up in their premium branded Glacier  product

And you can already buy this fish

And with it you can have all of the information I talked about today

and much more

attached to each individual fish or portion of the fish that you may buy

But this is not a fish or seafood thing

We're working on many many different commodities and products

and their supply chains across the globe

From dairy to fruit and vegetables

to nonfood products made out of wood

As a consumer all of this may sound like a huge burden

because you don't have time to look at all of this information

every time you buy something

And I don't expect you to

because you'll have help with that

In the future we'll leave the decision of which specific product to buy

increasingly up to machines

An algorithm will know enough about you

to make those decisions for you so you don't have to

And maybe it will even do a better job at it

In a recent study  percent of those

buying a product through a virtual assistant

said that they on occasion

actually went with the top product recommendation

of that virtual assistant

rather than the specific product or brand

that they set out to buy in the first place

You just say you need toilet paper

it's then an algorithm that decides which brand price point

or whether you go with recycled or not

Well nowadays this is usually based on what you bought in the past

or whoever pays the most to the company behind the virtual assistant

But why shouldn't that be also based on your values

Knowing that you want to buy planetfriendly

and knowing whether and how much you're willing and able to pay for that

Now that will make it easy and seamless

but still based on granular effects and data

to choose the right products

Not by necessarily doing it yourself

but by asking an algorithm

that knows how much you care about this planet

Not by necessarily doing it yourself

but by asking an algorithm

that is never timepoor or distracted

or with short attention span because of the cute date

and that knows how much you care about this planet

and the people living on it

by asking that algorithm to look at all of that information for you

and to decide for you

If we have reliable and trustworthy information like that

and the right systems that make use of it

consumers will support those who are doing the right thing

by producing products in a sustainable and ethical way

They will support them every time

by choosing their goods over others

And that means that good producers and processors and retailers

will get rewarded

And bad actors will be forced to adjust their practices

or get out of business

And we need that

If we want to continue to live together on this beautiful planet

we really need it

Thank you

In February  my wife and I moved to Singapore

Exactly at the same time

Uber has announced it started operations in the country

Now my wife and I agree on a lot of things

but using Uber was definitely not one of them

While I was excited about the technology

and how maybe we don't need to own cars anymore

she felt that every Uber car is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers
Uber
And Sarah was not the only one

As the Ubers Airbnbs and Amazons of the world 
UberAirbnbsAmazon
what we call online marketplaces 

as they started expanding their presence

we have heard all of us countless policymakers

worried about how to deal with these new risks

of job destruction lower wages and tax leakage

We've also heard company leaders

worried about aggressive competition from global platforms

eating up their local businesses

And on the rational level of course I understand

After all this is basic supply and demand economics

If in any market you dramatically increase supply

you should expect prices profitability and growth to go down

for existing players

But in my personal experience

I've also seen the other side of the story

Where online marketplaces

like Gojek in Indonesia or Jumia in Africa
GojekJumia
have helped their business ecosystems and the communities around them

The positive side I have seen

demonstrated itself in a woman a taxi driver in Egypt

that now had the opportunity to work

without the harassment she faced in the taxi business

It demonstrated itself through a village in Kenya

that got an economic boost

because the nearby beautiful but completely unknown lake

is now becoming a national ecotourism spot

Online marketplaces will continue to grow

And they will transform the way we shop

the way we travel

and the way we transact with each other

So we really need to understand

where is the truth between those two stories

Should we expect more of the bright side

or more of the dark and worrying side

And is there a way to get the first without getting the second

I believe there is

As a strategy consultant I study businesses for a living

And as a mathematician at heart

I couldn't live with something and its opposite being equally true

So I went back to fundamentals and I asked the question

What do online marketplaces really do

What do they do

Well at their core

they're doing something very simple

They match sellers and buyers

That's it

For drivers and passengers

you get Uber Grab in Southeast Asia

or DiDi in China
Didi
For matching merchants and consumers

you get Amazon Alibaba or Jumia in Africa
Jumia
And for housing you get Airbnb
Airbnb
for fundraising you get Kickstarter 
Kickstarter
the list goes on

What all these examples have in common

is that they transition this basic functionality

of matching sellers and buyers

from the physical world to the digital world

And by doing so

they can find better matches

do it faster

and ultimately unlock more value for everyone

In fact online marketplaces' core benefit

is that they get us more from the same amount of effort

For example

if you're a taxi driver in San Francisco

and you decide to work  hours per day

then you're actually having a paying passenger in your car

for four hours out of the 

If you take the same car and put it on a platform like Uber

you can have paying passengers

for an additional one and a half hours

This is the same car becoming  percent more productive

And the same has been proven true for other online marketplaces

By design they create more value for the economy

Now we need to figure out who gets this additional value

You can give it to the drivers 

more passengers more income

You can give it to consumers if you reduce prices

Or you can decide that the platform gets to keep all of it

What usually happens is that all three of them

would somehow split it

But what about the rest of us

We can also be impacted

without being on either sides of this business

If my neighbor decides to rent his apartment on Airbnb
Airbnb
and we have more people coming in and out of the building

more noise than usual

then I'm getting an unpleasant side effect of this productivity magic

This is what economists would call a negative externality

The negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive

is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop

by as much as  percent in New York for example

This is the dark side

And this is what sparks street demonstrations

and sometimes sometimes even violence

I profoundly believe this is avoidable

And it became clearer to me

the more I have spent time in emerging markets

In fact during my time in Singapore

I spent half of any given week traveling in the region

between Malaysia Thailand Indonesia

and I became a user 

actually more of a fan 

of online marketplaces that were not that wellknown back then

But some of them made interesting strategic tradeoffs

that dramatically reduced their side effects

their externalities

Take Gojek for example
Gojek
They're basically Uber for motor bikes

They are one of the most liked online marketplaces in Indonesia

and this has a lot to do with the role they chose to play

Instead of picking a fight

with every other transportation option out there

they choose to gradually integrate them within their own platform

so that without leaving the Gojek app
Gojek
you can check the public transportation schedule

and choose to take a bus for a long distance

Then maybe a motorbike or a traditional taxi

that you can order and pay for from within the same app

If you look at Gojek today
Gojek
nine out of  previous motor taxi drivers

believe their quality of life has improved after joining the platform

And nine out of  consumers 

nine out of  

believe that Gojek has a positive impact on society in general
Gojek
Now this level of trust is what allowed Gojek to grow
Gojek
into what is today a super online marketplace for everything

from food to grocery

even massages and laundry pickups

It all came from a deliberate tradeoff

to be an orchestrator of a bigger ecosystem

where others also have their role to play

instead of a single winner a hero

that takes for himself what would at the end be a smaller pie

Another interesting example is Jumia
Jumia
Jumia is the equivalent of Amazon in Africa
Jumia
But they don't generate the same level of fear

in the smallbusiness community

And one of the reasons for that

is because they have decided to actively invest

in African entrepreneurs

to grow them into the digital age

Now keep in mind

Jumia is operating in countries with some of the lowest digital literacy
Jumia
and digital connectivity scores in the world

Now they could have dealt with that

the usual way through lobbying for reforms 

and they probably do that 

but they have also built Jumia University
Jumia
an elearning platform
Elearning
where merchants can come and learn basic digital and business skills

We have studied online marketplaces in Africa last year

And during that study we have met one of Jumia's merchants
Jumia
His name is Jomo

He was fired from his job in 

and at that time he decided he wanted to become his own boss

He wanted to be independent

He also wanted to never be fired again

So at that time

Jomo had no clue what a business is

So he needed to go through a series of trainings

to learn how to select products how to price them

and how to promote them online

Today Jomo has a employee online business
Jomo
And as of a few months ago

he just opened his very first brickandmortar shop

in the suburbs of Nairobi

Now through its university

Jumia has the potential of helping a huge number of Jomos
JumiaJomos
And we have estimated that together with other online marketplaces

on the continent

they can generate three million additional jobs by 

And they would do that either directly

or through their impact on the wider community

And sometimes

taking that wider impact into consideration

or forgetting about it

can make or break a platform

To illustrate that let's go back to Singapore

So when we decided with my wife to leave the country last year

Uber decided to do the same

At the same time

again we started to see that pattern

but maybe it's a coincidence

In reality Uber lost the ridehailing battle

to a Malaysianborn startup called Grab
Grab
Now interestingly

my wife didn't have the same level of concerns with Grab
Grab
because when Grab started it had a different name
Grab
It was called MyTeksi
MyTeksi
and as the name suggests it started as a platform for taxis

So when Grab started expanding the driver pool beyond taxis
Grab
it was seen as gradual and reasonable

They were also very careful while doing so

They thought of what kind of social safety net

they should bring to all drivers

So they put in place special insurance packages

and even financial education programs

Now compare that with what happened in London

in New York in Paris

where taxi drivers didn't feel that the platforms understood

they had to pay  euros for their license 

and mostly in loans

When you don't take that kind of social environmental information

into account

you get strong reactions

I'm not trying to argue that the tradeoffs

by either Grab or Jumia or Gojek are riskfree
JumiaGojek
Did they slow down growth at some point temporarily

Maybe

But look at them today

Gojek is worth  billion dollars
Gojek
Jumia is one of only three unicorns in the whole of Africa
Jumia
And Grab well they pushed out Uber

out of the whole region of Southeast Asia

And I also think these tradeoffs have nothing specific to emerging markets

Amazon or Uber or others can learn from them

and adapt them to their own realities

In the long run

this doesn't need to be a zerosum game

In the long run 

and this is maybe the Asian side of me speaking 

it pays to be patient

It pays to reconsider your goal and your priorities

in the light of a much bigger equation

that includes you and your users of course

but also it includes regulators

policymakers your communities

And I would argue above all

it includes the very businesses you are meant to disrupt

Thank you

Applause

Take a minute

and think of yourself as the leader of a country

And let's say one of your biggest priorities

is to provide your citizens with highquality healthcare

How would you go about it

Build more hospitals

Open more medical colleges

Invest in clinical innovation

But what if your country's health system was fundamentally broken

Whether it's doctor absenteeism

drug stockouts or poor quality of care

Where would you start then

I'm a management consultant

and for the last three years

I've been working on a project

to improve the public heath system of Rajasthan

a state in India

And during the course of the project

we actually discovered something profound

More doctors better facilities clinical innovation 

they are all important

But nothing changes without one key ingredient

Motivation

But motivation is a tricky thing

If you've led a team raised a child or tried to change a personal habit

you know that motivation doesn't just appear

Something has to change to make you care

And if there's one thing that all of us humans care about

it's an inherent desire to shine in front of society

So that's exactly what we did

We decided to focus on the citizen

the people who the system was supposed to serve in the first place

And today I'd like to tell you

how Rajasthan has transformed its public health system dramatically

by using the citizen to trigger motivation

Now Rajasthan is one of India's largest states

with a population of nearly  million

That's larger than the United Kingdom

But the similarities probably end there

In  when my team was called in

to start working with the public health system of Rajasthan

we found it in a state of crisis

For example the neonatal mortality rate 

that's the number of newborns who die before their first month birthday 

was  times higher than that of the UK

No wonder then that citizens were saying

Hey I don't want to go to a public health facility

In India if you wanted to see a doctor in a public health facility

you would go to a PHC or primary health center
PHC
And at least  patients are expected to go to a PHC every day
PHC
But in Rajasthan only one out of four PHCs
PHC
was seeing this minimum number of patients

In other words people had lost faith in the system

When we delved deeper

we realized that lack of accountability is at the core of it

Picture this

Sudha a dailywage earner
Sudha
realizes that her oneyearold daughter

is suffering from uncontrollable dysentery

So she decides to take the day off

That's a loss of about  rupees or five dollars

And she picks up her daughter in her arms

and walks for five kilometers to the government PHC
PHC
But the doctor isn't there

So she takes the next day off again

and comes back to the PHC
PHC
This time the doctor is there

but the pharmacist tells her

that the free drugs that she's entitled to have run out

because they forgot to reorder them on time

So now she rushes to the private medical center

and as she's rushing there

looking at her daughter's condition worsening with every passing hour

she can't help but wonder

if she should have gone to the private medical center

in the first place

and payed the  rupees for the consultation and drugs

No one is held accountable for this incredible failure of the system

Costing time money and heartache to Sudha
Sudha
And this is something that just had to be fixed

Now as all good consultants

we decided that datadriven reviews

had to be the answer to improve accountability

So we created these fancy performance dashboards

to help make the review meetings of the health department

much more effective

But nothing changed

Discussion after discussion

meeting after meeting

nothing changed

And that's when it struck me

You see public systems

have always been governed through internal mechanisms

like review meetings

And over time

their accountability to the citizen has been diluted

So why not bring the citizen back into the equation

perhaps by using the citizen promises

Couldn't that trigger motivation

We started with what I like to call the coffee shop strategy

You've probably seen one of these signs in a coffee shop

which says

If you don't get your receipt the coffee is free

Now the cashier has no option

but to give you a receipt each time

So we took this strategy and applied it to Rajasthan

We worked with the government

on a program to revive  PHCs across the state
PHCs
and we got them to paint very clear citizen promises along the wall

We assure you that you will have a doctor each time

We assure you that you will get your free drugs each time

We assure you

that you will get your free diagnostics each time

And finally we worked with elected representatives

to launch these revived PHCs
PHC
who shared the citizen promises with the community

with a lot of fanfare

Now the promise was out there in the open

Failure would be embarrassing

The system had to start delivering

And deliver it did

Doctor availability went up

medicines came on hand

and as a result

patient visits went up by  percent in less than a year

The public health system was getting back into business

But there was still a long distance to go

Change isn't that easy

An exasperated doctor once told me

I really want to transform the maternal health in my community

but I just don't have enough nurses

Now resources like nurses

are actually controlled by administrative officers

who the doctors report to

And while the doctors were now motivated

the administrative officers simply weren't motivated enough

to help the doctors

This is where the head of the public health department

Ms Veenu Gupta came up with a brilliant idea
Veenu Gupta
A monthly ranking of all districts

And this ranking would assess the performance of every district

on each major disease

and each major procedure

But here's the best part

We made the ranking go public

We put the ranking on the website

we put the ranking on social media

and before you knew it the media got involved

with newspaper articles on which districts were doing well

and which ones weren't

And we didn't just want the rankings

to impact the best and the worstperforming districts

We wanted the rankings to motivate every district

So we took inspiration from soccer leagues

and created a threetiered ranking system

whereby every quarter

if a district's performance were to decline

you could get relegated to the lower tier

But if the district's performance were to improve

you could get promoted to the premiere league

The rankings were a big success
It generated tremendous excitement

and districts began vying with each other to be known as exemplars

It's actually very simple if you think about it

If the performance data is only being reviewed by your manager

in internal settings

it simply isn't motivating enough

But if that data is out there

in the open for the community to see

that's a very different picture

That just unlocks a competitive spirit

which is inherent in each and every one of us

So now when you put these two together

the coffee shop strategy and public competition

you now had a public health system

which was significantly more motivated to improve citizen health

And now that you had a more motivated health system

it was actually a system that was now much more ready for support

Because now there is a pull for the support

whether it's resources data or skill building

Let me share an example

I was once at a district meeting in the district of Ajmer

This is one of the districts that had been rising rapidly

in the rankings

And there were a group of passionate doctors

who were discussing ideas on how to better support their teams

One of the doctors had upskilled health workers

to tackle the problem of nurse shortages

Another doctor was using WhatsApp in creative ways
WhatsApp
to share information and ideas with his frontline workers

For example

where are the children who are missing from immunization

And how do you convince the mothers

to actually bring their children for immunization

And because their teams were now significantly motivated

they were simply lapping up the support

because they wanted to perform better and better

Broken systems certainly need more resources and tools

But they won't drive much impact

if you don't first address the motivation challenge

Once the motivation tide begins to shift

that's when you get the real returns off resources and tools

But I still haven't answered a key question

What happened to the performance of Rajasthan's public health system

In  when our work began

the government of India and the World Bank

came out with a public health index

Rajasthan was ranked th out of  large states

But in 

when the next ranking came out

Rajasthan showed one of the highest improvements

among all large states in India

leapfrogging four positions

For example it showed one of the highest reductions

in neonatal mortality

with  additional newborn lives being saved every year

Typically public health transformations take a long time even decades

But this approach had delivered results

in two years

But here's the best part

There is actually nothing Rajasthanspecific about what we learned

In fact this approach of using the citizen to trigger motivation

is not even limited to public health systems

I sincerely believe that if there is any public system

in any country

that is in inertia

then we need to bring back the motivation

And a great way to trigger the motivation

is to increase transparency to the citizen

We can do this with education

and sanitation and even political representation

Government schools can compete publicly on the basis of student enrollment

Cities and towns on the basis of cleanliness

And politicians on the basis of a scorecard

of how exactly they're improving citizen lives

There are many broken systems out there in the world

We need to bring back their motivation

The citizen is waiting

We must act today

Thank you very much

In Maori My mountain is Taupiri

Waikato is my river

My name is Marilyn

Hello

As you've heard when I was very young

I was elected to the New Zealand Parliament

And at that age you learn mostly by listening to others' stories

I remember a woman who'd been injured in a farm accident

and it was coming up to shearing time

on the farm

and she had to be replaced by a shepherd

by a rousie in the woolshed

and of course there was still someone needed to manage the household

and to prepare the food for the shearing gangs

And her mother came to help with that

But the family got no compensation for the mother

because that's what mothers and family members are supposed to do

One year a company called Gold Mines New Zealand

applied for a prospecting license on our beautiful Mt Pirongia
 
It is a mountain

full of extraordinary ecosystems

of verdant virgin native forests

It produced oxygen it was a carbon sink

it was a home for endangered species and for pollinating species

in the farmland around

And the mining company put up this great economic prospectus

that was about how much money could be made

from mining our mountain

about all the growth and development

that would show in New Zealand's budgetary forecasts

and we were just left with the language

of all that we valued about our mountain

Fortunately we stopped

And then I remembered

a woman who had three children under five

who was caring for her elderly parents

and nobody seemed to think that at some stage

she might actually need some assistance with childcare

because she wasn't in the paid workforce

And there began to be a pattern in all of these stories I was being told

And I started to ask enough questions

to try and track to the core of this pattern of values

that was part of all of these stories

And I found it

in an economic formula called the gross domestic product

or the GDP
GDP
Most of you will have heard of it

Many of you won't have any idea what it actually means

The rules were drawn up by Westerneducated men in 

They established a boundary of production

in drawing up these rules

What they were keen to measure

was everything that involved a market transaction

So on one side of the boundary

everything where there was a market exchange was counted

It doesn't matter whether the exchange is legal or illegal

Market exchange in the illegal trade in armaments [munitions]
[]
drugs endangered species

trafficking of people 

all of this is great for growth

and it all counts

On the other side of the boundary of production

there was this extraordinary phrase in the rules

that the work done by the people they called nonprimary producers

was of little or no value

So I thought let's see how many nonprimary producers we have here today

So in the last week or so

how many of you have transported members of your household or their goods

without payment

How many of you have done a bit of cleaning a bit of vacuuming

a bit of sweeping a bit of tidying up the kitchen

Yeah

How about going shopping for members of the household

Preparing food Cleaning up afterwards
 
Laundry Ironing
 
Laughter

Well as far as economics is concerned

you were at leisure

Laughter

Applause and cheers

Now how about the women

who have been pregnant and who have had children

Yes

Now I really hate to tell you this

because it might well have been hard labor

but at that moment you were unproductive

Laughter

And some of you may have breastfed your infant

Now in the New Zealand national accounts 

that's what the figures are called that's where we get the GDP 
GDP
in the New Zealand national accounts

the milk of buffalo goats sheep and cows

is of value

but not human breast milk

Laughter

It is the very best food on the planet

It is the very best investment that we can make in the future health

and education of that child

It doesn't count at all

All of those activities are on the wrong side of the production boundary

And something that's very important to know

about this accounting framework

they call it accounts

but there's no debit side

We just keep market exchanges going

and it's all good for growth

We're in Christchurch

where people have lived through a devastating natural disaster

and recovered

And ever since that time

New Zealand has been told

our growth figures are great because we're rebuilding Christchurch

Nothing was ever lost

from the national accounting framework

because of the loss of lives

the loss of land

the loss of buildings

the loss of special spaces

Now it might also be becoming obvious to you

that this boundary of production works in terms of our environment

When we're mining it

when we're deforesting

when we're deleting our environment

when we're fishing out our marine resources

legal or illegal

as long as market is exchanged it's all good for growth

To leave our natural environment alone

to sustain it to protect it

is apparently worth nothing

Now how and what can we do about this

Well I wrote first about it  years ago

Then in  after the global financial crisis

President Sarkozy of France

asked three men who had all won Nobel Prizes in Economics 

Sen Fitoussi and Stiglitz 
SenFitoussiStiglitz
to discover what I'd written about

 years ago

Laughter

Applause

Relying on per capita GDP relying on these growth figures they said
GDP
doesn't appear to be the best way to proceed

to make public policy

And I totally agree with them

Laughter

One of the things that you notice about these rules 

they are revised  they were revised   
 
is that the revisions are mostly done by statisticians

and the statisticians do know what is wrong with the data

but hardly any of the economists ever stop to ask that same question

So in 

the GDP is in even worse shape
GDP
You see to measure GDP
GDP
you have to assume that some kind of production

or service delivery or consumption

occurs inside a nationstate

and you know where that is

But trillions of dollars are circling the globe

in minipart from our Googles our Facebooks our Twitters

siphoned through a number of tax shelters

so that when we click on our computer

and go to download some software

we don't know where it was produced

and frankly no one knows where we are as we're consuming it either

These taxfree havens

distort the GDP to such an extent
GDP
that about three years ago

Europe looked askance at Ireland

and said We don't think you're reporting correctly

and in the next year their GDP went up  percent
GDP
Now all that work that you're doing

when you were at leisure and unproductive

we can measure this

and we can measure this in time use surveys

When we look at the amount of time that's taken

in the unpaid sector

what we find is that in almost every country where I've ever seen the data

it is the single largest sector of the nation's economy

In the last three years for example

the UK statistician has declared

that all of that unpaid work is the equivalent of all manufacturing

and all retailing in the UK

In Australia

the single largest sector of Australia's economy is unpaid childcare

and the secondlargest sector is all the rest of the unpaid work

before banking and insurance and financial intermediation services

clock in at the largest part of the market sector

Just last year the Premier of the Victoria state of Australia

declared that half of that state's GDP
GDP
was in fact the value of all the unpaid work

Now as a policy maker

you cannot make good policy

if the single largest sector of your nation's economy

is not visible

You can't presume to know where the needs are

You can't locate time poverty

You can't address the most critical issues of need

So what can go in the place of GDP
GDP
Well GDP has got many other problems OK
GDP
We don't behave in a way that assists GDP
GDP
Large numbers of people around the planet

are now using household assets  their cars their homes themselves 

for Uber for Airbnb
UberAirbnb
And no we're not supposed to use assets from the unpaid sector

to make money in the market sector

This is confusing

Laughter

And very difficult to measure

So economists don't want to know

what's wrong with their most important GDP
GDP
and I think they've got so many problems they can just move off to a quiet corner

and continue to publish that

and not come anywhere near the rest of us

with this talk of capitals

and natural assets

and other ways in which to colonize the rest of our lives

I think time use is the most important indicator going forward

Every one of us has exactly the same amount of it

If there are going to be critical issues as we move forward

we need a solid database

because whatever we change away from the GDP
GDP
we're going to be stuck with it for about  years

and we need something that's solid and immutable

and that everybody understands

because if I put time use data in front of you

you'll immediately start nodding

You'll immediately start recognizing what it means

And honestly

if I put the GDP data in front of you
GDP
a lot of you would prefer to leave for morning tea

Laughter

We also need to be looking at the quality of our environment

As every year goes past we get much better

at measuring the devastation of it

of measuring how little we protect anymore

And yet with climate change

we don't all have to be scientists to see to feel to know

what is happening to our beautiful planet

We need in this country

the paramountcy of what we can learn from kaitiakitanga
kaitiakitanga
from whanaungatanaga
whanaungatanaga
from what Maori who have been here for centuries can teach us

When you're in parliament

and you're not in an economist's frame of mind

you make decisions across a range of data

You look at the tradeoffs

You think deeply about implications

way beyond whether or not GDP is up or down
GDP
Economists want to turn everything into a monetary exchange

even time use data

so that they can carry on trying to decide

whether GDP is up or down
GDP
That's not a great way to go

And others have said to me

Marilyn why don't you just work on a system

that includes all the unpaid work

and the pregnancy and the birth and the lactation

in the GDP
GDP
There's a very important moral and ethical answer to that

and it is that I do not want the most valuable things on earth

the things I treasure

sitting in an accounting framework that thinks that war is great for growth

Applause and cheers

So from now on

whenever you listen to the news

you're not going to go blank when they say GDP
GDP
You're going to think

I know what they're talking about and it's not good

Laughter

I know that there are alternatives

and I'm going to spend my time correcting people

talking to them about this value base

and talking to them about what the alternatives can be

because humankind

and our planet

need another way

Thank you

Applause and cheers

I'm a biological oceanographer

I have the absolute privilege of studying microbial lives

in the Pacific Ocean

So we'll talk about microbes in a minute

but I first want to give you a sense of place

a sense of scale

The Pacific Ocean is our largest deepest ocean basin

It covers  million square miles

If you took all the continents and you put them together

in a little Pangaea 
Pangaea 
they'd fit snug inside the Pacific with room to spare

It's a massive ecosystem

from the blues of the open ocean to the green of the continental margins

In this place

I get to study the base of the food web

plankton

Now in my research

and really in the field of microbial oceanography as a whole

there's a theme that has emerged

and that theme is change

These microbial ecosystems are changing in real and measurable ways

and it is not that hard to see it

Oceans cover  percent of our planet

so ocean change is planetary change

and it all starts with microbes

Now I have two vignettes to share with you

and these are meant to be love stories to microbes

But I'll be honest that there's an aspect of it

that's just a total bummer

and beware focus on the love

Right That's where I'm coming from
 
So the first thing to know

is that the forests of the sea are microbial

And what I mean by that is that by and large

plants in the open ocean are microscopic

and they are much more abundant than we realize

So I'm going to show you some mug shots of these organisms

that I've collected over the years

These are the lowest rungs of the ocean food web

These are tiny plants and animals

that come in a variety of shapes and sizes and colors and metabolisms

There are hundreds of thousands in a single milliliter of seawater

You are definitely swimming with them when you're in the ocean

They produce oxygen they consume CO

and they form the base of the food web

on which every other form of ocean life is reliant

Now I've spent about  days of my scientific life at sea

and a lot more in front of a computer or in the lab

so I feel compelled to tell you some of their stories

Let's start in the Pacific Northwest

This place is green It is beautiful
 
These are blooms of phytoplankton that you can see from space

along the West Coast of the United States

It's an incredibly productive ecosystem

This is where you go to salmon fish halibut fish whale watch

It's a beautiful part of our country

And here for  years among other things

I studied the uplifting topic of harmful algal blooms

These are blooms of toxinproducing phytoplankton

that can contaminate food webs and accumulate in shellfish and fish

that are harvested for human consumption

We were trying to understand why they bloom where they bloom

when they bloom

so we could manage these harvests

and protect human health

Now the problem is the ocean's a moving target

and much like some people in our lives toxicity varies among the plankton

Laughter

Alright

So to get around these challenges

we combined satellite remote sensing

with drones and gliders

regular sampling of the surf zone

and a lot of time at sea

in small boats off the Oregon coast

And I don't know if many of you have had the opportunity to do that

but it is not easy

[Even oceanographers get seasick]
[]
Here's some poor students

Laughter

I've hidden their faces to protect their identities

Laughter

This is a challenging place

So this is hardwon data I'm about to talk about OK

Laughter

So by combining all of our data with our collaborators

we had year time series of toxins and phytoplankton cell counts

And that allowed us to understand the patterns of these blooms

and to build models to predict them

And what we found

was that the risk of harmful algal blooms was tightly linked to aspects of climate

Now when I say climate I don't mean weather daytoday

I mean longterm changes

These oscillations that you may have heard of 

the Pacific Decadal Oscillation El Nio 
El Ni  o
they usually bring warm dry winters to this region

but they also reduce the strength of the California Current

which runs from the north to the south along the Pacific Northwest

and they warm the coastal ocean

These are the reds you're seeing in this plot

warm anomalies

strong positive indices of the PDO
PDO
And when we have these changes in circulation

and changes in temperature

the risk of harmful algal blooms is increased

but also salmon recruitment has decreased

and we see intrusions of invasive species like green crab

So these are ecological and economic impacts of climate

Now if our models are right

the frequency and severity of these events are only going to get worse

right along with these warm anomalies

And to illustrate that

 was probably one of the worst harmful algal blooms in Oregon history

It was also the hottest year in the modern climate record at that time

that is until 



 

In fact the five hottest years in the modern climate record

have been the last five

That bodes really well for harmful algal blooms

and poorly for ecosystem health

Now you may not care about shellfish

but these changes impact economically important fisheries

like crab and salmon

and they can impact the health of marine mammals like whales

And that might matter a little bit more

That might resonate

So there's your doomsday tale for the margins of the Pacific

Actually these are really resilient ecosystems

They can absolutely bounce back if we give them a chance

The point is not to ignore the changes that we're seeing

which brings me to my second vignette

I have since moved to the most remote island chain on our planet

the Hawaiian Islands

where I'm the new lead of a program called the Hawaiian Ocean Timeseries

And this is a program that for  years

has made this monthly pilgrimage to a spot called Station ALOHA

It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

in the center of this vast swirling system of currents

that we call the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre

It's our largest ocean ecosystem

It's four times the size of the Amazon rain forest

It is warm in a good way

It is blue water

it's absolutely the type of place you want to dive in and swim

You cannot do that off of research boats

because you know sharks Google it
 
Laughter

This is a beautiful place

And here since October of 

generations of researchers have made these monthly pilgrimages

We study the biology the chemistry the physics of the open ocean

We've measured the temperature from the surface to the seafloor

We've tracked the currents traced the waves

People have discovered new organisms here

People have created vast genomic libraries

that have revolutionized

what we think about the diversity of marine microorganisms

It's not just a place of discovery

but the important part about time series

are that they provide us a sense of history

a sense of context

And in  years of data

it's allowed us to separate the seasonal change

and see the emergence of humanity's fingerprints

on the natural world

There's another iconic time series in Hawaii

and that is the Keeling Curve
Keeling
I hope you have all seen this

This time series has documented the rapid increase in carbon dioxide

in the atmosphere

It's not just the number it's the rate of increase

The rate of carbon dioxide increase in our atmosphere

is unprecedented for our planet

And that has consequences for our oceans

In fact oceans absorb about  percent of the heat that's generated

by greenhouse gas emissions

and about  percent of the carbon dioxide

And we have been able to measure that at Station ALOHA

Each one of these dots is a cruise

It represents people's lives over  years trying to make these measurements

and it took  years to be able to see this

CO rises in the atmosphere

CO rises in the ocean

That's the red line

A consequence of that

is a fundamental change in the chemistry of seawater

a decline in pH 
PH
pH is on a log scale
PH
here's your blue line

So we've seen a  percent decline in pH in the surface ocean
pH
in this time series

Now that has impacts for organisms that need to feed build shells

that changes growth rates metabolic interactions

and it doesn't just impact plankton 

it impacts ecosystems as large as coral reefs

Now one of the things we've been able to show in this time series

is this is just skimming the surface

Increases in CO and a decline in pH
pH
are measured over the top  meters of the water column

I really find that to be profound

This is genuinely one of the most remote places on our planet

and we've impacted the top  meters of the water column

Now these two things 

harmful algal blooms ocean acidification 

that's not all of course

You've heard of the rest

sealevel rise eutrophication melting of the polar ice caps

expansion of oxygen minimum zones pollution loss of biodiversity

overfishing

It's hard for me to get a grad student 

you can see this pitch is a difficult one right

Laughter

Sighs

Again I think these systems these microbial ecosystems

are immensely resilient

We just cannot go too far down this path

I personally believe that sustained observation of our oceans and our planet

is the moral imperative for our generation of scientists

We are bearing witness

to the changes that are being inflicted upon our natural communities

and by doing so

it provides us the opportunity to adapt and enact global change

if we're willing

So the solutions to these problems are multitiered

It involves a portfolio of solutions

local change

but all the way up to voting for people who will protect our environment

on a global scale

Applause

Let's bring it back to the love

Laughter

Microbes matter

These organisms are small

abundant ancient

and they are critical to sustaining our population and our planet

Yet we are on track to double our carbon dioxide emissions

in the next  years

so the analogy that I use for that

is like we are eating like we're still in our s

assuming there will be no consequences 

but I'm a woman in her s

I know there are consequences for my fuel consumption Right
 
Laughter

These oceans are very much alive

These ecosystems have not collapsed

Well except for the Arctic we can talk about that

Laughter

But the sustained observations that I've shared with you today

the work of generations of scientists

are pointing us to take better care of our oceans

and to nurture the microbes that sustain us

And on that note

I want to end with a quote from one of my heroes

Jane Lubchenco

And this slide is appropriate

Jane has said that the oceans are not too big to fail

nor are they too big to fix

but the oceans are too big to ignore

Thank you

Applause

In the rather delightful book The Little Prince

there is a quotation which says

It's only with the heart that one can see rightly

What is essential is invisible

And while the author wrote these words sitting in a comfortable chair

somewhere in the United States

I learned this very same lesson

miles away in a filthy dirty barrack

in an extermination camp in Poland

It isn't the value or the size of a gift that truly matters

it is how you hold it in your heart

When I was six years old

my mother my father my sister and myself

left Jewhating Germany and we went to Yugoslavia

And we were in Yugoslavia for seven happy years

and then Germany invaded Yugoslavia

and we suddenly were persecuted again

and I had to go into hiding

And I was hiding for roughly two years

with a couple who had worked for the resistance movement

And I developed films and I made enlargements

One day when I was  years old

I was arrested by the gestapo

and beaten up

and for two months dragged through various prisons

and eventually I ended up

in a yearold fortress in Czechoslovakia

which the Nazis had converted into a concentration camp

I was there for  months

I laid railroad tracks

I exterminated vermin

I made baskets

and after  months

about  of us were loaded into cattle cars

the doors were closed and we were shipped east

For three days we traveled like that

and when we were unloaded

we were smelling of urine and of feces

and we found ourselves in the Auschwitz extermination camp

A camp that by that time

had murdered already over one million people

and sent them through the chimney into the sky

We arrived we were stripped of all of our properties

whatever we had

and were given striped uniforms

were given a tattoo on our arms

and we also were given the message

that we would be there for exactly six months

And after that we would leave the camp

Through the chimney

We were assigned to different barracks

And the barracks were filled with wooden bunks

six people on each level

three people sleeping in one direction and three in the other direction

so whichever way you slept

you always had a pair of feet in your face

The man next to me was an extremely nice gentleman

and he introduced himself as Mr Herbert Levine

Mr Levine was kind and polite to me

One day when I came back from a work assignment

I climbed up

I was at the top level of the threetier bunk

and there was Mr Levine with a deck of cards

And he was shuffling these cards

And I couldn't understand it you know

having a deck of cards in Auschwitz

was like finding a gorilla in your bathroom

Laughter

You know What is he doing there

And then Mr Levine turned to me

and offered me the deck and said Pick a card

So I picked a card

and he performed a card trick for me

He performed a miracle

And I'd never seen a card trick before

and the man who performed it was sitting right there

And then Mr Levine did the unthinkable

He actually explained the trick to me

And the words got burned into my brain

And I remembered every single word

and from that day on

I practiced that trick every day

Although I didn't have any cards

I just kept on practicing

About three weeks later

the entire camp with the exception of a couple hundred of us

were sent to the gas chambers

I was sent to another camp where I worked in the stables

and then in January 

when the Russians advanced

 of us were sent on a death march

And we walked for three days on and off

and in the middle of the winter

and by the time we arrived at a railroad siding

out of the  people

 had died
 
And the rest of us were loaded into open railroad cars

and for four days shipped all the way from Poland down to Austria

And we found ourselves in a death camp

in a concentration camp called Mauthausen

which again was built like a fortress

And at that point the SS abandoned us

and there was no food there

and there were thousands and thousands of bodies there

I slept for three days next to a dead man

just to get his ration of a tablespoon of moldy bread

And two days before the end of the war May 

we were liberated by American forces

At that time I was  years old

and I weighed  pounds

And I hitchhiked back to Yugoslavia

And when I came back to Yugoslavia

there was communism there

there was no family there

and there were no friends there

I stayed there for two years

and after two years I managed to escape to England

And when I came to England

I couldn't speak English

I had no education I had no skills

I started working

and about a year after I arrived in England

I bought myself a deck of cards

And for the very first time

I actually performed the trick

that was shown to me in Auschwitz on top of a bunk bed

And it worked

It worked beautifully

And I showed it to some friends of mine

and they loved it

And I went to a magic store and I bought some magic tricks

and I showed them to my friends

and I bought some more magic tricks

and I showed it to them

And then I bought some magic books and I bought some more magic books

There's a very very thin line

between a hobby and insanity

Laughter

Anyway I got married

and I came to the United States

and one of the first jobs that I had

demanded from me to speak to small groups of people

And I managed it I was very good at it

And then  years ago I retired

And I started speaking in schools

And the only reason why I could speak in schools

is because a very friendly man

showed a rather scared kid a card trick

in a concentration camp

This man who showed it to me Mr Levine

had been a professional magician

He worked in Germany

and when he came to Auschwitz the SS knew who he was

so they gave him some cards

they gave him a piece of string

they gave him some dice

and he performed for them

And then he also taught some of them

He survived the war

but his wife and his son died

He came to the United States and performed in various venues

but I never met him again

But the trick that he showed me stayed with me

and enabled me to go around schools

and try to make this world just a little bit better

So if you ever know somebody who needs help

if you know somebody who is scared

be kind to them

Give them advice

give them a hug

teach them a card trick

Whatever you are going to do

it's going to be hope for them

And if you do it at the right time

it will enter their heart

and it will be with them wherever they go forever

Thank you

And I'd like to discuss a new type of medicine

It's made from a molecule called a constrained peptide

There are only a few constrained peptide drugs available today

but there are a lot that will hit the market in the coming decade

Let's explore what these new medicines are made of

how they're different and what's causing this incoming tidal wave

of new and exciting medicines

Constrained peptides are very small proteins

They've got extra chemical bonds that constrain the shape of the molecule

and this makes them incredibly stable

as well as highly potent

They're naturally occurring our bodies actually produce a few of these

that help us to combat bacterial fungal and viral infections

And animals like snakes and scorpions

use constrained peptides in their venom

Drugs that are made of protein are called biologic drugs

So this includes constrained peptides

as well as medicines like insulin

or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel
HumiraEnbrel
And in general biologics are great

because they avoid several ways that drugs can cause side effects

First protein

It's a totally natural nontoxic material in our bodies

Our cells produce tens of thousands of different proteins

and basically all of our food has protein in it

And second sometimes drugs interact with molecules in your body

that you don't want them to

Compared to small molecule drugs

and by this I mean regular drugs like aspirin

biologics are quite large

Molecules interact when they adopt shapes that fit together perfectly

Much like a lock and key

Well a larger key has more grooves

so it's more likely to fit into a single lock

But most biologics also have a flaw

They're fragile

So they're usually administered by injection

because our stomach acid would destroy the medicine

if we tried to swallow it

Constrained peptides are the opposite

They're really durable like regular drugs

So it's possible to administer them using pills inhalers ointments

This is what makes constrained peptides so desirable for drug development

They combine some of the best features

of smallmolecule and biologic drugs into one

But unfortunately it's incredibly difficult

to reengineer the constrained peptides that we find in nature

to become new drugs

So this is where I come in

Creating a new drug is a lot like crafting a key

to fit a particular lock

We need to get the shape just right

But if we change the shape of a constrained peptide by too much

those extra chemical bonds are unable to form

and the whole molecule falls apart

So we needed to figure out how to gain control over their shape

I was part of a collaborative scientific effort

that spanned a dozen institutions across three continents

that came together and solved this problem

We took a radically different approach from previous efforts

Instead of making changes to the constrained peptides

that we find in nature

we figured out how to build new ones totally from scratch

To help us do this

we developed freely available opensource peptidedesign software

that anyone can use to do this too

To test our method out

we generated a series of constrained peptides

that have a wide variety of different shapes

Many of these had never been seen in nature before

Then we went into the laboratory and produced these peptides

Next we determined their molecular structures

using experiments

When we compared our designed models

with the real molecular structures

we found that our software can position individual atoms

with an accuracy that's at the limit of what's possible to measure

Three years ago this couldn't be done

But today we have the ability to create designer peptides

with shapes that are customtailored for drug development

So where is this technology taking us

Well recently

my colleagues and I designed constrained peptides

that neutralize influenza virus

protect against botulism poisoning

and block cancer cells from growing

Some of these new drugs

have been tested in preclinical trials with laboratory animals

And so far they're all safe and highly effective

Constrained peptide design is a cuttingedge technology

and the drug development pipeline is slow and cautious

So we're still three to five years out from human trials

But during that time

more constrained peptide drugs

are going to be entering the drug development pipeline

And ultimately I believe that designed peptide drugs

are going to enable us all to break free

from the constraints of our diseases

Thank you

How did you discover your passion

or find your career

Were you exposed to it

Or was it trial and error

As child rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman said
Marian Wright Edelman
You can't be what you can't see

Fortunately we now live in a time

when emerging technologies may help us to solve this problem

For the past two years

I've been developing an extended reality program

that enables middle school students from across the country

to take on the role of a marine biologist 

even if they've never seen the ocean

As one seventh grader who recently completed our program said

I could see myself as a scientist

because I enjoyed this game

This feedback really excited me

because too few students do see themselves as scientists

A  study showed that  percent of eighth and ninthgrade students

said Science isn't me

Coincidentally also in 

I met Mand Holford a marine biochemist

and Lindsay Portnoy an educational psychologist
Lindsay Portnoy
The three of us shared a passion

for getting students excited by and comfortable with science

We thought about how we could give children

the most realistic experience of a scientific career

We discussed the research

it showed that students felt comfortable taking risks when playing games

So the three of us started an educational games company

to bring science to life

Virtual reality seemed like a lowcost way of increasing access

In addition academic research has shown

that virtual reality may lead to increases in learning retention

This was perfect for us as we wanted to be in schools

so that we could reach the most number of students possible

particularly students who have been underrepresented in science

So with funding from the National Science Foundation

we began developing our extended reality program

that combined virtual reality

with personalized digital journaling

We worked with teachers while developing it

to ensure that it would fit seamlessly into existing curricula

and empower teachers to use cuttingedge technology in their classroom

We designed the virtual reality for Google Cardboard
Google Cardboard
which requires only a smartphone

and a  dollar VR viewer made of cardboard
VR
With this inexpensive headset

students are transported to an underwater expedition

Students use their digital journal

to write down their notes

to answer questions

to construct models

and to develop hypotheses

Students then go to the virtual world to test their hypotheses

and see if they're accurate

much as scientists go to the field

in their careers

When students return to their digital journal

they share their observations claims

reasoning and evidence

The students' written answers and virtual interactions

are all updated live

in an educator assessment dashboard

so that teachers can follow their progress

and support them as needed

To give you a better sense I'm going to show you

a little bit of what students see

This is the virtual reality when they're underwater

observing the flora and fauna

This is the digital journal where they're constructing their models

based on this abiotic data to show what they expect to see

Here they're supporting that with qualitative statements

And this is the educator dashboard that shows progress

and enables [teachers] to see the students' answers as they go
[]
When we were creating BioDive

again we really wanted to focus on access

so we designed it to require only one phone for every four students

We also knew how collaborative science work is

so we constructed the experience to only be solved

through collaborative teamwork

as each student is an expert in a different geographic location

Given that these children's brains are still developing

we limited each experience to last a maximum of two minutes

And finally because we know the importance of repeated exposure

for internalizing knowledge

we constructed BioDive to take place over five class periods
Biodive
We started piloting BioDive in 

in  schools in New York and New Jersey

We wanted to see students as they were using this new technology

In  now

we are now piloting in  states

What we have heard from teachers who have taught our program

It was a nice way to show ocean dynamics without the luxury of actually being there

since we are in Ohio

Laughter

It's pretty mindblowing

The students were totally engaged

But what really gives us hope is what we're hearing from students

I liked how it felt like I was there

It's interactive and a fun way to learn

It really gave me realistic examples of how these organisms appear

I could see myself as a scientist because it seems really fun

Our feedback wasn't always so positive

When we began developing

we started off by asking students

what they liked

what they didn't like

and what they found confusing

Eventually we began asking what they wished they could do

Their feedback gave us concrete items to build in

to be sure that we were including student voices in what we were designing

Overall what we have learned is that this is the beginning of a new platform

for giving students both voice and ownership

in deciding how they want to have impact

in their careers

We focused on science

because we know we need scientists

to help us solve our current and future challenges

But virtual reality could support students in any area

How could we support students in exploring all of their desires

with these eyeopening experiences and chances to learn from primary sources

Could we create VR for inexpensive headsets
VR
that lets them be immersed in oral literature

or in critical moments of human history

Extended reality has the potential to change the trajectory

of our children's lives

and lead them to careers they never imagined

by giving them the chance to see what they can be

Thank you

Mark Miskin This is a rotifer

It's a microorganism about a hair's width in size

They live everywhere on earth  saltwater freshwater everywhere 

and this one is out looking for food

I remember the first time I saw this thing

I was like eight years old and it completely blew me away

I mean here is this incredible little creature

it's hunting swimming

going about its life

but its whole universe fits within a drop of pond water

Paul McEuen So this little rotifer shows us something really amazing

It says that you can build a machine

that is functional complex smart

but all in a tiny little package

one so small that it's impossible to see it

Now the engineer in me is just blown away by this thing

that anyone could make such a creature

But right behind that wonder I have to admit is a bit of envy

I mean nature can do it Why can't we
 
Why can't we build tiny robots

Well I'm not the only one to have this idea

In fact in the last oh few years

researchers around the world have taken up the task

of trying to build robots

that are so small that they can't be seen

And what we're going to tell you about today

is an effort at Cornell University

and now at the University of Pennsylvania

to try to build tiny robots

OK so that's the goal

But how do we do it

How do we go about building tiny robots

Well Pablo Picasso of all people gives us our first clue

Picasso said 

[Good artists copy great artists steal]
[]
Laughter

Good artists copy Great artists steal
 
Laughter

OK But steal from what
 
Well believe it or not

most of the technology you need to build a tiny robot already exists

The semiconductor industry has been getting better and better

at making tinier and tinier devices

so at this point they could put something like a million transistors

into the size of a package that is occupied by say

a singlecelled paramecium

And it's not just electronics

They can also build little sensors

LEDs

whole communication packages that are too small to be seen

So that's what we're going to do

We're going to steal that technology

Here's a robot

Laughter

Robot's got two parts as it turns out

It's got a head and it's got legs

[Steal these Brains]
[]
Laughter

We're going to call this a legless robot

which may sound exotic

but they're pretty cool all by themselves

In fact most of you have a legless robot with you right now

Your smartphone is the world's most successful legless robot

In just  years it has taken over the entire planet

And why not

It's such a beautiful little machine

It's incredibly intelligent

it's got great communication skills

and it's all in a package that you can hold in your hand

So we would like to be able to build something like this

only down at the cellular scale

the size of a paramecium

And here it is

This is our cellsized smartphone

It even kind of looks like a smartphone

only it's about  times smaller

We call it an OWIC
OWIC
[Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits]
[]
OK we're not advertisers all right

Laughter

But it's pretty cool all by itself

In fact this OWIC has a number of parts
OWIC
So up near the top

there are these cool little solar cells that you shine light on the device

and it wakes up a little circuit that's there in the middle

And that circuit can drive a little tiny LED
LED
that can blink at you and allows the OWIC to communicate with you
OWIC
So unlike your cell phone

the OWIC communicates with light
OWIC
sort of like a tiny firefly

Now one thing that's pretty cool about these OWICs
OWIC
is we don't make them one at a time

soldering all the pieces together

We make them in massive parallel

For example about a million of these OWICs
OWIC
can fit on a single fourinch wafer

And just like your phone has different apps

you can have different kinds of OWICs
OWIC
There can be ones that say measure voltage

some that measure temperature

or just have a little light that can blink at you to tell you that it's there

So that's pretty cool these tiny little devices

And I'd like to tell you about them in a little more detail

But first I have to tell you about something else

I'm going to tell you a few things about pennies that you might not know

So this one is a little bit older penny

It's got a picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the back

But the first thing you might not know

that if you zoom in you'll find in the center of this thing

you can actually see Abraham Lincoln

just like in the real Lincoln Memorial not so far from here

What I'm sure you don't know

that if you zoom in even further 

Laughter

you'll see that there's actually an OWIC on Abe Lincoln's chest
Abe LincolnOWIC
Laughter

But the cool thing is

you could stare at this all day long and you would never see it

It's invisible to the naked eye

These OWICs are so small
OWIC
and we make them in such parallel fashion

that each OWIC costs actually less than a penny
OWIC
In fact the most expensive thing in this demo is that little sticker

that says OWIC
OWIC
Laughter

That cost about eight cents

Laughter

Now we're very excited about these things for all sorts of reasons

For example we can use them as little tiny secure smart tags

more identifying than a fingerprint

We're actually putting them inside of other medical instruments

to give other information

and even starting to think about putting them in the brain

to listen to neurons one at a time

In fact there's only one thing wrong with these OWICs
OWIC
it's not a robot

It's just a head

Laughter

And I think we'll all agree

that half a robot really isn't a robot at all

Without the legs we've got basically nothing

MM OK so you need the legs too if you want to build a robot

Now here it turns out you can't just steal

some preexisting technology

If you want legs for your tiny robot you need actuators parts that move

They have to satisfy a lot of different requirements

They need to be low voltage

They need to be low power too

But most importantly they have to be small

If you want to build a cellsized robot you need cellsized legs

Now nobody knows how to build that

There was no preexisting technology that meets all of those demands

To make our legs for our tiny robots

we had to make something new

So here's what we built

This is one of our actuators and I'm applying a voltage to it

When I do you can see the actuator respond by curling up

Now this might not look like much

but if we were to put a red blood cell up on the screen it'd be about that big

so these are unbelievably tiny curls

They're unbelievably small

and yet this device can just bend and unbend no problem nothing breaks

So how do we do it

Well the actuator is made from a layer of platinum

just a dozen atoms or so thick

Now it turns out if you take platinum and put it in water

and apply a voltage to it

atoms from the water will attach or remove themselves

from the surface of the platinum

depending on how much voltage you use

This creates a force

and you can use that force for voltagecontrolled actuation

The key here was to make everything ultrathin

Then your actuator is flexible enough

to bend to these small sizes without breaking

and it can use the forces that come about

from just attaching or removing a single layer of atoms

Now we don't have to build these one at a time either

In fact just like the OWICs
OWICs
we can build them massively in parallel as well

So here's a couple thousand or so actuators

and all I'm doing is applying a voltage

and they all wave

looking like nothing more than the legs of a future robot army

Laughter

So now we've got the brains and we've got the brawn

We've got the smarts and the actuators

The OWICs are the brains
OWIC
They give us sensors they give us power supplies

and they give us a twoway communication system via light

The platinum layers are the muscle

They're what's going to move the robot around

Now we can take those two pieces put them together

and start to build our tiny tiny robots

The first thing we wanted to build was something really simple

This robot walks around under user control

In the middle are some solar cells and some wiring attached to it

That's the OWIC
OWIC
They're connected to a set of legs which have a platinum layer

and these rigid panels that we put on top

that tell the legs how to fold up which shape they should take

The idea is that by shooting a laser at the different solar cells

you can choose which leg you want to move

and make the robot walk around

Now of course we don't build those one at a time either

We build them massively in parallel as well

We can build something like one million robots on a single fourinch wafer

So for example this image on the left this is a chip

and this chip has something like  robots on it

Now in our world the macro world

this thing looks like it might be a new microprocessor or something

But if you take that chip and you put it under a microscope

what you're going to see are thousands and thousands of tiny robots

Now these robots are still stuck down

They're still attached to the surface that we built them on

In order for them to walk around we have to release them

We wanted to show you how we do that live how we release the robot army

but the process involves highly dangerous chemicals

like really nasty stuff

and we're like a mile from the White House right now

Yeah They wouldn't let us do it
 
So 

Laughter

so we're going to show you a movie instead Laughs
 
What you're looking at here are the final stages of robot deployment

We're using chemicals

to etch the substrate out from underneath the robots

When it dissolves the robots are free to fold up into their final shapes

Now you can see here the yield's about  percent

so almost every one of those  robots we build

that's a robot that we can deploy and control later

And we can take those robots and we can put them places as well

So if you look at the movie on the left that's some robots in water

I'm going to come along with a pipette

and I can vacuum them all up

Now when you inject the robots back out of that pipette

they're just fine

In fact these robots are so small

they're small enough to pass through the thinnest hypodermic needle

you can buy

Yeah so if you wanted to

you could inject yourself full of robots

Laughter

I think they're into it

Laughter

On the right is a robot that we put in some pond water

I want you to wait for just one second

Ooop

You see that That was no shark That was a paramecium
  
So that's the world that these things live in

OK so this is all well and good

but you might be wondering at this point

Well do they walk

Right That's what they're supposed to do They better So let's find out
   
So here's the robot and here are its solar cells in the middle

Those are those little rectangles

I want you to look at the solar cell closest to the top of the slide

See that little white dot That's a laser spot
 
Now watch what happens when we start switching that laser

between different solar cells on the robot

Off it goes

Applause

Yeah

Applause

Off goes the robot marching around the microworld

Now one of the things that's cool about this movie is

I'm actually piloting the robot in this movie

In fact for six months my job was to shoot lasers at tiny cellsized robots

to pilot them around the microworld

This was actually my job

As far as I could tell that is the coolest job in the world

Laughter

It was just the feeling of total excitement

like you're doing the impossible

It's a feeling of wonder like that first time I looked through a microscope

as a kid staring at that rotifer

Now I'm a dad I have a son of my own and he's about three years old

But one day he's going to look through a microscope like that one

And I often wonder

What is he going to see

Instead of just watching the microworld

we as humans can now build technology to shape it

to interact with it to engineer it

In  years when my son is my age what will we do with that ability

Will microrobots live in our bloodstream

as common as bacteria

Will they live on our crops and get rid of pests

Will they tell us when we have infections or will they fight cancer cell by cell

PM And one cool part is
PM
you're going to be able to participate in this revolution

Ten years or so from now

when you buy your new iPhone x Moto or whatever it's called 
iPhone x Moto
Laughter

it may come with a little jar with a few thousand tiny robots in it

that you can control by an app on your cell phone

So if you want to ride a paramecium go for it

If you want to  I don't know  DJ the world's smallest robot dance party
DJ
make it happen

Laughter

And I for one am very excited about that day coming

MM Thank you

Applause

These are worms

Not the kind of worms you find crawling in the dirt

These are parasitic roundworms

They live inside a human being's intestines

Each of these worms can grow up to  inches long

and there are  of them in this jar for a reason

because that is the number you might typically find

in the belly of a single infected child

Worm infections have been around for thousands of years

They have influenced the outcomes of wars

and they have long stymied human health

Roundworm hookworm

whipworm schistosomiasis

infections from these species cause pain and discomfort

They steal nutrients and zap energy

They stunt both physical and cognitive growth

In most cases these worms may not be fatal

but paradoxically that's part of the problem

It means that many countries

simply have not been able to prioritize their treatment

There's a social cost to that

children without access to deworming treatments

have lower rates of school attendance

Adults who grow up without deworming medicine

are less productive and have lower lifelong earnings

What intestinal worms do really

is limit potential

Currently there are  billion people in the world still at risk for worms

Six hundred million of them are in Africa

For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention

African countries see up to  dollars return in economic benefits

The good news is that deworming treatment is extremely easy

One to three pills given once or twice a year

is enough to take a child from  worms to zero

and to protect them from infection going forward

In communities where there's a high prevalence of worms

treatment can be done right at school

This process is extremely simple and fast

In Ethiopia for example this is done for  million children
 
in a matter of weeks

The world has come a long way

on getting deworming medicines to the people who need them

and African governments want to gain more traction

It's now time to match their ambition

The END Fund will work with governments
END
to create a plan that drastically reduces the burden of disease caused by worms

Theyll work together to ensure prevention and treatment programs

can serve everyone

The END Fund has an audacious idea
END
they believe we are the generation to end sickness from worm infections forever

The key is not simply to build new programs from scratch

but to amplify the efforts of the programs that are already taking shape

By examining the problem of how worms transmit disease

the END Fund has identified five key areas where they can drive improvement
END
Number one lower the cost of treatment

Many pharmaceutical companies offer deworming medicines for free

so the END Fund works with the right partners
END
to coordinate their delivery

They will continue to secure drug donations

for additional atrisk populations

They can now do it for less than  cents per child per year

Number two focus on prevention

The END Fund calls in the right partners to educate communities
END
on sanitation and hygiene

in order to change behaviors around things like handwashing

and latrine use

ensuring people are not continually reinfected

Number three invest in innovation

The END Fund has contributed to deworming
END
by introducing innovative techniques that effectively target and treat people

They will test new delivery methods

target the environments where parasites thrive

and influence behavior change

Number four monitor and evaluate

The END Fund collects detailed data on all programs on a regular basis
END
to help them get better and better over time

Number five increase local ownership

At all stages of the process

the END Fund works with government and local stakeholders
END
to encourage cofinancing commitments that support deworming efforts

They also worked with African philanthropists

and corporate leaders to partner on these efforts

There's an incredible opportunity to work together to create a new system

for disease elimination for the next decade and beyond

Part of the money the END Fund needs
END
will go directly toward delivering deworming treatments

to communities that need it

and part will go towards facilitating the handover of programs

to local ownership

Together these efforts will create prevention and treatment programs

that are sustainable far into the future

If this plan gets fully funded for the next six years

tens of millions of people will receive deworming treatment

With that countries will be interrupting the cycle of disease transmission

at all levels

and most importantly people will experience significant improvements

in their mental physical and social health

Just imagine the potential that will be gained

when people can stop worrying about these

and can put their energy into things like these

Students' overlapping voices

Clapping and singing

Cheering

I am the proud father of two beautiful children

Elijah  and Octavia 

When Elijah was in the fourth grade

he came to me

came home from school bubbling over with excitement

about what he had learned that day about AfricanAmerican history

Now I'm an AfricanAmerican and cultural studies professor

and so as you can imagine

AfricanAmerican culture is kind of serious around my home

So I was very proud that my son was excited about what he had learned

that day in school

So I said What did you learn

He said I learned about Rosa Parks

I said OK what did you learn about Rosa Parks

He said I learned that Rosa Parks was this frail old black woman

in the s

in Montgomery Alabama

And she sat down on this bus

and she had tired feet

and when the bus driver told her to give up her seat to a white patron

she refused because she had tired feet

It had been a long day

and she was tired of oppression

and she didn't give up her seat

And she marched with Martin Luther King

and she believed in nonviolence

And I guess he must have looked at my face

and saw that I was a little less than impressed

by his

 um 

history lesson

And so he stopped and he was like Dad what's wrong What did I get wrong
 
I said Son you didn't get anything wrong

but I think your teacher got a whole lot of things wrong

Laughter

He said Well what do you mean

I said Rosa Parks was not tired

She was not old

And she certainly didn't have tired feet

He said What

I said Yes

Rosa Parks was only  years old 

Yeah you're shocked right Never heard that
 
Rosa Parks was only  years old

she had only worked six hours that day and she was a seamstress

and her feet were just fine

Laughter

The only thing that she was tired of

was she was tired of inequality

She was tired of oppression

And my son said

Well why would my teacher tell me this thing

This is confusing for me

Because he loved his teacher and she was a good teacher

a youngish something white woman

really really smart pushed him so I liked her as well

But he was confused Why would she tell me this he said
  
He said Dad tell me more Tell me more Tell me more about Rosa Parks
  
And I said Son I'll do you one better

He was like What

I said I'm going to buy her autobiography

and I'm going to let you read it yourself

Laughter

So as you can imagine

Elijah wasn't too excited about this new lengthy homework assignment

that his dad had just given him but he took it in stride

And he came back after he had read it

and he was excited about what he had learned

He said Dad not only was Rosa Parks not initially into nonviolence

but Rosa Parks's grandfather who basically raised her

and was light enough to pass as white

used to walk around town with his gun in his holster

and people knew if you messed with Mr Parks's children or grandchildren
 
he would put a cap in your proverbial bottom

Laughter

Right

He was not someone to mess with

And he said I also learned that Rosa Parks married a man in Raymond

who was a lot like her grandfather

He would organize

He was a civil rights activist

He would organize events

and sometimes the events would be at Rosa Parks's home

And one time Rosa Parks remarked

that there were so many guns on the table

because they were prepared for somebody to come busting into the door

that they were prepared for whatever was going to go down

that Rosa Parks said There were so many guns on the table

that I forgot to even offer them coffee or food

This is who Rosa Parks was

And in fact Rosa Parks when she was sitting on that bus that day

waiting for those police officers to arrive

and not knowing what was going to happen to her

she was not thinking about Martin Luther King

who she barely knew

She was not thinking about nonviolence or Gandhi

She was thinking about her grandfather

a guntoting takenomess grandfather

That's who Rosa Parks was thinking about

My son was mesmerized by Rosa Parks

and I was proud of him to see this excitement

But then I still had a problem

Because I still had to go his school

and address the issue with his teacher

because I didn't want her to continue to teach the kids

obviously false history

So I'm agonizing over this

primarily because I understand as an AfricanAmerican man

that whenever you talk to whites about racism

or anything that's racially sensitive

there's usually going to be a challenge

This is what white sociologist Robin DiAngelo calls white fragility
Robin DiAngelo
She argues that in fact

because whites have so little experience being challenged

about their white privilege

that whenever even the most minute challenge is brought before them

they usually cry

get angry

or run

Laughter

And I have experienced them all

And so when I was contemplating confronting his teacher

I wasn't happy about it

but I was like this is a necessary evil

of being a black parent trying to raise selfactualized black children

So I called Elijah to me and said

Elijah I'm going to set up an appointment with your teacher

and try and correct this

and maybe your principal

What do you think

And Elijah said

Dad I have a better idea

And I said Really What's your idea
 
He said We have a public speaking assignment

and why don't I use that public speaking assignment

to talk about debunking the myths of Rosa Parks

And I was like

Well that is a good idea

So Elijah goes to school

he does his presentation

he comes back home

and I could see something positive happened

I said Well what happened son

He said Well later on in that day

the teacher pulled me aside

and she apologized to me for giving that misinformation

And then something else miraculous happened the next day

She actually taught a new lesson on Rosa Parks

filling in the gaps that she had left and correcting the mistakes that she made

And I was so so proud of my son

But then I thought about it

And I got angry

And I got real angry

Why Why would I get angry
 
Because my nineyearold son had to educate his teacher

about his history

had to educate his teacher about his own humanity

He's nine years old

He should be thinking about basketball or soccer

or the latest movie

He should not be thinking about having to take the responsibility

of educating his teacher

his students

about himself about his history

That was a burden that I carried

That was a burden that my parents carried

and generations before them carried

And now I was seeing my son take on that burden too

You see that's why Rosa Parks wrote her autobiography

Because during her lifetime

if you can imagine

you do this amazing thing

you're alive and you're talking about your civil rights activism

and a story emerges

in which somebody is telling the world

that you were old and you had tired feet

and you just were an accidental activist

not that you had been activist by then for  years

not that the boycott had been planned for months

not that you were not even the first or the second or even the third woman

to be arrested for doing that

You become an accidental activist even in her own lifetime

So she wrote that autobiography to correct the record

because what she wanted to remind people of

was that this

is what it was like

in the s

trying to be black in America

and fight for your rights

During the year a little over a year that the boycott lasted

there were over four church bombings

Martin Luther King's house was bombed twice

Other civil rights leaders' houses were bombed in Birmingham

Rosa Parks's husband slept at night with a shotgun

because they would get constant death threats

In fact Rosa Parks's mother lived with them

and sometimes she would stay on the phone for hours

so that nobody would call in with death threats

because it was constant and persistent

In fact there was so much tension

there was so much pressure there was so much terrorism

that Rosa Parks and her husband they lost their jobs

and they became unemployable

and eventually had to leave and move out of the South

This is a civil rights reality

that Rosa Parks wanted to make sure that people understood

So you say Well David what does that have to do with me

I'm a wellmeaning person

I didn't own slaves

I'm not trying to whitewash history

I'm a good guy I'm a good person
 
Let me tell you what it has to do with you

and I'll tell it to you by telling you a story

about a professor of mine a white professor

when I was in graduate school who was a brilliant brilliant individual

We'll call him Fred

And Fred was writing this history of the civil rights movement

but he was writing specifically about a moment

that happened to him in North Carolina

when this white man shot this black man in cold blood in a wideopen space

and was never convicted

And so it was this great book

and he called together a couple of his professor friends

and he called me to read a draft of it before the final submission

And I was flattered that he called me

I was only a graduate student then

I was kind of feeling myself a little bit I was like OK yeah
 
I'm sitting around amongst intellectuals

and I read the draft of the book

And there was a moment in the book

that struck me as being deeply problematic

and so I said

Fred as we were sitting around talking about this draft

I said Fred I've got a real problem with this moment that you talk

about your maid in your book

And I could see Fred get a little tight as we say

He said What do you mean That's a great story
 
It happened just like I said

I said Mmm  can I give you another scenario

Now what's the story

It was 

Martin Luther King had just been assassinated

His maid domestic  we'll call her Mabel

was in the kitchen

Little Fred is eight years old

Little Fred comes into the kitchen

and Mabel who he has only seen as smiling and helpful and happy

is bent over the sink

and she's crying

and she's sobbing

inconsolably

And little Fred comes over to her and says Mabel what is wrong

Mabel turns and she says

They killed him They killed our leader They killed Martin Luther King
  
He's dead They are monsters
 
And little Fred says

It'll be OK Mabel It'll be OK It'll be OK
  
And she looked at him and she says No it's not going to be OK

Did you not hear what I just said

They killed Martin Luther King

And Fred

son of a preacher

looks up at Mabel and he says

But Mabel didn't Jesus die on the cross for our sins

Wasn't that a good outcome

Maybe this will be a good outcome

Maybe the death of Martin Luther King will lead to a good outcome

And as Fred tells the story

he says that Mabel put her hand over her mouth

she reached down and she gave little Fred a hug

and then she reached into the icebox

and took out a couple Pepsis

gave him some Pepsis

and sent him on his way to play with his siblings

And he said

This was proof that even in the most harrowing times of race struggle

that two people could come together across racial lines

and find human commonality

along the lines of love and affection

And I said Fred that is some BS
BS
Laughter

Applause

Fred was like

But I don't understand David That's the story
 
I said Fred let me ask you a question

I said You were in North Carolina in 

If Mabel would've went to her community  you were eight years old 

what do you think the eightyearold AfricanAmerican children

were calling her

Do you think they called her by her first name

No they called her Miss Mabel

or they called her Miss Johnson or they called her Auntie Johnson

They would have never dared call her by her first name

because that would have been the height of disrespect

And yet you were calling her by her first name

every single day that she worked

and you never thought about it

I said Let me ask you another question Was Mabel married

Did she have children

What church did she go to

What was her favorite dessert

Fred could not answer any of those questions

I said Fred this story is not about Mabel

This story is about you

I said This story made you feel good

but this story is not about Mabel

The reality is

what probably happened was Mabel was crying

which was not something she customarily did

so she was letting her guard down

And you came into the kitchen

and you caught her at a weak moment where she was letting her guard down

And see because you thought of yourself as just like one of her children

you didn't recognize that you were in fact the child of her employer

And she'd found herself yelling at you

And then she caught herself

realizing that 'If I'm yelling at him

and he goes back and he tells his dad or he tells mom

I could lose my job'

And so she tempered herself and she ended up 

even though she needed consoling  she ended up consoling you

and sending you on your way

perhaps so she could finish mourning in peace

And Fred was stunned

And he realized that he had actually misread that moment

And see this is what they did to Rosa Parks

Because it's a lot easier to digest an old grandmother with tired feet

who doesn't stand up because she wants to fight for inequality

but because her feet and her back are tired

and she's worked all day

See old grandmothers are not scary

But young radical black women

who don't take any stuff from anybody

are very scary

who stand up to power

and are willing to die for that 

those are not the kind of people

that make us comfortable

So you say

What do you want me to do David

I don't know what to do

Well what I would say to you is

there was a time in which

if you were Jewish you were not white

if you were Italian you were not white

if you were Irish you were not white

in this country

It took a while before the Irish the Jews and the Italians became white

Right

There was a time in which you were othered

when you were the people on the outside

Toni Morrison said

If in order for you to be tall I have to be on my knees

you have a serious problem

She says White America has a serious serious problem

To be honest I don't know if race relations will improve in America

But I know that if they will improve

we have to take these challenges on head on

The future of my children depends on it

The future of my children's children depends on it

And whether you know it or not

the future of your children and your children's children

depends on it too

Thank you

Applause

I danced with Bella for the first time

as Bei Mir Bistu Shein filled the room

And her blue eyes locked with mine

We took turns singing

and forgetting the words

She led I followed

A waltz step here

a shimmy here

Rattle sound

Laughter

Hands on our hearts

our foreheads touching

as we communicated through movement and music

making sense through nonsense

Bella is  and lives with dementia

The dance gives us a chance to find each other

How did I learn to dance with dementia

Because I'm not a dancer

And I'm not a doctor

But I've played one in the hospital

Laughs

I'm a clown doctor

Or a medical clown

My tools are whoopee cushions

shakers

Shaker rattles

and a red nose

You know the old adage laughter is the best medicine

I hear that a lot

Now at the same time there are studies to support it

but right now

I'd like to take you behind the nose and go beyond the laughter

and share a few things that I've seen skating through ICUs
ICU
In my Heelys

Size 

Because I take medical clowning

very very seriously

Deflating sound

Laughter

Deflating sound

Deflating sound

Laughter

My mentor was conducting clown rounds in the hospital

when he was approached by a nurse

They needed to put a tube up the kid's nose

Kid didn't want to do it

so rather than hold the kid down

they asked my colleague if he could help

So the clown asked for a second tube

and shoved it up his own nose

Kid of like this

Oh please don't do this at home

Laughter

Now the kid saw this

grabbed his own tube

and promptly stuck it up his own nose

kind of like this

Applause

The clowns the nurse and the patient

discovered a creative solution for their situation together

And guess what there's research to back this up

Randomized controlled trials in Israel and Italy

show that medical clowns can be as effective as tranquilizers

with no side effects

In  I started conducting my own clown rounds

at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City

My colleague and I were invited to accompany a young sixyearold

with the most adorable southern accent

to accompany him while he got his chemotherapy port flushed

a very uncomfortable and regular procedure

We joined him his mom and the nurse

in this tiny closed curtain cubicle

Every medical clown encounter begins by obtaining consent from the patient

So we ask him if we can be there

He says Sure

We're often the one element that a child could control

while they're in the hospital

So we start with a card trick

fan the deck so he can pick

But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle

to flush the port

he starts screaming and cussing

like no sixyearold I'd ever heard in my life

So we say Hey should we come back later

He stops mouth open

eyes wet with tears face flushed pink with anger

and he smiles

Oh no you're fine I want you to be here

OK

So we start playing a song

my colleague on recorder me on whoopee cushion

The nurse approaches with the needle

and it happens again this torrent of fourletter words

He went from playing and laughing

to screaming and crying

back and forth until the procedure was complete

For the first time

I experienced this odd duality of joy and suffering

But not for the last time

See when we're there we're not there merely to distract

or make anyone feel better per se

The medical clowns work moment by moment

to create connections between the clowns

the nurse the parent and the child

This provides a source of power or control for the child

while supporting the staff with their work

I've spent over a decade bringing joy and delight

to the bedsides of terminally ill children

in the top hospitals in New York City

And you know what I've learned

Everyone's hurting

Staff family patients

The patient's in the hospital because they're hurting

The family's hurting as they navigate uncertainty grief

and the financial burdens of care

The staff is hurting only it's more than burnout

More and more health care workers

are reporting feeling overworked and overextended

Now I'm not so naive as to suggest

that the solution is to send in the clowns

Laughter

But what if

What if the tools of medical clown arts practitioners from around the world

permeated our entire health care system

In  at the Healthcare Clowning International Meeting

they represented over  programs in  different countries

University of Haifa

offers a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning

Argentina has passed laws requiring the presence of medical clowns

in public hospitals at their largest province

And this work affects more than the patients

It makes things better for the whole health care team

One of my favorite games to play in the hospital

is elevator music

I love elevators because they're a place

where paths cross different worlds meet

It's intimate

uncomfortably quiet

and just begging for a little playful disruption

The doors close

and The Girl from Ipanema starts playing on Hammond organ

because I keep a portable speaker hidden in my pocket

So for those used to using the silent sterile elevator

it's a moment of surprise

Folks have permission to acknowledge or not this disruption

The game grows with every stop

because as soon as the elevator stops

the music stops

New passengers get on

and the current passengers get to witness the new passengers 

their surprise  as they hear the elevator music for the first time

You experience the shift of adults

standing silently strangers in an elevator

to attempting to suppress their mirth

to Is this a party or an elevator

filled with fullon laughter

Research conducted in Brazil

Australia Canada and Germany

confirm that the artistic interventions of medical clowns

improve the work environment for the staff beyond the elevator

and support their work administering care

Promising research in the US indicates

that arts programing in the hospital

can improve the work environment

leading to increased job satisfaction

and better quality of care

My work has taught me

how to actually be present

How to breathe in a room with a person in pain

How to connect

and build trust no matter the age ability or illness

And how medical clowning is an excellent way of using the arts

to put the care back in health care

Thanks

Transcriber Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez
Joseph Geni ReviewerCamille Mart  nez
I have to admit that it's a lot of fun

when people ask me what I do for my job

because I tell them I literally rub things together

This sounds ridiculous

just rubbing things together

But it has a technical name

tribology

Tribology
TRIBOOGY
from the ancient Greek word tribos
tribos
which means to rub

It's a funnysounding word you've probably never heard before

but I promise you

discovering it changes your experience with the physical world

Tribology has given me amazing projects

I've worked on materials that fly and I've worked on dog food 

a combination that doesn't sound like one person has any business doing

in the span of just a couple years

until you start to view the world through a tribological lens

And I think you'll be surprised

at how significant a little bit of tribology can be

in alleviating some very large problems

Tribology is the study of friction wear and lubrication

You have all experienced all three of these things

Remember the last time you tried to move a heavy object across the floor

and you could just feel something resisting you

That would be friction

Friction is the force that opposes motion

Wear is the loss or transfer of material

It's the reason you have to replace your favorite shoes

because eventually the soles disappear

Lubricants are used to reduce friction and wear

They loosen up those stubborn rusted bolts that just otherwise will not budge

But tribology is also defined as the science of interacting surfaces

in relative motion

So interacting surfaces in relative motion

there are a lot of those in the world

As you're sitting there right now are you wiggling your foot at all

or maybe shifting around in your seat

Because guess what Tribology is happening
 
Even the smallest shift in your seat

involves two surfaces moving relative to each other

And your tribological interaction for the shift

will be different than the person next to you

This is because the clothes you're wearing

change the friction between you and the seat

If you're wearing silk it's a little easier to squirm around in the seat

than if you're wearing wool

That's because the friction is lower for silk

If you're moving your ankle or wiggling your ankle at all

did it make a popping sound

You've had that right

You get up you move around and some joint cracks or pops

Thank you for that sound tribology

That sound can come from the fluid that lubricates your joints

just moving around

You're essentially releasing gas bubbles in that fluid

That sound can also come from the tendons simply moving over each other

Pretty common in the ankle

so any of my fellow footwigglers out there

may suddenly find themselves curious about the tribology of tendons

But how does one become a tribologist like me

It starts when you're a kid of course

I was a ballerina growing up

I reached the level where I was dancing on my toes

or en pointe

Now when you're dancing en pointe you're wearing those amazing shoes

but they can be slippery on the stage

The last thing you want to do when you're trying to dance on your toes

is to slip and fall

So we had boxes of stuff called rosin

We would step into the rosin put a light coating on our shoes

Rosin comes from tree sap

and in its powdered form makes things less slippery

You learned real fast as a dancer

how much was the right amount to put on your shoes

because if you didn't put enough on you were probably going to slip

due to the low friction between your shoe and the stage

Best case scenario

you're the clumsy ballerina on stage

but the worst case scenario would be an injury

Already I was optimizing and manipulating friction

You see I was destined to be a tribologist

Laughter

But you were also a junior tribologist

When you used crayons or colored pencils

you knew that the harder you pressed the darker the color

You also knew this meant you were going to have to sharpen

that crayon or colored pencil more frequently

because it was wearing down faster

Now let's talk about those enticing shiny waxed floors

that you just had to slide across

You knew if you put on a pair of socks

you were going to get a really good slide across that floor

Good luck trying to do that barefoot

Master manipulators of friction

All kids are tribologists

What about us as adults

At some point today you brushed your teeth

I hope

Laughter

This is tribology in action

The toothpaste and toothbrush are working to remove or wear

the plaque from your teeth

For the record my dad is a dentist

Never thought my career was going to circle back to the family business

But one day we found ourselves speaking the same language

when I was tasked with developing a test to investigate plaque removal

Sounded simple enough

until I started to look at it as a tribologist

and then it became incredibly complex

You have hard materials  those would be your teeth 

soft materials like your gums the toothpaste the toothbrush

There's lubrication  the form of saliva and water 

the dynamics of the person doing the brushing and more

I promise if we put diamonds in your toothpaste

you're going to remove that plaque

Probably going to remove your teeth as well

So there's a fine balance to be had between wearing the plaque away

and not damaging your teeth and gums

We're brushing our teeth because we ate

Eating is another routine thing we all do

Seems simple enough

But it's another field of tribology

and it's not so simple

You have the food which will break and wear while you're eating

and that food is interacting with your teeth your tongue

your saliva your throat

And all of those interactions are going to influence your experience of eating

I think you can all recall a moment where you tried something new

and you just found yourself going

Well it tastes alright

I really don't like that texture

Tribologists are looking at lubricity the coefficient of friction

as ways to connect mouth feel and texture to what you're experiencing

so that if we're changing the formulations of what we're eating and drinking

so the sugar content or fat content are different

how does that change mouth feel

How do we quantify that

This is what tribologists are looking to solve

And while my colleagues were in one corner of this lab

looking at the fat content of yogurt

I was in another corner

studying dog food

That lab smelled really good by the way let me tell you

We all brush our teeth on a regular basis

How many of us brush our pets' teeth

Animals as adults commonly get periodontal disease

so we really should be brushing their teeth

and more pet owners are starting to do this

I know my best friend is really great at brushing her cat's teeth somehow

Good luck trying to do that with my cat

So what pet food suppliers are trying to do

is incorporate plaque removal in things like treats

If you have a dog

you may have observed that you give a dog a treat

and it magically seems to disappear after just one bite

So the added challenge here is

How do you remove plaque when you have one bite

I developed a benchtop test to study this problem

and to do so I had to mimic the oral system of dogs

their teeth plaque saliva

And I used friction and wear measurements

to study the effectiveness of that treat on removing plaque

If you're sitting there right now thinking about the last time

you didn't brush your dog's teeth you're very welcome

But what's the big deal with tribology

Let me give you one more example

No matter where you are right now you got to this location somehow

Maybe you walked or rode your bike

but for most people in this room you probably came in a car

Just think about all the tribological systems in a car

You have your personal interactions with the car

the car's interactions with the road

and everything under the hood and in the drivetrain

Some routine maintenance is directly connected to tribology

You know how many miles your tires are recommended for using

before you replace them

You regularly check the treads on those tires

You're actively monitoring the wear of your tires

Tribology is the study of wear and friction

and with tires friction can be the difference between a safe arrival

and a car accident

This is because the friction between your tires and the road

will influence your acceleration your deceleration

and your stopping distance

As a driver you instinctively already know how important friction is

because you know that when the roads are wet

they're more dangerous because they're slippery

This is because the water is reducing the friction

between your tires and the road

You may recall that friction is the force that opposes motion

so water reducing that force means it's now easier for you to move

hence it's more slippery when the roads are wet

Something else to consider

is that overcoming friction takes energy

so you're losing energy to friction

This is one way your tires can influence your fuel efficiency

And in fact did you know that about onethird of the fuel

that you put into your internal combustion engine vehicle

will be spent overcoming friction

Onethird

Tribology research has helped us reduce friction

and therefore increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions

Holmberg and Erdemir have actually done some great studies
HolmbergErdemir
showing the impact tribology research can have

on reducing our energy consumption

And they found that looking over the span of  years

we had the opportunity to reduce

the energy consumption of passenger vehicles

up to  percent

When you think about all the cars in the world

that's a lot of energy we can save

It's part of the nearly nine percent of our current global energy consumption

that the authors identified tribology can help us save

That's a significant amount of energy

So when you look at the numbers tribology can do some amazing things

My colleagues have identified up to  quads of energy

we can save across the US alone

To put this in perspective

one quad of energy is roughly equivalent to  million barrels of oil

and tribology can help us save  times that

This is through new materials new lubricants

novel component design

doing things like making wind turbines more efficient and reliable

This happened just by putting  people in a room

who viewed the world through a tribology lens

Imagine the opportunities that will reveal themselves

as more of us start to see tribology all around

My favorite projects right now are in aerospace applications

I love reducing wear and friction in these challenging environments

I can make materials and parts

that will reduce the friction in moving components and engines

so that they have less force opposing their motion

Less force to move means they require less power

so you can use a smaller actuator

which would weigh less

which saves fuel

I can also help make parts that last longer through lower wear

This will reduce material waste

and also means we're manufacturing the parts less frequently

so we're saving energy in manufacturing

I encourage you to start seeing tribology in the world around you

and to think about how you would improve those interacting surfaces you experience

Even the smallest improvements

really add up

Tribology may be a funnysounding word

but it has a huge impact on our world

Thank you

Laughter

Speaks Spanish

That was the first time I experienced an act of totalitarian censorship

Laughter

Speaks Spanish

But a lack of freedom stimulates creativity and empowers it

Speaks Spanish

Many years have passed since my childhood

but throughout my formal studies

I found myself drawing in the margins of my notebooks

instead of paying attention to my professors

I studied journalism in college

with the intention of expanding my communication and writing skills

but the only thing that I felt connected to in life

was drawing

Speaks Spanish

I was born in a democracy

in a country called Venezuela which is now a dictatorship

Speaks Spanish

For  years

I was the daily cartoonist for El Universal
El Universal
one of the biggest newspapers in Venezuela

I really enjoyed translating political and cultural current events into drawings

Speaks Spanish

In the year 

I got fired from my job at the newspaper over a cartoon that I drew

alluding to the health care system in Venezuela

I drew a flat line of a heartbeat monitor

but I intentionally drew the heartbeat line

in a way that resembled the signature of Hugo Chavez

the former president of Venezuela

Laughter

Speaks Spanish

All of this happened after the newspaper was bought

by an unknown company

and some of us suspect

that it was the Venezuelan government who was behind that deal

Speaks Spanish

My work as a cartoonist became more and more of a nuisance

for the dictatorship

They have no tolerance for any freedom of expression

or free thinking

Speaks Spanish

After I got fired

I started to feel unsafe in my own country

I received anonymous calls and death threats

I was mocked publicly on national television

I was eventually forced out of Venezuela

and I now live in Miami Florida

where I am free to be my own editor for my work

Speaks Spanish

A political cartoon is a barometer of freedom in a country

That's why dictators hate cartoonists

and try to eradicate everything that involves humor

as a mirror for social and political issues

Speaks Spanish

A cartoon involves a delicate balance of ideas and drawings

that reveal a hidden truth

Speaks Spanish

And a good cartoon is one that conveys a plot of a fulllength movie

in a single frame

Speaks Spanish

A cartoon needs to communicate the core of a story with its precision

And when it succeeds

its message can have the effect of inoculating people

with a dose of skepticism

Speaks Spanish

Cartoons are drawn from observation and analysis

They are inspired by muses of mythology

as well as classical modern and paleolithic tales

Laughter

When we are told that a modernday emperor is wearing new clothes

cartoons reveal that the emperor just might still be naked

Speaks Spanish

At one point in my career

I drew pigs and compared them with politicians and national guards

who were responsible for stopping peaceful student demonstrations

One day when I got back to my office

I had a letter on my desk

Speaks Spanish

The letter was from the Venezuelan Swine Federation

Laughter

Speaks Spanish

The letter said

Please do not compare an animal as wonderful as a pig with politicians

Laughter

Pigs are very friendly and noble

they can be a great mascot

they make good pets

and they provide sustenance to us in the form of pork

Speaks Spanish

I think they were absolutely right

I didn't draw any more pigs

but I did keep drawing politicians

Laughter

Speaks Spanish

A cartoon travels on an information highway

which seems like it has multiple lanes

but in reality all of these lanes

lead to a binary response of either positivity or rage

I like it or I don't like it

Those are the only responses

that govern democratic thinking on the internet

Speaks Spanish

We have lost the space for nuanced debate

we have no time

so we simply respond with approval or disdain

and we let algorithms take over

Speaks Spanish

But a cartoon is born from a space of deep nuanced thinking

Creating a good cartoon involves repeated failures

draft after draft

And a cartoonist must shed their own taboos

to spark a conversation rather than a confrontation

through their work

Speaks Spanish

In the year  President Chavez died

and I had to think about what to draw as the cartoon of the day

at El Universal
El Universal
I was personally happy that he had passed away

because I thought that the end of his power

would potentially bring our country closer to freedom and better times

Speaks Spanish

But there were many other people who were mourning the death of Chavez

so there was a divided sentiment in Venezuela

Some were celebrating

and others were crying at the loss of their leader

Speaks Spanish

I felt stuck

I really didn't know what to draw in this historic moment

And I knew that I couldn't allow my happiness to seep into my work

that I should take the higher road and respect people's grief

So what could I draw

Speaks Spanish

I spent many hours drafting and throwing out papers

My editor called me and said

everything was late for that day's newspaper

and asked me when I'd be done

It was in the middle of the night that the idea came to me

And we then published a cartoon

that represented a historical moment in time

Speaks Spanish

A fallen king chess piece in red

Speaks Spanish

A good cartoon has a lot of power

It can generate action and reaction

That's why a cartoonist must exercise their power responsibly

showcasing the truth

and drawing without the fear of consequences

Speaks Spanish

Having an opinion has a cost

and in some countries that cost is high

Speaks Spanish

In Venezuela

many young people have been killed for protesting peacefully

There are men and women who are stuck behind bars

as political prisoners

So over the years

I've drawn the faces of imprisoned women

because I don't want them to be forgotten by the community

Speaks Spanish

This year at an event called El Foro Penal
El Foro Penal
which is a criminal forum

where a group of lawyers do pro bono work

for Venezuelan political prisoners

a young woman approached me and she said

I was imprisoned

and then you drew my face and my story

It's because of that drawing that people knew who I was

Your cartoon helped me survive my days in prison

Thank you

Speaks Spanish

This was a moment that meant a lot to me

because I had found a way to collaborate

with the memories of my country and its people

Speaks Spanish

Last year I started making drawings about immigration

I drew my own world my fears

my suitcase my roots

and everything that I had to leave behind in Venezuela

I also drew my joy in the face of this new opportunity

as an immigrant in the United States

Speaks Spanish

From there I worked on a series of drawings

that represented the experience and psychology of immigration

Speaks Spanish

Being an immigrant is like moving to another planet

At first you don't understand anything about your new world

There are new codes a new language

and unfamiliar tools you need to learn how to use

in order to adapt to your new life

Speaks Spanish

Being an immigrant is the closest thing to being an astronaut

who landed on the moon

Speaks Spanish

Over time that series of drawings became a traveling exhibition

called I Immigrant

And the exhibition traveled to multiple cities

including Miami Houston Madrid Barcelona

and we're hoping for more places

Speaks Spanish

The show has become a meeting space for the diaspora

for people to gather and recognize their shared experiences of suffering

that come with immigration

Speaks Spanish

What I want these drawings to convey

is that an immigrant is not a criminal

An immigrant is a person whose life has been broken

A person who has very likely been separated from their family

under inhumane conditions

Who has been forced to leave their country in search of a better life

Speaks Spanish

A drawing can be a synthesis of a place

a universe a country or a society

It can also represent the inner workings of someone's mind

For me drawing cartoons is a form of resistance

Speaks Spanish

A cartoon is like a Rosetta stone

If we throw it into outer space

a future alien would be able to know with certainty

that in the past

we once had a civilized world with free thinking

Speaks Spanish

That one wall that my mother gave me the freedom to draw on feels infinite

And it's for that reason that I am still drawing

Thank you very much

Cheers and applause

Ever since I can remember

African elephants have filled me with a sense of complete awe

They are the largest land mammal alive today on planet Earth

weighing up to seven tons

standing three and a half meters tall at the shoulder

They can eat up to  kilos of food in a day

and they disperse vital plant seeds across thousands of kilometers

during their toyear life span

Central to their compassionate and complex society are the matriarchs

These female strong leaders nurture the young

and navigate their way through the challenges of the African bush

to find food water and security

Their societies are so complex

we're yet to still fully tease apart

how they communicate how they verbalize to each other

how their dialects work

And we don't really understand yet how they navigate the landscape

remembering the safest places to cross a river

I'm pretty sure that like me

most of you in this room have a similar positive emotional response

to these most magnificent of all animals

It's really hard not to have watched a documentary

learned about their intelligence

or if you've been lucky to see them for yourselves

on safari in the wild

But I wonder how many of you

have been truly utterly terrified by them

I was lucky to be brought up in Southern Africa

by two teacher parents

who had long holidays but very short budgets

And so we used to take our old Ford Cortina Estate

and with my sister we'd pile in the back

take our tents and go camping in the different game reserves

in Southern Africa

It really was heaven for a young budding zoologist like myself

But I remember even at that young age

that I found the tall electric fences blocking off the game parks

quite divisive

Sure they were keeping elephants out of the communities

but they also kept communities out of their wild spaces

It really was quite a challenge to me at that young age

It was only when I moved to Kenya at the age of 

when I got to connect to the vast wild open spaces of East Africa

And it is here now that I feel truly instinctively

really at home

I spent many many happy years studying elephant behavior in a tent

in Samburu National Reserve

under the guideship of professor Fritz Vollrath and Iain DouglasHamilton
Fritz VollrathIain DouglasHamilton
studying for my PhD and understanding the complexities of elephant societies

But now in my role as head of the humanelephant coexistence program

for Save the Elephants

we're seeing so much change happening so fast

that it's urged a change in some of our research programs

No longer can we just sit and understand elephant societies

or study just how to stop the ivory trade

which is horrific and still ongoing

We're having to change our resources more and more

to look at this rising problem of humanelephant conflict

as people and pachyderms compete for space and resources

It was only as recently as the s

that we used to have  million elephants roaming across Africa

Today we're edging closer to only having  left

And at the same time period the human population has quadrupled

and the land is being fragmented at such a pace

that it's really hard to keep up with

Too often these migrating elephants end up stuck inside communities

looking for food and water

but ending up breaking open water tanks

breaking pipes

and of course breaking into food stores for food

It's really a huge challenge

Can you imagine the terror

of an elephant literally ripping the roof off your mud hut

in the middle of the night

and having to hold your children away

as the trunk reaches in looking for food in the pitch dark

These elephants also trample and eat crops

and this is traditionally eroding away

that tolerance that people used to have for elephants

And sadly we're losing these animals by the day

and in some countries by the hour 

to not only ivory poaching

but this rapid rise in humanelephant conflict

as they compete for space and resources

It's a massive challenge

I mean how do you keep seventon pachyderms

that often come in groups of  or 

out of these very small rural farms

when you're dealing with people

who are living on the very edge of poverty

They don't have big budgets

How do you resolve this issue

Well one issue is you can just start to build electric fences

and this is happening across Africa

we're seeing this more and more

But they are dividing up areas and blocking corridors

And I'm telling you these elephants don't think much of it either

particularly if they're blocking a really special water hole

where they need water

or if there's a very attractive female on the other side

It doesn't take long to knock down one of these poles

And as soon as there's a gap in the fence

they go back talk to their mates

and suddenly they're all through

and now you have  elephants on the community side of the fence

And now you're really in trouble

People keep trying to come up with new designs for electric fences

Well these elephants don't think much of those either

Laughter

So rather than having these hardline straight electric

really divisive migratoryblocking fences

there must be other ways to look at this challenge

I'm much more interested in holistic and natural methods

to keep elephants and people apart where necessary

Simply talking to people

talking to rural pastoralists in northern Kenya

who have so much knowledge about the bush

we discovered this story that they had that elephants would not feed on trees

that had wild beehives in them

Now this was an interesting story

As the elephants were foraging on the tree

they would break branches and perhaps break open a wild beehive

And those bees would fly out of their natural nests

and sting the elephants

Now if the elephants got stung

perhaps they would remember that this tree was dangerous

and they wouldn't come back to that same site

It seems impossible that they could be stung through their thick skin 

elephant skin is around two centimeters thick

But it seems that they sting them around the watery areas

around the eyes behind the ears in the mouth up the trunk

You can imagine they would remember that very quickly

And it's not really one sting that they're scared of

African bees have a phenomenal ability

when they sting in one site they release a pheromone

that triggers the rest of the bees to come and sting the same site

So it's not one beesting that they're scared of 

it's perhaps thousands of beestings

coming to sting in the same area  that they're afraid of

And of course a good matriarch

would always keep her young away from such a threat

Young calves have much thinner skins

and it's potential that they could be stung

through their thinner skins

So for my PhD I had this unusual challenge

of trying to work out

how African elephants and African bees would interact

when the theory was that they wouldn't interact at all

How was I going to study this

Well what I did was I took the sound of disturbed African honey bees

and I played it back to elephants resting under trees

through a wireless speaker system

so I could understand how they would react as if there were wild bees in the area

And it turns out that they react quite dramatically

to the sound of African wild bees

Here we are playing the bee sounds back to this amazing group of elephants

You can see the ears going up going out

they're turning their heads from side to side

one elephant is flicking her trunk to try and smell

There's another elephant that kicks one of calves on the ground

to tell it to get up as if there is a threat

And one elephant triggers a retreat

and soon the whole family of elephants are running after her

across the savannah in a cloud of dust

Sound of bees buzzing

Sound of bees ends

Now I've done this experiment many many times

and the elephants almost always flee

Not only do they run away

but they dust themselves as they're running

as if to knock bees out of the air

And we placed infrasonic microphones around the elephants

as we did these experiments

And it turns out they're communicating to each other in infrasonic rumbles

to warn each other of the threat of bees

and to stay away from the area

So these behavioral discoveries

really helped us understand how elephants would react

should they hear or see bee sounds

This led me to invent a novel design for a beehive fence

which we are now building around small onetotwoacre farms

on the most vulnerable frontline areas of Africa

where humans and elephants are competing for space

These beehive fences are very very simple

We use  beehives and  dummy hives

to protect one acre of farmland

Now a dummy hive is simply a piece of plywood

which we cut into squares paint yellow

and hang in between the hives

We're basically tricking the elephants

into thinking there are more beehives than there really are

And of course it literally halves the cost of the fence

So there's a hive and a dummy hive

and a beehive and now dummy hive

every  meters around the outside boundary

They're held up by posts

with a shade roof to protect the bees

and they're interconnected with a simple piece of plain wire

which goes all the way around connecting the hives

So if an elephant tries to enter the farm

he will avoid the beehive at all cost

but he might try and push through between the hive and the dummy hive

causing all the beehives to swing as the wire hits his chest

And as we know from our research work

this will cause the elephants to flee and run away 

and hopefully remember not to come back to that risky area

The bees swarm out of the hive

and they really scare the elephants away

These beehive fences we're studying using things like camera traps

to help us understand how elephants are responding

to them at night time

which is when most of the crop raiding occurs

And we found in our study farms

that we're keeping up to  percent of elephants

outside of the boundaries of these farms

And the bees and the beehive fences are also pollinating the fields

So we're having a great reduction both in elephant crop raids

and a boost in yield through the pollination services

that the bees are giving to the crops themselves

The strength of the beehive fences is really important 

the colonies have to be very strong

So we're trying to help farmers grow pollinatorfriendly crops

to boost their hives

boost the strength of their bees

and of course produce the most amazing honey

This honey is so valuable as an extra livelihood income for the farmers

It's a healthy alternative to sugar

and in our community

it's a very valuable present to give a motherinlaw

which makes it almost priceless

Laughter

We now bottle up this honey

and we've called this wild beautiful honey ElephantFriendly Honey

It is a fun name

but it also attracts attention to our project

and helps people understand what we're trying to do

to save elephants

We're working now with so many women

in over  humanelephant conflict sites

in  countries in Africa and Asia

to build these beehive fences

working very very closely with so many farmers

but particularly now with women farmers

helping them to live better in harmony with elephants

One of the things we're trying to do is develop a toolbox of options

to live in better harmony with these massive pachyderms

One of those issues is to try and get farmers

and women in particular

to think different about what they're planting

inside their farms as well

So we're looking at planting crops

that elephants don't particularly want to eat like chillies

ginger Moringa sunflowers

And of course the bees and the beehive fences love these crops too

because they have beautiful flowers

One of these plants is a spiky plant called sisal 

you may know this here as jute

And this amazing plant can be stripped down

and turned into a weaving product

We're working with these amazing women now

who live daily with the challenges of elephants

to use this plant to weave into baskets

to provide an alternative income for them

We've just started construction only three weeks ago

on a women's enterprise center

where we're going to be working with these women

not only as expert beekeepers

but as amazing basket weavers

they're going to be processing chili oils sunflower oils

making lip balms and honey

and we're somewhere on our way to helping these participating farmers

live with better ecogenerating projects that live and work better

with living with elephants

So whether it's matriarchs

or mothers or researchers like myself

I do see more women coming to the forefront now

to think differently and more boldly about the challenges that we face

With more innovation

and perhaps with some more empathy towards each other

I do believe we can move from a state of conflict with elephants

to true coexistence

Thank you

What is our imagery of cities

When we imagine cities

we often imagine it to be something like this

But what if what you're looking at is just half a picture

but there is a city within the city

This part of the city is often seen as slums

squatters informal

and people living here are called illegal informal

criminals beneficiaries supplicants etc

But in reality

these are poor people with no choices

Poverty is a vicious cycle

If born poor it can take three or more generations

to escape one

Many are forced in this cycle without choices

to live on pavements

along train tracks

in dumping grounds

along rivers

swamps and many such unlivable spaces

without clean water toilets or housing

But these places are not unfamiliar to me

because since the age of six I accompanied my father a doctor

who treated patients in the slums of Bombay

Growing up I would help him carry his bag of medicines

after school lessons 

I loved doing that

Wanting to do something about these habitats

I decided to become an architect

But quite early on I realized

that the beauty of architecture was only for the rich

So I decided to do urban planning

and joined an NGO in India that works with the urban poor

who organize themselves to access basic services

such as water sanitation and housing for the poor living in cities

Now I spent  years of my life in professional education in learning

and then five years in unlearning it

Because I realized

that all my training in architecture design and planning

failed ground realities

And this is where I learned the power of choice

I unlearned many things

but there are two myths about the poor

that I would like to share that we live with

The first myth is a perception

that migration of poor people into cities is a problem

Is migration really a choice

My mentor Sheela Patel

asked to those who think of this as a problem

Go ask your grandfather where he came from she says

So what do poor people do when they migrate in cities

Let me share an example

This is the Mumbai International Airport

All that you see in blue are large informal settlements around it

Close to  people live here

So who are these people that work silently in hotels restaurants

as laborers babysitters house helps

and countless other jobs

that we need for cities to function without a glitch

And where do they live

In most cities they live in slums

So let us think again

Do we want poor people to stop migrating in our cities

What if they had a choice of not to

The second myth is my personal experience

It's this attitude that we professionals know better

We professionals love to make choices for others

especially for the poor

Let me share an experience

In a workshop that looked at designing  new houses for poor families

from a slum nearby

there were different building materials that were presented

ranging from papiermach cardboard honeycomb etc

simply because they were affordable

But there was this one idea that was of shipping containers

Now we immediately approved of it

because we thought it was sustainable scalable affordable

But during this presentation

a lady from the slum humbly spoke up

And she asked the presenter

Would you choose to live in it

Laughter

If not then why did you think we would

Now this was a personal unlearning moment for me

where I realized that poverty only changes affordability 

it does not change aspirations

Now poor people have lived in temporary structures all their life

They go from wall to wall

moving from bricks to tin

They move from building from bamboo

tarpaulin sheets plastic to cardboard to tin

to bricks and cement

just like the way we do

So somewhere here we were forcing our choices on them

So should we force our choices on them

or should we broaden their choices

Now what if the opportunity to choose was given to people

These are women who lived on the pavements of a neighborhood in Mumbai

Now they faced constant evictions and in response to it

they organized a women's network called Mahila Milan
Mahila Milan
Not only did they fight against evictions with those in power

saved money and bought land

but they also designed and helped construct their own houses

Well these were illiterate women so how did they do that

They used floor mats and saris to understand measurements

A sari is four meters in length and  meters in width

They used these simple daytoday items to demonstrate house models

And even they made three options to choose from

and invited all their fellow residents to come and have a look

Laughter

And everybody loved this option that had a loft in it

simply because it did two things

One is that it accommodated larger families to sleep in

And two it allowed homebased work

such as banglemaking jewelrydesigning

embroiderystitching packaging items etc

Now they also decided to not have a toilet inside

but instead have it outside in the corridors

simply because it gave them more space and it was cheaper

Now professionals could have never thought

of something like that

A formal design would have necessitated to have a toilet inside

Now these are smaller examples 

let me share some larger context

 people 

that's about one sixth of this world as we talk here 

are living in slums and informal settlements

Almost every city in the global south has large slums in the size of townships

Kibera in Nairobi

Dharavi in Mumbai

Khayelitsha in South Africa just a few
Khayelitsha
Now initially they were all on waste and abandoned lands

that cities were never interested in

As cities grew

poor people started building on these lands

and brought value to this over time

And today these lands have become real estate hot spots

that everybody wants a piece of

So how do cities and those in power choose to deal with them

They demolish them and evict them

and move them away from their cities and economies

in order to build a new infrastructure

They move them into vertical housing

which in reality looks like this

Now when built in high densities

they lack natural light and ventilation

and it often leads to unhealthy conditions

Now on one hand

poor people are not involved in the participation of design

and there is poor quality of construction

And on the other hand

they do not understand how to do maintenance

you know keeping bills keeping records forming societies 

this is always difficult for them

And being forced to move into this formal society

they end up looking like this in a few years

Because formalization is not a product

it's a process

Moving from informal to formal for poor people is a journey

It takes time to accept and adapt

And when that choice is not given

it becomes like this

which I'm afraid in future these would become the slums

Now instead of doing this

what if we accommodated poor people

and gave them a choice to be a part of our cities

and develop them where they are

giving them basic services like in this picture

Now what happens if cities and governments could work together

if governments acknowledge poor people

and they could build it together

This is Mukuru

It's a large informal settlement in Nairobi

It's one of the largest settlements in Africa

It's home to  people

living over  acres of land

To help us understand that scale

it's like squeezing the population of Pittsburgh

into the New York Central Park

That's Mukuru

So to give us a glimpse

this is the condition of housing

And this is what it is in between them

So what is life in Mukuru like just talking briefly

Five hundred and fifty people use one single water tap

and pay nine times more

than what anybody else in the city could pay

simply because there is no water infrastructure

and water is sold

Many come back from work to find out that their houses do not exist

because they have either been bulldozed

or they have been burned down

So tired of this situation

a local slum dwellers' federation called Muungano

decided to do something about it

In four years

they organized  residents to collect data

map structures and put it together

And the plan was very simple 

they only needed four things

They wanted clean water

toilets decent roads

and most importantly not to be evicted

So they presented this with the government of Nairobi

And for the first time in history ever

a city has agreed to do it

The city of Nairobi the government of Kenya

declared Mukuru to be a special planning area

which means that people could come up with their own plan

People could decide to come up with their own norms and standards

because the standards that work for the formal citizens

do not work in informal settings

So what does that mean to give us an instance

If these are roads in Mukuru

you can see that there are houses along both sides of the road

Now in order to bring in a city bus

as per the standards

planners would have gone for a luxurious meterwide road

Now that would mean displacing [] percent of the structures 
[]
that's a lot of people

So instead of doing that we came up with a meterwide road

which had the structures intact and brought the city bus

without compromising on much services

In another instance let's talk about community toilets

You know in highdensity areas

where there is no scope for individual toilets

like the public toilets that we have here

So we would go for a male section and a female section

But imagine this situation

In the morning rush hours to the toilet

when everybody is in intense pressure to relieve themselves

and if you're standing in a queue of  people

and there is a child standing behind an adult

who wins

Children end up squatting outside

And that's why women decided

to come up with a separate squatting area for children

Now who could have thought of something like that

The idea here is that when poor people choose

they choose better

They choose what works for them

So choice is everything

And power decides choice

And we need those in power 

politicians leaders governments

architects planners institutions researchers 

and all of us in our everyday lives to respect choices

Instead of choosing what is right for people for the poor

let's acknowledge and empower their choices

And that is how we can build

better and inclusive cities for tomorrow

completing the imagery of cities

built by the choices of its own people

Thank you

Applause

If you happened to be in the town of Lubec Maine

in July of 

you may have seen something a little curious on the horizon

when you looked out across the bay

In the distance

on an otherwise uninhabited island

loomed large black letters that spelled the word FOREVER

The sign was  feet tall and  feet wide

large enough so that on a clear day you really could see FOREVER

the word perfectly visible and legible in the distance

But on some days

a thick white fog would roll in off the ocean

erasing the word and the view altogether

And sometimes like in this video

you could barely see FOREVER peeking out of the shifting fog

accompanied only by the rhythmic warning sounds of fog horns

Sound of fog horn

Sound of fog horn

It started out as a fairly simple idea

albeit a little strange

to put the word FOREVER in the landscape

so it could appear and disappear in the fog

But it took over a year to plan and execute

and it required the help of so many people

like the lobster boat captain

who helped transport all of the materials to the island

And the volunteers who helped carry thousands of pounds of wood and steel

to the top of the hill through waisthigh shrubs

And in the end

FOREVER only lasted for three weeks

Laughter

So if you're wondering why I did it at all

as I often did during that process

it might help for you to know a little bit more about me

and my upbringing

I grew up in an evangelical Christian family

And although I'm an atheist today

I've realized that my religious upbringing

has played a really important role in shaping the person that I've become

In  when I was five years old

my parents became missionaries to South Africa

And that was during the last few years of the apartheid

so we lived in an allwhite neighborhood

and I attended an allwhite public school

while my parents helped found a multiracial church

in downtown Cape Town

Because I was so young

it was impossible for me to understand

the magnitude of what was happening in South Africa at that time

I witnessed the racism and oppression of people of color I knew and loved

on a daily basis

but because of my own skin color

there was no way I could fully comprehend it

But I had the privilege to experience firsthand

one of the most influential social movements of the th century

And the thing that left a longlasting impression on me

was how the people I met in South Africa

could envision a better future for themselves and their country

A future they really believed was possible

And then they worked together relentlessly for decades

until they achieved that extraordinary historic change

I was there to see Nelson Mandela released from prison

and I watched an entire country begin a major transformation

And that transformed me as a person

It instilled in me a sense of wonder and optimism

and possibility that permeates everything I create

I make sculptures like FOREVER

as a way of giving physical tangible forms to language and time

Those powerful but invisible forces

that shape the way we perceive and experience our realities

And in doing so I try to give other people the opportunity

to reflect on their own perception of reality

and inspire them to wonder and imagine

what else might be possible

I often use signs to do this

because of how simply and effectively they're able to grab our attention

and communicate information

They often point out things we would otherwise overlook

like this sign on the side of the highway in Texas

[TEMPTATIONS]
[]
They can often signify things that we can't see at all

like the distance to our destination

Signs often help to orient us in the world

[You are on an island]
[]
by telling us where we are now

and what's happening in the present moment

but they can also help us zoom out

shift our perspective

and get a glimpse of the bigger picture

Imagine for example

you're walking down the street in Philadelphia

A city in the US that contains so much history

the birthplace of our constitution

But imagine you're walking down the street

in an area that's undergoing a huge transformation

due to gentrification

And as you walk down that street

you notice something flashing up above you

So you look up and you see this

A flashing neon sign that says

All the light you see is from the past

and then All you see is past

before turning off completely for a brief moment

It asks you to stop and notice

the history embedded in everything that you see

And it reminds you

that because light takes time to travel across space

even from just across the street or across the room

everything you're seeing in the present moment

is technically an image of the past

Signs influence the way we all navigate the world

which means they have the ability to create

a collective experience or understanding

My time in South Africa taught me

that when people are able to find common ground

and work together towards a mutual goal

powerful things can happen and so much more becomes possible

And I want to create more opportunities

for people to find that kind of common ground

I want people to feel the power of collaboration

sometimes quite literally

A few years ago

a friend of mine showed me

how our bodies can safely conduct small amounts of electricity

And if you hold hands with another person

a small electrical current can pass through your held hands

and become like a switch that can trigger something else to happen

So last year I used that form of human connection

to activate an inflatable sculpture

I put two sensors on a platform far enough apart

so that one person can't make it work on their own

But when two or more people work together

to complete that electrical circuit

the inflatable comes to life

And it begins to fill with air

and the longer people hold hands the larger it becomes

expanding into the words You are magic

Music birds chirping

I always love to see

how each group of people finds a different way

to bridge that physical and metaphorical divide

But as soon as they release their hands and break that connection

the words immediately begin to slouch and fall over

and eventually return to a lifeless pile of fabric on the ground

Applause

At this moment in time I think we could all agree

that the future feels pretty bleak and uncertain

But maybe the hope

for a brighter more sustainable more equitable future

depends first on our ability to imagine it

But after we imagine it

we actually have to believe it's possible

And then we have to find common ground

with people we would maybe otherwise disagree with

and work together towards that mutual goal

And if we do that I believe we have the capacity for magic

So if you can humor me for one more minute

I'm going to ask everyone in this theater to hold hands

When was the last time you held hands with a stranger

Laughter

And if you feel comfortable

go ahead and make that metaphorical gesture

of reaching across the aisle

And after you've held hands with people on either side of you

if you feel comfortable please close your eyes

Now take a minute to imagine what you want

what you want the future to look like

And give yourself permission to be at least a little bit idealistic

What do you want to see change or happen in your own life as an individual

What do you want to see change or happen for everyone for the planet

Can you picture it

And can you start to see how if we all worked together

it might actually be possible

Now open your eyes

and let's make it real

Thank you

Applause

Everyone has a story

and that story is filled with chapters

that have made us who we are today

Those early chapters of that story

sometimes are the ones that define us the most

The Center for Disease Control

has estimated that over half of our nation's children

have experienced at least one or two types of childhood trauma

That adversity can have lasting effects

When I began to have opportunities to speak

and advocate for students and for teachers

I found myself uniquely positioned

to be able to speak about childhood trauma

But I had to make a decision first

I had to decide

did I want to just share the bright and shiny parts of my life

you know those ones that we put out on social media

that make us all look perfect

or did I want to make myself vulnerable

and become an open book

The choice became very clear

In order to make a difference in the life of a child

I had to become transparent

So I made the commitment to tell my personal story

And this story is filled with people that have loved me

and taken care of me and grown me

And have helped me overcome and heal

And now it's time for me to help others do the same

When I first started school I was the picture of normalcy

I was from a good family

I was always dressed nicely

had a smile on my face

I was prepared for school

But my life was anything but normal

By this time I had already become a victim of sexual abuse

And it was still happening

My parents didn't know

and I had not told anyone else

When I started school I felt like this was going to be my safe place

So I was excited

Imagine my dismay when I met my teacher

Mr Randolph

Now Mr Randolph was not my abuser

But Mr Randolph was the epitome

of everything that scared me the most in my life

I had already started these selfpreservation techniques

to where I took myself out of positions where I was going to be alone with a man

And here I was as a student

I was going to be in a classroom with a man every day

for a year of school

I was scared I didn't trust him
 
But you know what

Mr Randolph would turn out to be my greatest advocate

But in the beginning

oh I made sure he knew I did not like him

I was noncompliant

I was that kid that was disengaged

And I also made it really hard on my parents too

I didn't want to go to school

so I fought them every morning getting on the bus

At night I couldn't sleep

because my anxiety was so high

So I was going into class exhausted

Which exhausted children are cranky children

and they're not easy to teach

you know that

Mr Randolph could have approached me with frustration

like so many teachers do with students like me

But not him

He approached me with empathy

and with flexibility

I was so grateful for that

He saw this sixyearold was tired and weary

And so instead of making me go outside for recess

he would let me stay in and take naps

because he knew I needed rest

Instead of sitting at the teacher table at lunch

he would come and sit with the students at the student table

He would engage me and all my classmates in conversation

And I now look back and I know

he had a purpose for that

he was listening he was asking questions

He needed to find out what was going on

He built a relationship with me

He earned my trust

And slowly but surely

those walls that I had built around myself

he started chipping away at

and I eventually realized he was one of the good guys

I know that he felt like he wasn't enough

Because he made the move to talk to my mom

And got my mom's permission

to let me start seeing a school guidance counselor

Ms McFadyen
Mcfadyen
I started seeing Ms McFadyen once or twice a week

for the next two years

It was a process

During that time period

I never disclosed to her the abuse

because it was a secret

I wasn't supposed to tell

But she connected the dots I know she did

because everything that she did with me

was to empower me and help me find my voice

She taught me how to use mental images

to push through my fears

She taught me breathing techniques

to help me get through those anxiety attacks

that I would have so often

And she roleplayed with me

And she made sure

that I could stand up for myself in situations

And the day came

where I was in the room with my abuser

and one other adult

And I told my truth

I told about the abuse

Immediately my abuser began to deny

and the person I disclosed to

they just weren't equipped to handle the bombshell

that I had just dropped on them

It was easier to believe the abuser

rather than a child

So I was told never to speak of it again

I was made to feel like I had done something wrong again

It was devastating

But you know what

something good came out of that day

My abuser knew that I was no longer going to be silent

The power shifted

And the abuse stopped

Applause

But the shame

and fear of it happening again

remained

And it would remain with me

for many many years to come

Mr Randolph and Ms McFadyen
RandolphMcfadyen
they helped me find my voice

They helped me find the light out

But you know what

there are so many kids that aren't as fortunate as me

And you have them in your classrooms

That is why it's so important for me to talk to you today

so you can be aware

and you can start asking the questions that need to be asked

and paying attention to these students

so you too can help them find their way

As a kindergarten teacher

I start my year off

with my kids making box biographies

These are two of my students

And I encourage them

to fill those boxes with things that tell me about them

and about their life

what's important to you you know

They decorate them

I mean they really take time

they fill them with pictures of their families and of their pets

and then I let them present them to me and to the class

And during that time I am an active listener

Because the things they say

the facial expressions that they give me

the things they don't say

can become red flags for me

and can help me figure out what their needs are

What is driving them

to maybe have the behaviors that they're showing me in class

How can I be a better teacher

by listening to their voices

I also make times to develop relationships with them

much like Mr Randolph did with me

I sit with them at lunch

I have conversations with them at recess

I go to their games on the weekends

I go to their dance recitals

I become a part of their life

Because in order to really know a student

you've got to infuse yourself into their lives

Now I know some of you are middle school teachers

and high school teachers

and you might think that those kids

have already kind of developed and you know

they're on autopilot at that point

But don't be deceived

Especially the kids that you think have it all together

because those are the ones that might need you the most

If you were to look at my yearbook

you would see me on about every page

because I was involved in everything

I even drove a school bus

Laughs

So I was that kid

that teachers thought was the overachiever

the popular person

the one that had it together

But guys I was lost

I was lost

and I wanted someone to ask me

Lisa why are you here all the time

why are you throwing yourself into all these things

Did they ever wonder

was I running away from someone

was I running away from something

Why did I not want to be in my community

or in my home

Why did I want to be at school all the time

No one ever asked

Now don't get me wrong

all overachievers in your schools

are not victims of abuse or trauma

But I just want you to take the time to be curious

Ask them why

You may find out that there is a reason behind it

You could be the reason that they move forward

with their story

Be careful not to assume

that you already know the ending to their story

Don't put a period where a semicolon should be

Keep that story going

and help them know that even if something has happened traumatic to them

that their life is still worth telling

Their story is worth telling

Now in order to do that

I really feel like we have to embrace our own personal stories as educators

Many of you might be sitting there

and thinking Yeah

That happened to me

But I'm not ready to share

And that's OK

The time will come

when you will feel it inside your soul

that it's time to turn your past pain

into purpose for the future

These children are our future

I just encourage you to take it day by day

Talk to someone

Be willing and just open

My life story came full circle

in the spring of 

where I was invited to speak

to a group of beginning teachers and mentors

I shared my story much like today with you

and afterwards I had a lady approach me

She had tears in her eyes and she quietly said Thank you

Thank you for sharing

I cannot wait to tell my dad

everything that I heard today

She must have seen the perplexed look on my face

because she followed up by saying

Mr Randolph is my dad

Audience Aww

Lisa Godwin And he often wonders

Did he make a difference

Today I get to go home and tell him

'You definitely made a difference'

What a gift

What a gift

And that prompted me

to reach out to Ms McFadyen's daughter as well

and to share with her

what an impact Ms McFadyen had made
Mcfadyen
And I wanted her to know

I have advocated for more funding

for guidance counselors for school social workers

for psychologists for nurses

because they are so vital to the mental and physical health

of our children

I'm thankful for Ms McFadyen
Mcfadyen
Applause

I once heard someone say

in order to find your way out of the darkness

you have to find the light

Today I hope that you leave this place

and you seek opportunities to be the light

For not only students

but for adults in your classrooms

in your schools in your communities

You have the gift

to help someone navigate

through their trauma

and make their story worth telling

Thank you

Applause

Transcriber Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez
Joseph Geni ReviewerCamille Mart  nez
OK I would like to introduce all of you beautiful curiousminded people

to my favorite animal in the world

This is the Peter Pan of the amphibian world

It's an axolotl
Axolotl
It's a type of salamander

but it never fully grows up and climbs out of the water

like other salamanders do

And this little guy has XManstyle powers right
X
So if it loses any limb

it can just completely regenerate

It's amazing

And I mean look at it  it's got a face with a permanent smile

Laughter

It's framed by feathery gills

It's just  how could you not love that

This particular type of axolotl a very close relative
Axolotl
is known as an achoque

It is equally as cute

and it lives in just one place in a lake in the north of Mexico

It's called Lake Ptzcuaro

and as you can see

it is stunningly beautiful

But unfortunately it's been so overfished and so badly polluted

that the achoque is dying out altogether

And this is something that's a scenario that's playing out all over the world

We're living through an extinction crisis

and species are particularly vulnerable when they're evolutionarily tailored

to just one little niche or maybe one lake

But this is TED right
TED
So this is where I give you the big idea the big solution

So how do you save one special weird species from going extinct

Well the answer at least my answer

isn't a grand technological intervention

It's actually really simple

It's that you find people who know all about this animal

and you ask them and you listen to them

and you work with them if they're up for that

So I want to tell you about how I've seen that in science

and in conservation in particular

if scientists don't team up with local people

who have really valuable knowledge

but a practical wisdom that's not going to be published in any academic journal

they can really miss the point

Scientists and science as an enterprise can fall at the first hurdle

if it rushes in knowing that it's the experts that know best

But when scientists shake off those academic constraints

and really look to people who have a totally different

but really important perspective on what they're trying to do

it can genuinely save the world

one wonderfully weird amphibian at a time

So in the case of the achoque

these are the people you need on your team

Laughter

These are the Sisters of the Immaculate Health

They are nuns who have a convent in Ptzcuaro they live in Ptzcuaro

and they have a shared history with the achoque

And it is so mindbogglingly wonderful

that it drew me all the way there to make an audio documentary about them

and I even have the unflattering selfie

to prove it

There is a room at the center of their convent though

that looks like this

It's very strange

It's lined with all these tanks full of fresh water

and hundreds of achoques

And that's because this creature because of its regenerative abilities

it's believed has healing powers if you consume it

So the sisters actually make and sell a medicine using achoques

I bought a bottle of it

So this is it

It tastes a bit like honey

but the sisters reckon it is good

for all kinds of particularly respiratory ailments

So I just want you to have a listen if you will to a clip of Sister Ofelia

Audio Sister Ofelia speaks in Spanish

Audio Interpreter voiceover Our convent was founded by Dominican nuns

here in Ptzcuaro in 
P  tzcuaro
Sometime after that

our sisters started to make the achoque syrup

We didn't discover the properties of the achoque

That was the original people from around here since ancient times

But we then started to make the syrup too

The locals knew that

and they came to offer us the animals

Audio Victoria Gill I see

So the achoques are part of making that syrup

What does the syrup treat and what is it for

Audio SO speaks in Spanish
SO
Audio Interpreter voiceover It's good for coughs asthma

bronchitis the lungs and back pain

Audio VG And so you've harnessed that power
VG
in a syrup in a medicine

Can you tell me how it's made

You're shaking your head and smiling Laughter
 
VG Yeah they're not up for sharing the centuriesold secret recipe

Laughter

But the decline in the achoque

actually nearly put a halt to that medicine production altogether

which is why the sisters started this

It's the world's first achoque farm

All they wanted was a healthy sustainable population

so that they could continue to make that medicine

but what they created at the same time

was a captive breeding program for a critically endangered species

And fast forward a few years

and these scientists that you can see in this picture

from Chester Zoo all the way over the in UK

not far from where I live

and from Michoacana University in Morelia in Mexico
Michoacana
have persuaded the sisters  it took years of careful diplomacy 

to join them in a research partnership

So the nuns show the biologists

how you rear perfectly healthy very robust Ptzcuaro achoques
P  tzcuaro
and the scientists have put some of their funding

into tanks filters and pumps

in this strange incongruous but amazing room

This is the kind of partnership that can save a species

But I don't think I see enough of this sort of thing

and I have been ludicrously lucky in my job

I've traveled to loads of places and just basically followed around

brilliant people who are trying to use science to answer big questions

and solve problems

I've hung out with scientists who have solved the mystery

of the origin of the menopause by tracking killer whales

off the north Pacific coast

And I've followed around scientists

who've planted cameras in Antarctic penguin colonies

because they were looking to capture the impacts of climate change

as it happens

But it's this team that really stuck with me

that really showed me the impact

that these delicate but really important relationships can have

And I think the reason that it stuck with me as well

is because it's not common

And one of the reasons it's not common

is because our traditional approach

of the hierarchical system of academic achievement

doesn't exactly encourage the type of humility

where scientists will look to nonscientists

and really ask for their input

In fact I think we have a bit of a tradition

especially in the West

of a kind of academically blinkered hubris

that has kept science historically an enterprise for the elite

And I think although that's moved on

it continues to be its downfall on occasion

So here's my example from history

and my takedown of a scientific hero

Sir Ernest Shackleton

and his TransAntarctic Expedition more than a century ago

the celebrated illfated adventure

On his way there

Shackleton just didn't listen to the whalers in South Georgia

They knew that region and they told him you won't get through the ice this year

It's too widespread it's too far north it's too dangerous

And look what happened

I mean granted that great adventure

that story of heroic leadership that we still tell

where he saved every single one of his men

we wouldn't be telling that story if he'd just hightailed it for home

and taken their advice

But it cost him his ship

I would imagine quite a lot of cold injuries among the team

a good few cases of PTSD

and Mrs Chippy the ship's cat had to be shot

because the team couldn't afford any extra food as they fought to survive

Now that was all a very long time ago

but as I've prepared for this talk

I've revisited some of the stories that I have covered

where these really unusual collaborations made a real positive difference

So I spoke to former poachers

whose knowledge of where they used to hunt illegally

is now really important in conservation projects

in those same places

And I spoke to an amazing artist

whose own experience of mental health struggles

has actually paved the way for him to take a role in designing and creating

a new really innovative and beautiful mental health ward in a hospital

Most recently I worked here in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

with a team of scientists that have been working there for decades

One of their experiments growing crops in that area

has now turned into this

It's Chernobyl's first vodka

Laughter

It's pretty good too I've tasted it
 
And this is actually although it looks like a niche product

it's set to be the first consumer product to come out of the exclusion zone

since the nuclear accident

And that's actually the result of years of conversation

with local communities who still live on the periphery of that abandoned land

and want to know when they can  and if they can  safely grow food

and build businesses and rebuild their communities and their lives

This was a product of humility

of listening

and I saw that in spades when I visited Ptzcuaro

So I watched as a decadesexperienced conservation biologist

called Gerardo Garcia
  
listened and watched super carefully

as a nun in a full habit and wimple and latex gloves

showed him how if you tap an achoque on the head really gently

it'll open its mouth so you can quickly get a DNA swab with a Qtip
QtipDNA
Laughter

When scientists team up with look to and defer to people

who have a really valuable perspective on what they're trying to do

but a totally different outlook

something really special can happen

Now there is a truly global and a very very ambitious example of this

called the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services

Now that is not a snappy title but stick with me

This organization includes more than  countries

and it's aiming to do nothing less than assess the state of the natural world

across our entire planet

So it recently published this global assessment

on the state of nature

and that could be the foundation for an international agreement

where all of those nations could sign up to finally take action

to tackle the biodiversity crisis that's happening on planet Earth

right now

Now I know from trying to communicate trying to report on reports like this

on assessments like this for a broad audience

that these big international groups can seem so highlevel

as to be kind of out of reach and nebulous

but there's a group of human beings at the center of them

the report's authors

who have this formidable task of bringing together

all of that biological and ecological information

that paints a clear and accurate picture

of the state of the natural world

And  years before this panel even set out to do that

to put that assessment together

they created what's called a cultural concept framework

This is essentially a cultural concept translation dictionary

for all of the different ways that we talk about the natural world

So it formally recognizes for example

that Mother Earth and nature means the same thing

And what that means is that Indigenous and local knowledge

can be brought into the same document

and given the weight and merit that it deserves

in that assessment of what state our natural environment is in

And that is absolutely critical

because an Inuit hunter might never publish in an academic journal

but I'll bet you she knows more about the changes to her home Arctic community

because of climate change

than a scientist who spent many years going to and from that region

taking measurements

And collectively Indigenous people are the caretakers

of an estimated  percent of the entire global land surface

including some of the most biodiverse places on the planet

So imagine how much we're missing

if we don't cross those cultural boundaries

or at least try to

when we're trying to figure out how the world works

and how to protect it

Every single research proposal is a new opportunity to do exactly that

So what if every time a research project was proposed

it had to include a suggestion of a person or a group of people 

local farmers Indigenous community leaders nuns 

that researchers wanted to bring into the fold

invite into their team and listen to

I just want to let Sister Ofelia give her view

of why she is so particularly driven and dedicated

to the survival of the achoque

Audio VG Sister Ofelia do you think that saving this species from extinction
VGOfelia
is that part of your work for God

Audio SO speaks in Spanish
SO
Audio Interpreter voiceover It's the responsibility

of every human being

not to harm those who live around us

That's all living things

We're all created not only just to survive but to be happy and to make others happy

All of us here are providing happiness by protecting this animal

and we're also making Him happy

Audio Nuns singing

VG I feel like I should sort of slink off and let the nuns sing me out
VG
because it sounds so lovely

But did you hear that

We're providing happiness

Now that's not a protocol you'd ever see outlined

in any formal research project proposal 

Laughter

but it's the impetus behind what's become the most successful breeding program

in the world

of an animal that was on the very brink of being wiped out

And isn't that just wonderful

Thank you

Applause

[As of the morning February  
[
there were at least  confirmed cases worldwide of the coronavirus
 
and  deaths from it

TED invited Dr David Heymann to share the latest findings about the outbreak]
]
[What happens if you get infected with the coronavirus]
[]
This looks like a very mild disease like a common cold

in the majority of people

There are certain people who get infected and have very serious illness

among them are health workers

It's a very serious infection in them

as they get a higher dose than normal people

and at the same time they have no immunity

So in the general population

it's likely that the dose of virus that you receive when you are infected

is much less than the dose that a health worker would receive

health workers having more serious infections

So your infection would be less serious hopefully

So that leaves the elderly and those with comorbidities

to really be the ones that we have to make sure

are taken care of in hospitals

[Who are the people who should be most concerned about this]
[]
Well the most concerned are people

who are first of all in developing countries

and who don't have access to good medical care

and may not have access at all to a hospital

should an epidemic occur in their country

Those people would be at great risk

especially the elderly

Elderly in all populations are at risk

but especially those who can't get to oxygen

In industrialized countries

it's the very elderly who have comorbidities

who have diabetes who have other diseases

who are at risk

The general population doesn't appear to be at great risk

[What preexisting medical conditions put people at higher risk]
[]
First of all

pulmonary disease existing as a comorbidity is also important

In general the elderly are at greater risk

especially those over 

because their immune systems are not as effective

as they might have once been

and they are more susceptible to infections

In addition in some instances in China

there's been a coinfection with influenza

and at the same time

there have been some bacterial superinfections

on the pneumonias that are occurring

[Where can we find uptodate information]
[]
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta keeps track

and has updates on a regular basis on its website

Also the World Health Organization in Geneva

which is coordinating many of the activities

going on internationally

also has a website with daily updates

It's our responsibility to get that information as individuals

so we understand

and can make sure that we can contribute in our own way

to prevention of major spread

[You led the global response to the SARS outbreak in 
[SARS
How does this outbreak compare]
]
That's the same problem with all new infections

This is an infection that's coming to humans

who have never been exposed to this virus before

They don't have any antibody protection

and it's not clear whether their immune system

can handle this virus or not

This is a virus that usually finds itself in bats or in other animals

and all of a sudden it's in humans

And humans just don't have experience with this virus

But gradually

we are beginning to learn a lot as we did with SARS
SARS
And you know there are certainly a larger number of deaths

than there were with SARS

But when you divide that by a denominator of persons who are infected

there are many many more persons infected than there were with SARS
SARSSARS
The case fatality ratio

that is the ratio of deaths to the numbers of cases in SARS
SARS
was about  percent

With the current coronavirus COVID
COVID
it is two percent or probably less

So it's a much less virulent virus

but it's still a virus that causes mortality

and that's what we don't want entering human populations

[Have we responded adequately at border crossings such as airports]
[]
It's clearly understood that airports or any land borders

cannot prevent a disease from entering

People in the incubation period can cross that border

can enter countries

and can then infect others when they become sick

So borders are not a means of preventing infections from entering a country

by checking temperatures

Borders are important because you can provide to people arriving

from areas that might be at risk of having had infection

provide them with an understanding

either a printed understanding or a verbal understanding

of what the signs and symptoms are of this infection

and what they should do if they feel that they might be infected

[What's the timeline for a vaccine]
[]
Vaccines are under development right now

there's a lot of research going on

That research requires first that the vaccine be developed

then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals

who are challenged with the virus after they are vaccinated

and then it must go into human studies

The animal studies have not yet begun

but will soon begin for certain vaccines

And it's thought that by the end of the year

or early next year

there may be some candidate vaccines

that can then be studied for licensing by regulatory agencies

So we're talking about at least a year until there's vaccine available

that can be used in many populations

[What questions about the outbreak are still unanswered]
[]
It's clear we know how it transmits

we don't know how easily it transmits in humans

in communities or in unenclosed areas

We know for example

that in the enclosed area of a cruise ship it spread very easily

We need to better understand

how it will spread once it gets into more open areas

where people are exposed to people who might be sick

[What about the global response could be improved]
[]
A major problem in the world today is that we look at outbreaks

in developing countries

as something that we need to go and stop

So when there's an outbreak of Ebola

we think How can we go and stop this outbreak in the country

We don't think about How can we help that country

strengthen its capacity

so that it can detect and respond to infections

So we haven't invested enough

in helping countries develop their core capacity in public health

What we've done is invested in many mechanisms globally

which can provide support to other countries

to go and help stop outbreaks

But we want to see a world where every country

can do its best to stop its own outbreaks

[Will we see more emerging disease outbreaks in the future]
[]
Today there are over seven billion people

And when those people come into the world

they demand more food

they demand a whole series of things

and they live closer together

In fact we're an urban world where people live in urban areas

And at the same time we're growing more animals

and those animals are contributing food to humans as well

So what we see

is that that animalhuman interface is becoming closer and closer together

And this intensive agriculture of animals

and this intensive increase in human populations

living together on the same planet

is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur

We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks

So an emerging infection today is just a warning

of what will happen in the future

We have to make sure

that that technical collaboration in the world

is there to work together

to make sure that we can understand these outbreaks when they occur

and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them

[Is the worst behind us]
[]
I can't predict with accuracy

So all I can say is that we must all be prepared

for the worstcase scenario

And at the same time

learn how we can protect ourselves and protect others

should we become a part of that epidemic

[To learn more visit Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Thirteen point eight billion years ago

the universe as we know it began with a big bang

and everything that we know and are and are made of was created

Fifty thousand years ago

our brains underwent a major genetic mutation

which resulted in the biological reorganization of the brain

Some scientists call this The Big Brain Bang

Others call it The Great Leap Forward

which I prefer

It's so much more poetic

This is when Homo sapiens began to evolve into the modern species that we are today

The Great Leap Forward activated most of our modern abilities

abstract thought planning

cooking competitive labor

language art music

and selfdecoration

After the Great Leap Forward

there was an explosion of stone toolmaking

more sophisticated weaponry

and  years ago

the creation of our first sophisticated markmaking on the cave walls of Lascaux
Lascaux
It's not a coincidence that we've gone from documenting our reality

on the cave walls of Lascaux

to the walls of Facebook

And in a very meta experience

you can now a book a trip to see the walls of Lascaux

on the walls of Facebook
Facebook
Approximately  years ago

men and women began to array themselves with makeup

They started to selfdecorate

But this wasn't for seductive purposes this was for religious convictions
 
We wanted to be more beautiful purer cleaner

in the eyes of something or someone

that we believed had more power than we did

There is no culture

in recorded human history

that has not practiced some form of organized worship

which we now call religion

Six thousand years ago in an effort to unite people

our ancestors began to design telegraphic symbols to represent beliefs

and to identify affiliations

These symbols connected likeminded people

and they are all extraordinary

These affiliations allowed us to feel safer and more secure in groups

and the sharing created consensus around what the symbols represented

With these marks you knew where you fit in

both for the people that were in the in crowd

and those as importantly that were excluded

These symbols were created in what I consider to be a very bottomup manner

they were made by people for people

and then shared for free among people

to honor the higher power that they ascribed to

What's ironic is that the higher power actually had nothing to do with this

These early affiliations

they often shared identical characteristics

which is rather baffling

given how scattered we were all over the planet

We constructed similar rituals practices and behaviors

no matter where we were anywhere on the globe

We constructed rituals to create symbolic logos

We built environments for worship

We developed strict rules on how to engage with each other

with food with hair

with birth with death

with marriage and procreation

Some of the symbols have eerie commonalities

The hand of God shows up over and over and over again

It shows up as the hamsa hand in Mesopotamia

It shows us as the hand of Fatima in Islam

It shows up as the hand of Miriam in Judaism

Now when we didn't agree on what our beliefs and behaviors were

in regards to others

if we felt that somebody else's were incorrect

we began to fight

and many of our first wars were religious

Our flags were used on the battlefield

to signify which side of the battlefield we belonged to

because that was the only way to be able to tell friend from foe

We all looked alike

And now our flags are on massmanufactured uniforms

that we are making

Logos on products to identify a maker came next

and brands were given legal recognition on January  

with the advent of the Trademarks Registration Act

The first trademarked brand was Bass Ale
Bass Ale
and I kind of wonder what that says about our humanity

that first trademarked brand was an alcoholic beverage

Now here is what I consider to be

the first case of branded product placement

There are bottles of Bass Ale behind me

with the logo accurately presented here

in this very famous painting in  by douard Manet

One of the most widely recognized logos in the world today

is the Nike swoosh

which was introduced in 

Carolyn Davidson a graphic design student

originally created the logo for  dollars

Upon seeing it Nike CEO Phil Knight stated

I don't love it

but maybe it will grow on me

Maybe it will grow on me

But why is the swoosh so popular
swoosh
Why is the swoosh so popular
swoosh
Is it the mark

Or is the marketing

And what can we make of the fact

that the Nike swoosh seems to be

the Newport logo upside down

or the Capital One logo on its side

That is not the only logo with a shared identity

This next logo is a logo that has a shared identity

with wholly different meanings

As a Jewish person

I believe that this logo

this swastika

is the most heinous logo of all time

But it actually has a rather surprising trajectory

The word swastika originally comes from

the ancient Sanskrit word svastika
svastika
which actually means good fortune

luck and wellbeing

In the early s before it was appropriated by Hitler

it was used by CocaCola

on a good luck bottle opener

The American Biscuit Company prominently registered the mark

and put it on boxes of cookies

The US Playing Card Company registered the mark in 

for Fortune Playing Cards

The Boy Scouts used the mark on shoes in 

and the symbol was also featured on cigar labels boxtops road signs

and even poker chips

Even the Jain made use of the logo along with a hand of God

many millennia ago

These marks were identical

but with use as a Nazi symbol

the impact became very very different

The hand of God

the Nike swoosh

and the swastika

they all demonstrate how we've been manufacturing meaning with visual language

over millennia

It's a behavior that's almost as old as we are

Today in the United States

there are over  malls

and they all look pretty much the same

There are more than  supermarkets

and they each have over  items

If you went shopping for bottled water

you'd have over  options to choose from

Since their launch in 

you could choose from over  flavors and variants of Oreo cookies

Now is this a good thing

or is it a bad thing

Is a plethora of choice necessary in a free market

I believe it is both a good and bad thing

as humans are both good and bad

and we're the ones creating and using and buying these brands

However I think that the question

of whether this behavior is good or bad is actually secondary

to understanding why 

why we behave this way in the first place

Here's the thing

every one of our massmarketed products

are what I consider to be topdown brands

They're still created by people

but they are owned operated manufactured advertised

designed promoted and distributed by the corporation

and pushed down and sold to the consumer for financial gain

These corporations have a responsibility to a P and L
PL
with an expectation of an ROI

and have names like P and G and AT and T and J and J
PGATTJJ
And that's pretty much the way it's been for the last couple of hundred years

a topdown model controlled by the corporation

Until 

That's when we began to see evidence

of real significant farreaching change

The Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street

proved how the internet could amplify messages

and connect likeminded people

with powerful beliefs to inspire change

We witnessed a cultural shift via social media

with hashtags like MeToo and BlackLivesMatter
MeTooBlackLivesMatter
In its wake the discipline of branding

has transformed more in the last  years

than it has in the last 

and for the first time in modern history

the most popular influential brands

are not brands being pushed down by the corporation

They are brands being pushed up by the people for the people

for the sole purpose of changing the world and making it a better place

Our greatest innovations aren't brands providing a different form

or a different flavor of our favorite snack

Our greatest innovations are the creation of brands

that can make a difference in our lives

and reflect the kind of world that we want to live in

In November of 

Krista Suh Jayna Zweiman and Kat Coyle

created a hat to be worn at the Women's March in Washington DC

Applause

This was the day after the presidential inauguration

Two months later on January  

millions of people all over the world wore handmade pink pussyhats

in support of the Women's March all over the world

The hat was not created for any financial benefit

Like our religious symbols created thousands of years ago

the hat was created by the people for the people

to serve what I believe is the highest benefit of branding

to unite people in the communication

of shared ideals

The pink pussyhat became a mark for a movement
Pussyhat
In a very short time two months

it became universally recognizable

It connected an audience in an unprecedented way

It is a brand

but it is more than that

Today the pink pussyhat is proof positive
Pussyhat
that branding is not just a tool of capitalism

Branding is the profound manifestation of the human spirit

The condition of branding has always reflected the condition of our culture

It is our responsibility

to continue to leverage the democratic power branding provides

and it is our responsibility

to design a culture that reflects

and honors

the kind of world we want to live in

Thank you

[This talk contains graphic language and descriptions of sexual abuse]

Can I get a show of hands who here has ever Googled themselves

I have

But what started off as momentary curiosity

very quickly turned

into an almost fiveyear horrific battle

that almost ruined my life

I Google Images reversesearched myself

a function of Google that allows you to upload an image
and it shows you where it is on the internet

This is me at  years old

An innocent selfie I took before a party

Now before I continue I must point out

that what I'm about to talk about is very confronting and graphic

But there's no way out

This is a very confronting issue
In a split second

my screen was flooded with that image

and dozens more images of me

that had been stolen from my social media

on links connected to porn sites

On these sites nameless faceless sexual predators

had published highly explicit sexual commentary about me
and what they'd like to do to me

Cover her face and we'd fuck her body

one person wrote

They also published identifying information about me

where I lived what I studied who I was
But things got worse

I soon discovered that these sexual predators

had doctored or photoshopped my face

onto the bodies of naked adult actresses engaged in sexual intercourse

on solo shots

of me being ejaculated on by two men
Sperm was edited onto my face

I was edited onto the cover of a porn DVD
DVD
Perpetrators had edited my images

to give the effect that my blouse was transparent or seethrough

so you could see my nipples

Perpetrators ejaculated on images of me

took photos of their sperm and penises on these images

and posted them onto porn sites

Cum on printed pigs is what they call it

Now you might be wondering

what sorts of images I posted on social media

This is me at around  at the Claremont Hotel

just a few suburbs away

And they superimposed that face into this

And things got worse

Nothing was off limits for these predators

They even posted an image with my little sister on these sites too

Now you might be thinking

Well you do dress provocatively

even a little sexually suggestive

attention seeking maybe

But just because a woman's body gets attention

doesn't mean she's attentionseeking

And what is provocative anyway what is sexually suggestive

In some parts of the world showing your ankles

is promiscuous is provocative

It's just like no matter what a woman wears

it's always perceived as more sexual than it is

For me I just wanted to feel pretty and confident

What's so wrong with that

Now you might be thinking

Well can't you just set your social media on private

Well these perpetrators were calculated

They befriended my friends on social media

under fake profiles

they followed the public galleries

of the events and places I regularly visited

But why

Why should one have to retreat and hide

out of fear that something like this could happen

What I post and what I wear

isn't an invitation to violate and abuse me

The only person that should be changing their behavior

is the perpetrators

Applause

Now you might be thinking why me

Well I'm just one

of the thousands upon thousands

of ordinary women who are being preyed upon

in these massscale horrific online cultures websites and threads

that are dedicated to sexually exploiting and doctoring

ordinary images of women into porn

As I speak

there are women who are being preyed upon and they don't even know it

In the beginning I tried seeking help

I went to police I contacted government agencies

I even tried to hire a private investigator

but they were too expensive

There was nothing that they could do

I mean what could you do

when the sites are hosted overseas and the perpetrators are from overseas

I was told I had to contact the sites one by one

notifying the webmasters to get everything deleted

And so as you can imagine

in complete and utter fear and pain

I did

I contacted the webmasters

requesting that they delete the material shared without consent

And I had some successes

but I also had some major setbacks

The more I fought

the more sites I would discover

and with time the more my images were being seen and shared

in the tens of thousands

I had one webmaster respond to me saying he'll only delete the site

if I sent him nude photos of myself within  hours

And this went on for years

fighting against these dodgy disgusting sites

But I was fighting a losing battle

And I couldn't continue this any longer for my own mental health

But what could I do

Maybe I thought if I spoke out

I could reclaim my name

and I could rewrite my narrative on my own terms

Maybe if I spoke out

I could raise awareness about this

Maybe I could even try to change the law

And so I did

Applause

I spoke out publicly late last year

and news of my story reverberated around the world

But this was the response

She's a fat ugly slut she's a whore

She's an attentionseeking piece of trash

Feel flattered baby it's a compliment

I was victimblamed and slutshamed

and told I was deserving of what happened to me

And quite frankly

that was more difficult for me to endure

than my actual experiences of imagebased abuse

But I couldnt let this criticism defeat me

I knew what the perpetrators had done was wrong

and I knew what they were doing to others was wrong

And so I petitioned

I sent out impassioned pleas for support

But it didn't work

I think I got like  signatures

And that was really disheartening

But I then contacted my state and federal MPs

And I was referred to the New South Wales Attorney General's department

who were already in the process of drafting new laws

to criminalize the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images

Imagebased sexual abuse

Some of you might know it as revenge porn

And soon I became a spokesperson

a public face for the new laws

But I must point out

I do not in any way shape or form

want to take credit for this change in the law

This is on the backs of cybersafety experts

of researchers of the Attorney General's department

of so many people who have fought for years

New South Wales was the first state in all the world

to specifically include a provision on altering images

Something that happened to me

something you certainly don't hear about very often

And now ACT has also criminalized this
ACT
also with a provision on altered images

And next year WA is introducing legislation

and hopefully they introduce a provision on altered images

and I urge every state and every country in this world to follow suit

because right now

there's no justice for people like me

Despite it all

despite the hate and despite the criticism

despite the fact that I'm never going to get justice

because my experiences happened before this movement of law reform

speaking out was the best thing I've ever done

because I know for a fact that it has helped people

And I just want to live in a world

where regardless of what I wear or what I post

that I'm still worthy of being treated with dignity and respect

Respect

Now that's an idea worth sharing

Applause

Thank you

Often when I'm out in public

a child will stare at me

And if the child is particularly brave they'll approach me and ask

Are you a pirate

Laughter

To which I then need to respond

once again

Yes

Laughter

I mean let's be honest

I've got two hooks prosthetic legs and a penchant for hard liquor

Laughter

All I need is an eyepatch and a parrot and I'm basically there

Laughter

But I like being a pirate

I find many advantages to having a disability

and I'm not just talking about the money I save on gloves 

Laughter

or the fantastically legitimate excuse for never having to master chopsticks

Laughter

I'm talking about real advantages I feel I've gained

having gone through physical adversity

When I was  I contracted a disease

that resulted in the loss of both my arms at the elbows

both my legs below the knee

and left enough scars on my face to elicit jealousy in Freddy Krueger

Laughter

Now I may never be able to communicate in sign language

but my increased resilience and general ability to problemsolve

has been heightened by being forced to think laterally

to overcome problems that most people aren't faced with

One of the first lessons that I learned

immediately followed the painful and arduous task

of learning how to walk again

but it went on to pay dividends for the rest of my life

It happened when I attempted to step up a curb

Now as rudimentary as this action sounds to most of you

stepping up a curb is somewhat of a challenge

for those of us without ankle movement

So I tried stepping up the curb

the way I'd always known how front on

for days on end

with no success

until it became obvious that the time and effort

I was investing into this endeavor was clearly disproportionate

to the benefit of its outcome

Laughter

So I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle

If I couldn't use an ankle joint

to achieve the range of motion that I required to mount the curb

I would have to use a different joint

like my hip

So I turned my body perpendicular to the curb

and placed my foot up sideways

and I was able to step up immediately

Within five minutes

no staircase was safe from my advances
Laughter

That very day I climbed a staircase of three flights

which I was quite impressed with as well

except I realized that I didn't know how to get back down again

Laughter

That was a long weekend

Laughter

Now in my past life as an ablebodied person
I'd been a guitarist

I was alright as a player

but I'd never really taken it further

I'd never really started a band or played live all that much

Nonetheless music was a great passion of mine

and when I lost my arms

the idea that it may no longer be a part of my life

critically challenged my will to keep living

However the thought that emerged

immediately after being discharged from hospital was

If Ray Charles can play the piano while blind as a bat

let's get to work on a solution for this guitar problem

So consulting with an engineer

I designed a slide system that would hook into my left hook

and I devised another pickholder system that would clip into my right hook

Now if this worked

I would be able to play the guitar open tuned on my lap like a slide

So after weeks of testing and alterations

I finally had the accessories back to play the guitar again

and I was right back where I was before losing my hands 

being issued with noise complaints from my neighbors obviously

Laughter

But this time I took it further

I started a band with my friends

We wrote songs and recorded them

We even played gigs to real people

Not as many as this

Laughter

But even though it was a just a tiny step

it was a giant leap from what I'd achieved when I was all in one piece

Now while relearning every action that one has ever cultivated

might seem like a significant undertaking 

and believe me it very much was in the short term 

it was nonetheless having a positive effect

on the way that I approached everything else in my life

Not only did it transform my ability to problemsolve

but I also felt I became more pragmatic

less sensitive to hindrances

in some cases more patient

and magically transformed people's abilities

to offer me their seats on public transport

Laughter

Trivial setbacks began to pale in comparison

to challenges I'd previously overcome

and this allowed me to take a calm and measured approach to these challenges

keeping them in perspective

and often even finding new and improved ways to overcome them

The benefit of not dwelling on the negative

and just getting on with the task at hand

became selfevident

It even encouraged me to pursue some more fulfilling career paths

that may otherwise have been inadvisable

And who would have thought that an appropriate job for me

might involve the meticulous operation of electronic equipment

to curate dance music to people in inaccessible places

under the influence of alcohol

Laughter

Not I

So in a competitive industry where DJs have been relentlessly honing their craft
DJ
desperate to attain gigs sending demos to clubs

my best friend and I took a different approach

and we started our own club night

and we employed ourselves as the DJs
DJ
Laughter

Suddenly we had a headline slot

Laughter

Now when we started that club night I could not DJ
DJ
The first time I ever got behind the decks was on our opening night

in front of hundreds of people

I'd only just learned where the play button was

Laughter

But being previously faced with so many ultimatums

one's forced to be astute in adapting to new situations

That club night went on to become

the longestrunning weekly club night in Sydney

and we as DJs went on to play Australia's biggest music festivals
DJ
So eventually I either learned quickly

or the standards of clubs have gone really downhill

Laughter

Coming close to death can be an educational experience

It's certainly true that one's priorities receive somewhat of a realignment

immediately afterwards

And it's also true that some of those priorities

are met with an increased sense of urgency

But another more salient realization that comes to light

is the triviality of our own selfimportance and selfconsciousness

To truly understand the extent to which your selfconsciousness

prohibits you from engaging in opportunities

should lead everyone to take risks they otherwise wouldn't

We're merely a blip on the time line of the universe right

Act accordingly

Now the ideas that I'm presenting today were imbued upon me

through some otherwise unfortunate circumstances granted

but they're lying dormant in the lives of anyone who's willing to exploit them

If we all understand that we all have unique weaknesses

and if we're honest about what they are

we can learn how to best take advantage of them

whether they be mounting a curb or fear of presenting sales reports

or the inability to sufficiently manage one's finances 

looking at that guy 

Laughter

there lies the ability to learn to adapt

and even the ability to rewire one's instinctual response to challenges

Adversity is good

and it has the potential to make you stronger

And at the very least

you can scare the hell out of kids if you look like a pirate

Thanks

Applause and cheers

Four years ago

a teenage girl changed my life

in one conversation

She was  years old

she was a friend's little cousin

and she casually told me

that she had met the man she was going to marry

So I said OK tell me about him

And she told me that his name was Harry Styles

Laughter

So I laughed a little like you

and then she said I know you don't think I'm serious

but I'm actually going to be with him

Because I love him so much

that I would slit someone's throat to be with him

Laughter

And that was the moment

that I became obsessed with fangirls

I didn't know it then

but that moment would transform the course of my life

and go on to change everything that I thought I knew

about being an adult

being a woman

and being truly happy

But before we get started

what is a fangirl

and what is a Harry Styles

Well according to the dictionary the MerriamWebster dictionary

a fangirl is a girl or woman

who is an extremely or overly enthusiastic fan

of someone or something

Technically you can have fangirls of anything

but my specific interest was in fangirls of boy bands

Because of their somewhat lethal reputation

I remember my dad had told me this story of some Beatles fans in the 's

who apparently had torn a parked BMW to literal pieces

because the band had supposedly just been sat in it

In the 's the Beatles were the biggest boy band on the planet

but when I met this girl in 

the biggest boy band on the planet was none other than One Direction

And Harry Styles was a member of One Direction

Harry Styles was reputed for his compassionate demeanor

and perfect hair

I learn this when I read thousands of tweets about him

I learn that he is a sweet cupcake

I learn that he is a perfect angel

I learn that one time

he vomited on the side of a freeway in California

and that within two hours

fans had turned the site of the vomit into a sacred shrine

Laughter

I scroll through 

Laughter

I scroll through fanmade paintings of Harry

baby photos of him

paintings of baby photos of him

I watch videos that show me how to make DIY love totems for Harry 
DIY
for example a lampshade covered in photos of his face

or a key ring that states the exact time of his birth

I read hours of fan fiction

and I fall down this specific rabbit hole

of stories that actually place me as a protagonist

inside of various imagined romances with him

So in one I tell him that I'm pregnant with his child

In another we meet in hospital where we're both fighting cancer

and in another we fall so deeply in love

that we become fugitives who kill people

Laughter

But then 

something unthinkable happens

One Direction the biggest boy band on the planet

loses a member

Zayn Malik quits the band

and the internet explodes with feels

I read tweets as these girls describe the physical pain of this loss

how they can't eat or sleep or walk

I read them describe how much Zayn had meant to them
Zayn
And I watch videos of yearold girls crying

But like really crying

And then I watch as people repost these videos but with new titles

that contain words like crazy and creepy and insane

And suddenly my YouTube sidebar contains
YouTube
Compilation Fans react to Zayn leaving
Zayn
Psycho alert

Then I watch as mainstream news outlets cover the story

I read them describe these young banshees

I read one journalist say

It's a commonly known fact since the age of the Beatles

that there is nothing scarier in this world

than a group of excited teenage girls

Laughter

And then I ask myself a question I've never considered in my life

Why is it that the image of young girls screaming their lungs out with excitement

for a pop star

is considered crazy psycho

scary a bit much

But the image of young boys screaming their lungs out for a footballer

is perfectly normal

Boys crying at the footie

that's the love of the game

Girls crying at a Justin Bieber concert

That's pathetic

And as soon as I realized this double standard

I realized that all of my curiosity about fangirls

had been sparked by exactly the same judgments

I too had suspected that they were a bit crazy

I'd looked at images of girls screaming for the Beatles

the Backstreet Boys One Direction

and the word that had come to mind was not excitement

but hysteria

And what I did not know was the history of that word

That in the th century

hysteria was considered to be a legitimate female mental disorder

that could be diagnosed by doctors

if women displayed excessive emotion or difficult behavior

The word hysterical comes from the Latin word hystericus

meaning of the womb

because it was thought that this condition was caused by a dysfunction of the uterus

And so a treatment for hysteria

was a hysterectomy

Which is what we still call a removal of the womb

And at this point

I decide to redeclare my obsession

Because I am no longer just obsessed with fangirls

Now I'm obsessed with the way that the world talks about fangirls

and the way that the world looks at young female enthusiasm

Because I want to know

if girls grow up in a world

where words like crazy and psycho and hysterical are casually used

to describe female enthusiasm

then how does that shape the way that those girls get to see themselves

And if girls grow up in a world that tells them

that they are designed just a bit crazier than the boys

then isn't that a little bit like telling them

that they are born less capable of rationality than men

less capable of reason

and unworthy of the same intellectual respect as their brothers

Separately I become obsessed with female screams

Not in a creepy way

I'm talking about like those shrieks and squeals

that fangirls let out at concerts

I want to know why it is

that some people instinctively flinch when I merely describe the sound

like it's painful just to think about it

Then I meet Amy Hume

She's a voice coach

And she blows my mind

Because she tells me that the female voice

between the ages of  and 

is one of the most interesting things to study

Why

Because there's this research by Carol Gilligan

that says that is the age

when girls begin to perform and alter their voices

For example adding breath for maturity

Imitating vocal fry or adding vocal fry for apathy

Laughter

But tell me according to this research

when do you reckon boys begin to perform and alter their voices

Now I guessed 

because men mature later right

Wrong

The answer was four years old

Because that is when boys learn not to cry or squeal

That those are not manly sounds

And that's when I realized

that a fangirl's shriek is therefore like a superpower

Laughter

Because it's this fearless and honest expression

of pure celebration and joy

and it's a sound

they have not forgotten how to make

I actually reckon that fangirls have a second superpower

because they know how to do something

that most of my adult friends have no idea how to do

Fangirls know how to love something without apology or fear

My years of researching fangirls

culminated in this determination

to write something that celebrates and vindicates them

So I decided to make this thriller comedy musical

that sounds like a Beyonc concert meets rave meets church

I called it Fangirls

and I designed it like a Trojan horse

So it appears to make fun of these young women

only to like smuggle them into your heart

Laughter

Thanks

Applause

At one point 

Thanks

At one point a girl sings

Why should I hide my feelings

Because they annoy you

Or because it isn't what the boys do

And as a former fangirl cynic

that is the question that I want to leave you all with

Why should fangirls tone it down

Because they're crazy

Or because our definition of reasonable

is based on what it is acceptable for men to do

What if we rethink the judgments we've been conditioned to feel

when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement

What if we decided to rethink the words we use

to describe that joy

and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls

with words that undermine their intelligence

their interests and their capability

Because according to my research

they are capable of building a shrine to Harry Styles's vomit

on the side of a freeway within two hours

Laughter

That takes some executive skills in logistics and communication

Laughter

If that isn't capable I don't know what is

Applause

I reckon instead of judging fangirls we can learn from them

We can all die tomorrow

so why not love things while we're still breathing

And with that

I'd like to ask you all to try something with me

Can I get you all to stand up

Stand up if you can stand up

Alright so here's what's going to happen

I'm going to count to three

and when I finish

I'm going to ask every single one of you

to let out your very best fangirl scream

Laughter

Yeah

Here is why I am asking you to do this

Because if all fiveorso thousand of you do this and really commit

we all get our first chance to hear that sound

and to decide that it is not a crazy sound

It is a hopeful sound

So shall we do this

I said shall we do this

Audience Yes

Alright OK I am going to cheat and I'm not going to go full volume
 
because I'm miked and we don't want to hear that

But it means you all have to go  percent

You ready Take a deep breath with me
 
Think of someone you love let's go

one two three

Audience screams

Laughter and applause

You all just sounded stunning

and as sane and as intelligent

and as dignified

as when you walked in this room

Thank you

Paleontology

a science geared towards small children

focused on digging up dinosaurs

while sporting a Jurassic Park costume

Skulls are popped out of the ground

and put on display for public gawking

The relevance of this beyond clickbait coloring books and monster movies

is unknown

No 

Wait

That's not paleontology at all

Paleontology is nothing less than the study of past life

All past life

From ancestors to alien forms

It involves fundamental questions like Who are we

And How did we get here 
 
using the broadest possible definition of we

life itself

Dinosaurs a category of birds

are just a small percentage of that

Laughter

Yet they get the most media attention

[The incredible diversity of ancient life Dinosaurs Paleontology]
[]
It's a very accurate meme I didn't even make this one
 
This is just the truth

Anyway most of us paleontologists consider dinosaurs to be a gateway drug

There is so much cooler stuff in the fossil record

and we know so much about it

Let's go on a brief dinosaurfree tour

of the last four billion years

Laughter

First up genetic material

Viruses basically started producing proteins

and wrecking their environment

The Earth was infected with life

Some of these new bacteria learned how to eat sunshine

producing oxygen

pulling in carbon from the air

and destroying the iron food of other microbes

by turning it into rust

This went on for billions of years

Some bacteria consumed other bacteria

gaining their power to turn oxygen into energy

becoming the precursors of animals and plants

But as a result there were climate shocks

from hot to cold and back again

which ended up turning the Earth into a snowball covered with glaciers

The technical term for this time period is Snowball Earth

Laughter

Seven hundred eight hundred million years ago

Anyway microbes banded together

creating multicellular life

Six hundred million years ago

geometric colonies appeared sucking microbes from the water

These were soon replaced by the ancestors of modern animals

The Cambrian explosion

Lobster relatives ate other animals

capturing them using their grasping arms

Armored wriggling clam worms crawled across the seafloor and into it

creating new ecosystems

Our tadpolelike ancestors flitted along ancient coastlines

while their eellike relatives with gnashing throat teeth

swam above the icecream cone corals of the first reefs

dodging schoolbussized krakens
krakens
and hungry sea scorpions

Plant fungus came onto land

But then the glaciers returned killing pretty much everything

But mass extinctions open opportunities

Jawless fishes invaded the ocean

sporting points prongs and finally fins

Spiders scorpions snails and worms came onto land

Somewhere around China a fish developed jaws

and its descendants drove jawless fishes

sea scorpions and branching plankton

to extinction

Some of these fishes

which had arm bones in their fins

sprouted fingers

seven or eight per flipper

On land plants became trees

growing massive

or spreading their spores only once before dying

But then the glaciers came back again

and it was mass extinction number two

It was the age of weird fishes and plated sea lilies

Sharks with wings

Sharks with buzz saw jaws

Sharks with fins covered in tiny teeth

Sharks with crushing tooth plates

Bony fishes that looked like modern angelfish and eels

for the first time

Wetlands developed

sporting tenfootlong millipedes and giant dragon flies

These spread across the supercontinent of Pangaea and died

creating coal

leading to a millionyear Ice Age

Finally vertebrates made it onto land on a permanent basis

leading to alligatorlike amphibians

and sabertoothed protomammals

But then volcanoes erupted all over Siberia

everything almost died

and it was mass extinction number three

Laughter

The day life nearly died

A single lonely tusked mammal survived and thrived

but it was soon replaced by galloping crocodiles

In the ocean marine reptiles

giant rafts made of the living relatives of sea urchins

and armored squids ammonoids of every kind and form

But then Pangaea started to split apart

forming a sea of lava

that would one day become the Atlantic Ocean

spewing toxic gas into the atmosphere

and mass extinction number four

Laughter

Yeah there's actually a lot more than these five

these are the big ones

Laughter

So finally there were whalesized fishes

and modern fishes mobbed corals

made gigantic by using their captured algae to eat sunshine

Crabs stingrays and other fishes with crushing teeth appeared

smashing shells

and leading to an arms race between predators and prey

There was an explosion of marine biodiversity

Mammals climbed trees flew

and did a lot of other things that are seemingly sort of modern

They were feeding on the first flowers pollinated by the first bees

There were ecological revolutions on land and at sea

leading to the modern world

Except that an asteroid hit Mexico

and then that triggered volcanoes on the other side of the world in India

and everything almost died again

Laughter

But  there's always a but because we're still here 

mammals arose from the ashes

became small under extreme heat and then ever larger

There were palm trees and snakes in the Arctic

Predatory deer dogs frolicked along ancient rivers

while their relatives returned to the ocean

to become the first otterlike whales

Not hyenas and other sort of carnivores

were chased off by giant longnecked rhinos

Everything at this point seems kind of familiar

but not really

In Antarctica an ice age started

forming the first permanent polar ice cap in two hundred million years

This dried out the rest of the world

but it allowed the rise of grasses of rodents of cats

Somewhere in Africa

an ape started walking across the new savannah

Oh and there were giant sabertoothed salmon

I just have to mention that

Laughter

So we know all of this happened

and so much more

How

Why

Paleontology is a thriving science

at the intersection of multiple other fields and technologies

There is no bigger data than the fossil record

and we mine every bit of it

We use CAT scans
CAT
we use isotopes

we use genomes

we use robots

we use mathematical simulations

and all kinds of analytics

We maximize all of it so that we can understand the past

and how evolution works

It also lets us make predictions for the future

What will happen after the next mass extinction

What weird things will show up

Will mammals get smaller again

Will there even be mammals

In sum

we have learned a lot about dinosaurs

But there's so much left to learn

from the other  percent of things that have ever lived

And that's paleontology

Thank you

Applause and cheers

My name is Joel

and I'm a coparent

So growing up I never heard the term coparent

I heard a lot of other things though

for starters absentee father

sperm donor 

that's a good one 

deadbeat dad

and my personal favorite baby daddy

Baby daddy for those not in the know

refers to an individual who helps to conceive a child

but does little else

Baby daddy is also someone who is not married by law

to the mother of said child

Growing up I thought coparent was reserved primarily for white families

that starred in Netflix primetime dramas
Netflix
Laughter

It still kind of does

But it wasn't used to explain the role of a parent Right
 
Either you had kids or you didn't

and no one in my social circles or at our dinner table

was having complex conversations about the role fathers played

in that conversation right

A more balanced open loving approach to parenting

was not something we were discussing within our social circles

A majority of the time

the fathers I knew of growing up were barely present

or just completely nonexistent

Coparent wasn't a term I heard or saw

where I grew up where I came from

I come from the hood

That hood would be Creston Avenue th in the Bronx

And for  one person that's what's up

Laughter

Appreciate that

For a lot of us in that hood

there was only one person you could already turn to

for food shelter warmth love discipline

our mothers

My mother who I playfully call Linda T
T
was my first example of real love

and what showing up as a healthy coparent looked like

She was a strong determined single mother

a woman who would have benefited greatly from having a secure and stable partner

as a coparent

So I vowed whenever I got married

my boo and I would be together forever

You know Laughs
 
We'd share the same bed and home

we'd sleep under the same covers we'd argue at IKEA  normal stuff

Laughter

My partner would feel seen and loved

and our children would grow up in a twoparent household

However things rarely ever end up how we plan them

Our daughter Lilah has never known a household with both of her parents

living together under one roof

Her mother and I were never married

We dated on and off for several months before we found out she was pregnant

Up until then my mother didn't even know she existed

I was ashamed

I was embarrassed

and at times I was suicidal

I was asking myself what was I doing Where was I going wrong
 
I never wanted the stigma or label

of what some identified as the stereotypical black father

So absentee confrontational combative not present

It took a lot of work time energy and effort

for us to finally realize

that maybe coparenting for us didn't need to mean a shared household

and wedding bells

that maybe just maybe

the way we showed up as coparents

lay not only in the layered nuances of our partnership

but the capacity within our hearts to tend to a human

that we helped create together

Applause

It would involve love in a nurturing and safe environment

that would feed Lilah long after we both left this earth

Fastforward four years

and Lilah is now in preK
K
She loves gummies

and she says things like My heart is filled with love

She's the most loving compassionate empathetic human being I know

and the reason I get to tell you all of this is because

she's back in the Bronx with her mother

You see this is coparenting

and in an ideal world

my mother would have had a coparent too

She would have had support

someone to show up and give her a break a time off

In an ideal world every parent is a coparent

In an ideal world both parents share the weight of the work appropriately

Lilah's mother and I have a schedule

Some days I leave work and pick Lilah up from school

some days I don't

Lilah's mother gets to go rock climbing

or study for the LSAT
LSAT
and I get to stand in a room full of bold dynamic and powerful women

and talk about dad stuff

Applause

It is work it is beautifully hard work

dismantling the systems that would have us believe

a woman's primary role is in the kitchen tending to all things domestic

while the hapless dad fumbles all over himself

whenever he has to spend a weekend alone with the kids

It is work that needs to happen right now

You see far too often

what it seems like is when both parents are working

one parent is typically tasked with organizing the household

and keeping the home running

That person is typically a woman or someone who identifies as such

Far too often those who identify as mothers and as women

have to sacrifice their dreams in order to appease the standard

They have to sacrifice their dreams

in order to ensure that motherhood takes precedence over all else

And I'm not here to say that it doesn't but what I am here to say is

as equal partners and coparents it is our duty to ensure

that our coparenting partners don't have to put their passions

their pursuits and their dreams

to the back burner

just because we're too selfabsorbed to show up as allies

Applause

Coparenting makes the space possible for everybody

As a coparent

the time I've gotten to share and spend with Lilah

is time I appreciate

the time that has allowed me to be fully present for my child

removing the notion that the emotional labor required to raise a child

is a woman's work

As a coparent Lilah and I have built snowmen

we've played with acorns

we've rapped to the soundtrack of Moana I know you have too

Laughter

She's sat with me while I've led workshops at Columbia University

when I talk about the intersections of poetry hiphop and theater

We get to talk about her emotions and her feelings

because we have exclusive time together

and that time is planned time

it's organized around not just my schedule but her mother's

Both of us as coparents have unique parenting styles

And we may argue at times

but what we can always agree on is how to raise a human 

our human

I will never fully understand or comprehend

what it means to hold a child in my body for  months

I will never be able to understand

the trials and tribulations of breastfeeding

the work that it takes

the emotional physical psychological and emotional toll

that carrying a human can have on the female body

What coparenting does is say

we can create balance

a more balanced home and work life for everyone involved

Coparenting says that while parenting may involve sacrifices yes

the weight of that sacrifice is not solely resting on one parent alone

No matter your relational dynamic

no matter how you identify as a human being 

he she they ze 

coparenting says we can create space and equity

better communication empathy I hear you I see you

how can I show up for you in ways that benefits our family

My goal

I want more fathers to embrace coparenting as a model

for a better tomorrow a better today for ourselves

for our coparenting partners for our families for our community

I want more fathers talking about fatherhood openly

candidly honestly lovingly

Right

I want more people to recognize that black fathers in particular

are more than the court system more than child support

and more than what the media might portray us to be

Applause

Our role as fathers our role as parents

our value as parents

is not dependent on the zeroes at the ends of our checks

but the capacity within our hearts to show up for our families

for the people we love for our little ones

Being a father is not only a responsibility it's an opportunity

This is for Dwain this is for Kareem Buc Drayton this is for Biggs
DwainKareemBucDraytonBiggs
this is for Boola this is for Tyron

this is for all the black fathers who are showing up on a daytoday basis

This is for Charles Lorenzo Daniels my father who didn't have the language

or the tools to show up in the ways that he wanted to

Thank you

My name is Joel

Hi Bria hi West

In Yoruba Amen

[How can we control the coronavirus pandemic]
[]
[From infectious disease expert Adam Kucharski]
[Adam Kucharski]
[Question  What does containment mean when it comes to outbreaks]
[]
Containment is this idea that you can focus your effort on control

very much on the cases and their contacts

So you're not causing disruption to the wider population

you have a case that comes in you isolate them

you work out who they've come into contact with

who's potentially these opportunities for exposure

and then you can follow up those people

maybe quarantine them to make sure that no further transmission happens

So it's a very focused targeted method

and for SARS it worked remarkably well
SARS
But I think for this infection

because some cases are going to be missed or undetected

you've really got to be capturing a large chunk of people at risk

If a few slip through the net

potentially you're going to get an outbreak

[Question  If containment isn't enough what comes next]
[]
In that respect

it would be about massive changes in our social interactions

And so that would require

of the opportunities that could spread the virus

so these kind of close contacts

everybody in the population on average

will be needing to reduce those interactions

potentially by twothirds to bring it under control

That might be through working from home

from changing lifestyle

and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners

And of course these measures things like school closures

and other things that just attempt to reduce

the social mixing of a population

[Question  What are the risks that we need people to think about]
[]
It's not just whose hand you shake

it's whose hand that person goes on to shake

And I think we need to think about these seconddegree steps

that you might think you have low risk

and you're in a younger group

but you're often going to be a very short step away

from someone who is going to get hit very hard by this

And I think we really need to be socially minded

and think this could be quite dramatic in terms of change of behavior

but it needs to be

to reduce the impact that we're potentially facing

[Question  How far apart should people stay from each other]
[]
I think it's hard to pin down exactly

but I think one thing to bear in mind is that there's not so much evidence

that this is a kind of aerosol and it goes really far 

it's reasonably short distances

I don't think it's the case

that you're sitting a few meters away from someone

and the virus is somehow going to get across

It's in closer interactions

and it's why we're seeing so many transmission events

occur in things like meals and really tightknit groups

Because if you imagine

that's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces

and onto hands and onto faces

and it's really situations like that we've got to think more about

[Question  What kind of protective measures
[
should countries put in place]
]
I think that's what people are trying to piece together

first in terms of what works

It's only really in the last sort of few weeks

we've got a sense that this thing can be controllable

with this extent of interventions

but of course not all countries can do what China have done

some of these measures

incur a huge social economic psychological burden

on populations

And of course there's the time limit

In China they've had them in for six weeks

it's tough to maintain that

so we need to think of these tradeoffs

of all the things we can ask people to do

what's going to have the most impact on actually reducing the burden

I want to lead here by talking a little bit about my credentials

to bring this up with you

because quite honestly

you really really should not listen to any old person with an opinion

about COVID
COVID
Laughter

So I've been working in global health for about  years

and my specific technical specialty is in health systems

and what happens when health systems experience severe shocks

I've also worked in global health journalism

I've written about global health and biosecurity

for newspapers and web outlets

and I published a book a few years back

about the major global health threats facing us as a planet

I have supported and led epidemiology efforts

that range from evaluating Ebola treatment centers

to looking at transmission of tuberculosis in health facilities

and doing avian influenza preparedness

I have a master's degree in International Health

I'm not a physician I'm not a nurse
 
My specialty isn't patient care or taking care of individual people

My specialty is looking at populations and health systems

what happens when diseases move on the large level

If we're ranking sources of global health expertise

on a scale of one to 

one is some random person ranting on Facebook
Facebook
and  is the World Health Organization

I'd say you can probably put me at like a seven or an eight

So keep that in mind as I talk to you

I'll start with the basics here because I think that's gotten lost

in some of the media noise around COVID
COVID
So COVID is a coronavirus
COVID
Coronaviruses are a specific subset of virus

and they have some unique characteristics as viruses

They use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material
RNADNA
and they're covered in spikes on the surface of the virus

They use those spikes to invade cells

Those spikes are the corona in coronavirus

COVID is known as a novel coronavirus
COVID
because until December we'd only heard of six coronaviruses

COVID is the seventh
COVID
It's new to us

It just had its gene sequencing

it just got its name

That's why it's novel

If you remember SARS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
SARS
or MERS
MERS
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome

those were coronaviruses

And they're both called respiratory syndromes

because that's what coronaviruses do 

they go for your lungs

They don't make you puke they don't make you bleed from the eyeballs

they don't make you hemorrhage

They head for your lungs

COVID is no different
COVID
It causes a range of respiratory symptoms

that go from stuff like a dry cough and a fever

all the way out to fatal viral pneumonia

And that range of symptoms is one of the reasons

it's actually been so hard to track this outbreak

Plenty of people get COVID but so gently
COVID
their symptoms are so mild they don't even go to a health care provider

They don't register in the system

Children in particular have it very easy with COVID
COVID
which is something we should all be grateful for

Coronaviruses are zoonotic

which means that they transmit from animals to people

Some coronaviruses like COVID also transmit person to person
COVID
The persontoperson ones travel faster and travel farther

just like COVID
COVID
Zoonotic illnesses are really hard to get rid of

because they have an animal reservoir

One example is avian influenza

where we can abolish it in farmed animals in turkeys in ducks

but it keeps coming back every year because it's brought to us by wild birds

You don't hear a lot about it

because avian influenza doesn't transmit persontoperson

but we have outbreaks in poultry farms every year all over the world

COVID most likely skipped from animals into people
COVID
at a wild animal market in Wuhan China

Now for the less basic parts

This is not the last major outbreak we're ever going to see

There's going to be more outbreaks and there's going to be more epidemics

That's not a maybe That's a given
 
And it's a result of the way that we as human beings

are interacting with our planet

Human choices are driving us into a position

where we're going to see more outbreaks

Part of that is about climate change

and the way a warming climate makes the world more hospitable

to viruses and bacteria

But it's also about the way we're pushing into the last wild spaces on our planet

When we burn and plow the Amazon rain forest

so that we can have cheap land for ranching

when the last of the African bush gets converted to farms

when wild animals in China are hunted to extinction

human beings come into contact with wildlife populations

that they've never come into contact with before

and those populations have new kinds of diseases

bacteria viruses stuff we're not ready for

Bats in particular

have a knack for hosting illnesses that can infect people

but they're not the only animals that do it

So as long as we keep making our remote places less remote

the outbreaks are going to keep coming

We can't stop the outbreaks with quarantine or travel restrictions

That's everybody's first impulse

Let's stop the people from moving Let's stop this outbreak from happening
 
But the fact is it's really hard to get a good quarantine in place

It's really hard to set up travel restrictions

Even the countries that have made serious investments in public health

like the US and South Korea

can't get that kind of restriction in place fast enough

to actually stop an outbreak instantly

There's logistical reasons for that and there's medical reasons

If you look at COVID right now
COVID
it seems like it could have a period where you're infected and show no symptoms

that's as long as  days

So people are walking around with this virus showing no signs

They're not going to get quarantined Nobody knows they need quarantining
 
There's also some real costs to quarantine and to travel restrictions

Humans are social animals

and they resist when you try to hold them into place

and when you try to separate them

We saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon as you put a quarantine in place

people start trying to evade it

Individual patients if they know there's a strict quarantine protocol

may not go for health care

because they're afraid of the medical system or they can't afford care

and they don't want to be separated from their family and friends

Politicians government officials

when they know that they're going to get quarantined

if they talk about outbreaks and cases

may conceal real information for fear of triggering a quarantine protocol

And of course these kinds of evasions and dishonesty

are exactly what makes it so difficult to track a disease outbreak

We can get better at quarantines and travel restrictions and we should

but they're not our only option and they're not our best option

for dealing with these situations

The real way for the long haul to make outbreaks less serious

is to build the global health system

to support core health care functions in every country in the world

so that all countries even poor ones

are able to rapidly identify and treat new infectious diseases as they emerge

China's taken a lot of criticism for its response to COVID
COVID
But the fact is what if COVID had emerged in Chad
COVID
which has three and a half doctors for every hundred thousand people

What if it had emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

which just released its last Ebola patient from treatment

The truth is countries like this don't have the resources

to respond to an infectious disease 

not to treat people and not to report on it fast enough

to help the rest of the world

I led an evaluation of Ebola treatment centers in Sierra Leone

and the fact is that local doctors in Sierra Leone

identified the Ebola crisis very quickly

first as a dangerous contagious hemorrhagic virus

and then as Ebola itself

But having identified it they didn't have the resources to respond

They didn't have enough doctors they didn't have enough hospital beds

and they didn't have enough information about how to treat Ebola

or how to implement infection control

Eleven doctors died in Sierra Leone of Ebola

The country only had  when the crisis started

By way of contrast

Dallas Baylor Medical Center has more than a thousand physicians on staff

These are the kinds of inequities that kill people

First they kill the poor people when the outbreaks start

and then they kill people all over the world

when the outbreaks spread

If we really want to slow down these outbreaks

and minimize their impact

we need to make sure that every country in the world

has the capacity to identify new diseases

treat them

and report about them so they can share information

COVID is going to be a huge burden on health systems
COVID
COVID has also revealed some real weaknesses
COVID
in our global health supply chains

Justintimeordering lean systems are great when things are going well

but in a time of crisis what it means is we don't have any reserves

If a hospital  or a country 

runs out of face masks or personal protective equipment

there's no big warehouse full of boxes that we can go to to get more

You have to order more from the supplier

you have to wait for them to produce it and you have to wait for them to ship it

generally from China

That's a time lag at a time when it's most important to move quickly

If we'd been perfectly prepared for COVID
COVID
China would have identified the outbreak faster

They would have been ready to provide care to infected people

without having to build new buildings

They would have shared honest information with citizens

so that we didn't see these crazy rumors spreading

on social media in China

And they would have shared information with global health authorities

so that they could start reporting to national health systems

and getting ready for when the virus spread

National health systems would then have been able to stockpile

the protective equipment they needed

and train health care providers on treatment and infection control

We'd have sciencebased protocols for what to do when things happen

like cruise ships have infected patients

And we'd have real information going out to people everywhere

so we wouldn't see embarrassing shameful incidents of xenophobia

like Asianlooking people getting attacked on the street in Philadelphia

But even with all of that in place

we would still have outbreaks

The choices we're making about how we occupy this planet

make that inevitable

As far as we have an expert consensus on COVID it's this
COVID
here in the US and globally

it's going to get worse before it gets better

We're seeing cases of human transmission that aren't from returning travel

that are just happening in the community

and we're seeing people infected with COVID
COVID
when we don't even know where the infection came from

Those are signs of an outbreak that's getting worse

not an outbreak that's under control

It's depressing but it's not surprising

Global health experts

when they talk about the scenario of new viruses

this is one of the scenarios that they look at

We all hoped we'd get off easy

but when experts talk about viral planning

this is the kind of situation and the way they expect the virus to move

I want to close here with some personal advice

Wash your hands

Wash your hands a lot

I know you already wash your hands a lot because you're not disgusting

but wash your hands even more

Set up cues and routines in your life to get you to wash your hands

Wash your hands every time you enter and leave a building

Wash your hands when you go into a meeting and when you come out of a meeting

Get rituals that are based around handwashing

Sanitize your phone

You touch that phone with your dirty unwashed hands all the time

I know you take it into the bathroom with you

Laughter

So sanitize your phone and consider not using it as often in public

Maybe TikTok and Instagram can be home things only
TikTokInstagram
Don't touch your face

Don't rub your eyes

Don't bite your fingernails

Don't wipe your nose on the back of your hand

I mean don't do that anyway because gross

Laughter

Don't wear a face mask

Face masks are for sick people and health care providers

If you're sick your face mask holds in all your coughing and sneezing

and protects the people around you

And if you're a health care provider

your face mask is one tool in a set of tools

called personal protective equipment

that you're trained to use so that you can give patient care

and not get sick yourself

If you're a regular healthy person wearing a face mask

it's just making your face sweaty

Laughter

Leave the face masks in stores

for the doctors and the nurses and the sick people

If you think you have symptoms of COVID
COVID
stay home call your doctor for advice

If you're diagnosed with COVID remember it's generally very mild
COVID
And if you're a smoker

right now is the best possible time to quit smoking

I mean if you're a smoker

right now is always the best possible time to quit smoking

but if you're a smoker and you're worried about COVID
COVID
I guarantee that quitting is absolutely the best thing you can do

to protect yourself from the worst impacts of COVID
COVID
COVID is scary stuff
COVID
at a time when pretty much all of our news feels like scary stuff

And there's a lot of bad but appealing options for dealing with it

panic xenophobia agoraphobia authoritarianism

oversimplified lies that make us think that hate and fury and loneliness

are the solution to outbreaks

But they're not

They just make us less prepared

There's also a boring but useful set of options

that we can use in response to outbreaks

things like improving health care here and everywhere

investing in health infrastructure and disease surveillance

so that we know when the new diseases come

building health systems all over the world

looking at strengthening our supply chains so they're ready for emergencies

and better education

so we're capable of talking about disease outbreaks and the mathematics of risk

without just blind panic

We need to be guided by equity here

because in this situation like so many

equity is actually in our own selfinterest

So thank you so much for listening to me today

and can I be the first one to tell you

wash your hands when you leave the theater

Applause

There is something we desperately need

that we cannot stop doing

it is breathing

Do you want to try

Why don't we stop breathing together

for let's say even  seconds

Is that OK

Let's do it

Get ready  OK now

Oof difficult isn't it

Well this is an incredible number

that will again take your breath away

seven

Seven what

Seven million premature deaths a year

caused by exposure to the bad quality of the air we breathe

Imagine  it's like more than the entire population of my dear Madrid

will be wiped out in one year

And you may ask

Has this information been disclosed

Has this information been publicized distributed

Well yes

We have at the moment more than  scientific papers

examining the relationship between air pollution and our health

and the global media has been regularly covering this issue

In fact in a relatively short period of time

we have come to know

that air pollution is having a negative impact

on almost all our major organs

Let's start by the lungs

When we think about air pollution we always think about the lungs

In fact every time we take a breath

we are inhaling toxic pollutants

and our poor pink and lovely lungs

are suffering all of that

Over the last  years

we have put together a lot of knowledge about what's happened to that

but let me tell you first what is air pollution

OK air pollution is a very complex mixture

of solid particles

liquid droplets

and gaseous chemicals

Imagine all of this mixture

that might come from sources like household fuel burning

or industry or traffic

or many other indoor and outdoor sources

And of course different sources of pollution

will make different mixtures of pollutants

The point is that all of these toxins

they can be combined in different ways

Let's take for instance the particulate matter the PM

It can be a mixture that will include 

look at the cocktail here 

soil and road dust

sea salt

toxic metals

diesel smog

nitrates and sulfates

and all of this toxic poison this delicious cocktail

is going through our lungs every day

and we are constantly exposed to this air pollution

because we cannot stop breathing

I mean we can do it for  seconds but no more than that

We cannot stop breathing

and in addition

we need every day around  liters of air

So we said that we have seven million deaths

caused by air pollution every year

Are we panicking

Are we keeping calm

Are we declaring a national disaster a global emergency

Well no and in fact I'm asking myself this question every day

What is happening

But here is something that maybe will force us to react more quickly

Air pollution is not just affecting our lungs

It's affecting our brain as well

This is our brain

Beautiful

We all have it

We all need it

Hopefully we all use it 

Laughter

some more than others

And in the last  years of history

the research about the relationship between air pollution

and our brain's health

has been increased dramatically

so maybe now our brain is going up in smoke

But let me tell you the evidence

what we know so far about air pollution in our brain

First there is an emerging body of evidence

regarding the potential harmful effects

of air pollutants

into our central nervous system

But let's go back to the toxic particles

Remember

We left them at the lungs

enjoying life

polluting everything

But now the smallest of them

they can cross into the bloodstream

and from the bloodstream pumped by the heart

they can reach the whole body

threatening every organ

including the brain

We used to say that air pollution has no borders

and it's true as well within our bodies

because air pollutants will cross the placental barrier

and reach the fetus and alter the cerebral cortex of our children

even before they take their first breath

Second several studies have suggested

that both prenatal and early childhood longterm exposure to air pollution

will have a negative influence on neural development

will have lower cognitive test outcomes

and there will be an influence as well a negative influence

on some behavioral disorders like autism

and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

In addition to that some evidence found

that exposing our children's and young adults' brains

for a long time to particulate matter

will cause some reactions like brain inflammation

altering the neural response

and [also] leading to the influence of more protein plaques
[]
that are accumulating

and those can increase the risks for diseases

like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's

Ironic isn't it

we are investing in our children's future

we are sending them to school every day to expand their minds

the society is investing in their education

and yet the air they breathe while waiting for the school bus

is influencing negatively the development of their brain

Let's go to the third What about adults

According to recent scientific evidence

longterm exposure to particulate matter will cause a cognitive decline

in study participants as they age

And not only that

if you expose them to longterm very fine particulate matter

their brain will age more rapidly

and they will have higher odds

of having small silent strokes

The last one  and I will not give you more evidence

because there is a ton of [it] 
[]
some epidemiological studies in animal models

have suggested that there might be an increased risk of dementia

with sustained exposure to air pollutants

So almost everybody is exposed to air pollution

Whether you live in a rural area or an urban area

whether you live in a highincome country or a lowincome country

everybody's brains including yours

are at risk

As a medical doctor

I have been dedicating the last more than  years now

of my professional life

to raise awareness about public health issues

public health risks

at the World Health Organization

and I know that the knowledge is there and the solutions as well

Sure some places are more polluted than others

but this a global issue

and no individual no city no group no country no region

will be able to solve it alone

We need very strong commitments and very strong action by everyone

civil society

private sector

even individuals

We all have a role to play

Yes we need to influence the way we consume

the way we commute

the way we use our energy

And the good thing is that all of those solutions are available

The question is if we postpone action by one day

there might be thousands of lives that we will lose

but if we postpone it by one year

we might be losing again seven million

So every policy maker every politician

needs to be aware of the consequences on human health

of postponing their decisions

In fact

this is not the first time in history

that we are confronted with the risks of this invisible killer

This was London in 

and as was done in London in the 's and the 's

governments and cities

they need to take urgent action to stop the terrible impact of air pollution

Every politician must know that delaying what they call the tough actions

like reducing traffic in cities or investing in public transport

and engaging in promoting cycling in cities

investing in renewable energy

promoting cleaner energy for cooking cooling

and transportation and heating

are solutions that are very smart

because in fact they reduce emissions

they improve air quality in line with WHO standards

which are the standards that will protect ourselves

So in fact all politicians that we need these very strong political commitments

and political will from

but [we need] all of them now
[]
Those who fail who postpone action

they have been requested even to defend their position in court

And from now on

no politician will be able to say I didn't know

So the question here is

How many lives

loss of quality of life

and losing our brain power

are we ready to accept

If the answer is none

I will request that you

while our brains are still functioning while we are still intelligent

please exercise your right put pressure on your politicians

and make sure that they take action to stop the sources of air pollution

This is the first thing we need to do to protect yourself

and to protect our beautiful brain

Thank you very much

I grew up in the late 's in rural China

during the final years of my country's pursuit of absolute equality

at the expense of liberty

At that time everybody had a job

but everyone was struggling

In the early 's my dad was an electrician

and my mom worked two shifts in the local hospital

But still we didn't have enough food

and our living conditions were dismal

We were undoubtedly equal 

we were equally poor

The state owned everything

We owned nothing

The story I'm going to share with you is about my struggles

of overcoming adversity

with my resilience grit and sheer determination

No I'm just kidding I'm not going to do that to you

Laughter

Instead I'm going to tell you

what I'm going to talk about today is about a new form of collective poverty

that many of us don't recognize

and that urgently needs to be understood

I'm sure you've noticed that in the past  years

that asset has emerged

It's been generating wealth at a breakneck pace

As a tool it has brought businesses deep customer insights

operational efficiency

and enormous topline growth

But for some

it has also provided a device to manipulate a democratic election

or perform surveillance for profit or political purposes

What is this miracle asset

You've guessed it it's data

Seven out of the top  most valuable companies in the world are tech companies

that either directly generate profit from data

or are empowered by data from the core

Multiple surveys show

that the vast majority of business decision makers

regard data as an essential asset for success

We have all experienced how data is shifting this major paradigm shift

for our personal economic and political lives

Whoever owns the data owns the future

But who's producing the data

I assume everyone in this room has a smartphone

several social media accounts

and has done a Google search or two in the past week

We are all producing data Yes
 
It is estimated that by   years from now

there will be about  billion connected devices in the world

That's an average of about  devices per person

We are already producing data every day

We'll be producing exponentially more

Google Facebook and Tencent's combined revenue in 
Facebook
was  billion US dollars

Now how many of you have received payment from them

for the data you generate for them

None right

Data has immense value but is centrally controlled and owned

You are all walking raw materials for those large data companies

but none of you are paid

Not only that

you're not even considered as part of this equation for income

So once again

we are undoubtedly equal

we're equally poor

Somebody else owns everything and we own nothing

Sounds familiar doesn't it

So what should we do

There might be some clues in how my life turned out

after that difficult start

Things began to look up for my family in the 's

The system evolved

and people began to be allowed to own a piece of what we created

People diving into the ocean

or xia hai the Chinese term

described those who left stateowned enterprise jobs

and started their own businesses

Private ownership of a business

became personal ownership of cars

properties food clothes and things

The economic machine started rolling

and people's lives began to improve

For the first time

to get rich was glorious

So in the 's when I went to study in Chengdu in west China

many young individuals like myself

were wellpositioned to take advantage of the new system

After I graduated from my university

I cofounded my first business and moved to Shenzhen

the brandnew special economic zone that used to be a fishing village

Twenty years later

Shenzhen has become a global innovation powerhouse

Private ownership was a form of liberty we didn't have before

It created unprecedented opportunities for our generations

motivating us to work and study incredibly hard

The result was that more than  million people rose out of poverty

According to the World Bank

China's extreme poverty rate in  when I was a little kid was  percent

By   percent

I am a product of that success

and I am very happy to share that today I have my own AI business

and I lead a very worldly and dynamic life

a path that was unimaginable when I was a kid in west China

Of course this prosperity came with a tradeoff

with equality the environment and freedom

And obviously I'm not here to argue that China has it all figured out

We haven't

Nor that data is fully comparable to physical assets

It is not

But my life experience allowed me to see what's hiding in plain sight

Currently the public discourse

is so focused on the regulatory and privacy issue

when it comes to data ownership

But I want to ask

What if we look at data ownership in completely different ways

What if data ownership is in fact

a personal individual and economic issue

What if in the new digital economy

we are allowed to own a piece of what we create

and give people the liberty of private data ownership

The legal concept of ownership is when you can possess

use gift pass on destroy

or trade it or sell your asset

at a price accepted by you

What if we give that same definition to individuals' data

so individuals can use or destroy our data

or we trade it at our chosen price

Now I know some of you might say

I would never ever trade my data for any amount of money

But that let me remind you is exactly what you're doing now

except you're giving your data away for free

Plus privacy is a very personal and nuanced issue

You might have the privilege to prioritize your privacy over money

but for millions of small business owners in China

who can't get bank loans easily

using their data to gain rapid loan approval from AIpowered lenders

can answer their more pressing needs

What's private to you

is different from what's private to others

What's private to you now

is different from what was private when you were in college

Or at least I hope so

Laughter

We are always although often subconsciously

making such tradeoffs

based on our diverse personal beliefs and life priorities

That is why data ownership would be incomplete

without a pricing power

By assigning pricing power to individuals

we gain a tool to reflect our personal and nuanced preferences

So for example you could choose to donate your data for free

if a contribution to a particular medical research

is very meaningful for you

Or if we had the tools to set our behavior data

at a price of say  US dollars

I doubt any political group would be able to target

or manipulate your vote

You control You decide
 
Now I know this sounds probably implausible

but trends are already pointing to

a growing and very powerful individual data ownership movement

First startups are already creating tools

to allow us to take back some control

A new browser called Brave
Brave
empowers users with Brave Shields  they literally call it that 

by aggressively blocking datagrabbing ads and trackers

and avoid leaking data like other browsers

In return users can take back some bargaining and pricing power

When users opt in to accept ads

Brave rewards users with basic attention tokens

that can redeem content behind paywalls from publishers

And I've been using Brave for a few months
Brave
It has already blocked more than  ads and trackers

and saved hours of my time

Now I know some of you interact with your browser

more than with your partners so 

Laughter

you should at least find one that doesn't waste your time and is not creepy

Laughter

Do you think Google is indispensable

Think again

A search engine is indispensable

Google just has the monopoly 

for now

A search engine called DuckDuckGo doesn't store your personal information
DuckDuckGo
or follow you around with ads

or track your personal browsing history

Instead it gives all users the same search results

instead of based on your personal browsing records

In London a company called digime
digime
offers an app you can download on your smartphone

that helps to import and consolidate your data generated by you

from your Fitbit Spotify
FitbitSpotify
social media accounts 

And you can choose where to store your data

and digime will help you to make your data work for you
digitalme
by providing insights that used to be exclusively accessible

by large data companies

In DC a new initiative called UBDI UBDI
DCUBDIUBDI
Universal Basic Data Income

helps people to make money

by sharing anonymous insights through their data

for companies that can use them for market research

And whenever a company purchases a study

users get paid in cash and UBDI points to track their contribution
UBDI
potentially as much as  US dollars per year

per their estimation

UBDI could be a very feasible path for universal basic income
UBDI
in the AI economy

Further individual awareness of privacy and data ownership

is growing fast

as we all become aware of this monster we have unleashed in our pocket

I'm a mother of two preteen girls

and trust me

the single biggest source of stress and anxiety as a parent

for me is my children's relationship with technology

This is a threepage agreement my husband and I make them sign

before they receive their first [mobile phone]

Laughter

We want to help them to become

digital citizens

but only if we can make them become smart and responsible ones

I help them to understand what kind of data should never be shared

So if you Google me

in fact  actually sorry  if you DuckDuckGo me

you will find maybe a lot about me and my work

but you may find no information about my daughters

When they grow up

if they want to put themselves out there it's their choice not mine

despite that I insist they're the most beautiful

smartest and most extraordinary kids in the world of course

And I know many people are having similar conversations

and making similar decisions

which gives me hope

that a truly smart datarich future will be here soon

But I want to highlight the Clause  of this agreement

It says I will never ever search for any information online

if I would be embarrassed if seen by Grandma Dawnie
Dawnie
Laughter

Try it It's really effective
 
Laughter

Throughout history

there has always been a tradeoff between liberty and equality

in the pursuit of prosperity

The world has constantly been going through the circle of wealth accumulation

to wealth redistribution

As the tension between the haves and havenots

is breaking so many countries

it is in everyone's interest

including the large data companies

to prevent this new form of inequality

Of course individual data ownership is not the perfect nor the complete answer

to this profoundly complex question

of what makes a good digital society

But according to McKinsey

AI will add  trillion US dollars of economic output in the next  years

Data generated by individuals will no doubt contribute

to this enormous growth

Shouldn't we at least consider an economic model

that empowers the people

And if private ownership helped to lift more than  million people

out of poverty

it is our duty

and we owe it to future generations

to create a more inclusive AI economy

that will empower the people in addition to businesses

Thank you

I love making movies

Motion pictures have been in existence for more than a hundred years

Filmmaking hasn't changed for the dimensional mindset

Placing the camera in a scene and pressing record hasn't changed

Filmmaking is still a frontal experience

and creating the film has the possibility

to follow the same direction of the content creation

We still stand in front of a flat image

watching the fiction

There's nothing wrong with it

I love watching movies and going to the theaters

The experiences can be such emotional experiences

The art and craft of emotional experiences within a frame

can be so strong to drive a stronger emotion

The question we're asking is

How the experience of motion pictures can exist beyond the flat screen

How can we start creating content

for the next generation of content experiences

Traditionally when we imagine a scene

we look at the frame and the composition

We have to think about how we create depth and parallax

using foreground background elements as the camera moves

With the technology today and devices of VR glasses
VR
AR glasses smart devices

allowing threedimensional and full navigation in space

we have the possibility to enable audiences

to experience content from multiple perspectives

What we have to think about is how we take this technology

all the capabilities

and enable the experience to move farther away inside the scene

Now we're not talking about video games or computergenerated actors

which look tremendously realistic

We're talking about real actors and real performance

performing onstage

We have to start thinking how we capture the actors

and how we capture the real scene

in order to immerse inside

Now we're familiar with the degree video

where you place a camera inside the scene

and you can create this beautiful panoramic image all around you

but from the same aspect

filmmaking is still frontal

In order to emerge fully inside the scene

we will need to capture the light from all the possible directions

We will have to surround the scene with an enormous amount of sensors

with all possible capabilities to capture the light

and enable us to emerge inside afterwards again

Now in this setup

there's no more foreground or background

or a camera placed in space

but hundreds of sensors capturing the light

and capturing the motion from all the possible directions

With the new technological advancements

we can start looking at D photography

capturing the light from multiple perspectives

enabling us to reconstruct the object

This is like photography in D space
D
Now with these technological advancements

we can record video not just as a flat image

but as a volume

This is what we call volumetric video

and it has the capability to record every action of the scene

as a full threedimensional volume

Now what is a voxel

A voxel is like a threedimensional pixel

but instead of being a flat image square staying light and colored

it's like a threedimensional cube in space

with x y and z positions
xyz
This enables us to create a full capture of the scene

from any perspective

Now this renders a fully lightimmersive scene

from multiple perspectives

This capability requires an insane amount of information to be processed

We will have to capture the light from an enormous amount of cameras

to create this information

Now in order to do such a thing

we would need a setup that would host a numerous amount of cameras

installed in a stage

and a stage big enough in order to fit a full cinematic experience

Now that sounds like a crazy idea but that's exactly what we did

For the last three years

we have been building a huge volumetric camera chamber

It's  square feet of a stage

enabling to capture the action from any location

We have deployed hundreds of cameras

sending a tremendous amount of information

to a huge data center powered by Intel supercomputers

The ability to have this  feet

enables us to fit any kind of action

any kind of performance

It is the size of an average Broadway stage

We call it Intel Studios

and it's the largest volumetric stage in the world

with the objective of enabling and exploring

the next generation of this immersive media filmmaking

Now to test these ideas

we were thinking about what we can do as the first scene to try it out

So we chose the Western scene

We brought horses set designers dirt

everything needed to create the full scene of a Western

But this time there was no camera inside

There was nothing really moving besides all the cameras

installed outside

The challenge of the actors was tremendous

They have to perform a flawless action visible from all the directions

There's no possibility to hide a punch or not show the action

Everything is captured and everything is seen

The output of the capture 

this is our future capture 

opened our eyes for the immense capabilities

It was like a full D scan of the entire scene

We were able to move around and travel in the space

The thing about this

it's not anymore about perceiving the light emitted from a screen

but now traveling inside the light

traveling inside the scene

This obviously opens possibilities for an enormous amount

of storytelling and methodologies of creation

This is the possibilities of your personal narrative

the possibility of creating your own story inside

or maybe following other stories

Let's take a look at one of the last renders and see

Music

What you're seeing here is full volumetric video

and there's no physical camera in the scene

Music

We have the full control

Music sounds of combat

of space and time

Music sounds of combat

Now again no physical camera was here

Everything was captured surrounding

Now this is very nice

but what if we wanted to see the scene maybe from the eyes of the horse

Well we can do that as well

Horse galloping

So what you're seeing right now is the same action

but this time we're watching exactly from the eyes of the horse

The possibilities are well unlimited

Applause

Thank you

Applause

So this is all great for creators and storytellers

It really opens a huge canvas

for a different type of storytelling and moviemaking

But what about the audience

How can the audience experience this differently

In order to [create] our explorations
[]
we partnered with Paramount Pictures

in order to explore immersive media in a Hollywood movie production

Together with the director Randal Kleiser

we reimagined the iconic movie of 

Grease

Some of you know it some of you don't

A yearold movie amazing experience

And our goal was really to look at how we can take this iconic action and dance

and bring it deeper into the experience

bring it deeper into the audience

Imagine that you can not just watch the movie

but get inside it and dance with the actors

and dance with the performance

Now we're breaking really the traditional D mindset of thinking
D
and bringing a much richer possibility of moviemaking

and content creation

But why watch it on the screen

Let's try to bring these actors here on the stage

So they're not going to really come 

I'm going to use an iPad
iPad
Laughter

Sorry

I'm going to use an iPad in order to bring in augmented reality
iPad
Now obviously these devices have their own limitations

in terms of the datacomputing process

so we have to reduce the amount of resolution

So what I'm doing now I'm placing here a marker

so I'll be able to position exactly where I want everyone to appear

OK

I think we have them here

Applause and cheers

Diego Prilusky Thank you

Applause and cheers

So as you can see

we can watch and experience content in the traditional way

or in an immersive way

Really the possibilities are open

We're not trying to change or replace movies

We're enhancing them

The technologies enable new possibilities to start thinking beyond the flat screen

We're in immersive and really exciting times in filmmaking

We're at the threshold of a new era

We're opening the gates for new possibilities

of immersive storytelling

and exploration and defining what immersive media filmmaking means

We're really just at the beginning

and we invite you all to join us

Thank you

I love dumplings

But I seldom have dumplings in a restaurant

because my mom's cooking is the best

One day I happened to take a bite of Dumpling Xi's dish

To my surprise

they had a flavor of going home

Fresh chewy and unexpected

In addition to being a dumpling lover

I actually have a fulltime job

I am a management consultant

so naturally I was keen to understand

the reasons behind those delicious dumplings

What I didn't expect

is that this dumpling triggered my exploration

of new ways of management in China

A change that is deeply rooted in ancient Chinese philosophies

But first let's go back to the dumplings

Go Df founded Dumpling Xi  years ago
G  o D  f  Xi
Today the company enjoys  stores with  employees

But it wasn't always the case

Three years ago

the demand for his dumplings was soaring

due to consumers' craving for healthy food

But the strong growth of online food delivery services

had pulled the consumers away from store visits

causing a huge concern for Go

If I were to advise Go back then

I would go directly with the classical approach

hiring venture managers

providing training on how to integrate onlineoffline sales

or having some high potentials fully dedicated to the new job

such as a Chief Digital Officer

But Go did something totally different

He invented a twohat model

Instead of recruiting new executives

he invited five successful original heads

to take on a second role at headquarters

The catch was they had to do it while still being the frontline managers

Keep in mind that these people had no formal training

or related experience in this field

What they did have though was natural strengths

and a growth mindset

When Go first told me the idea I said

Are you sure

I have seldom seen companies as large as yours

having parttime senior executives

But Go smiled

This is my dumpling way

Go's team was also puzzled

In the first three months the sales fluctuated

some even dropped by  percent

But Go didn't blink

The regional heads had to learn new skills while still doing their job

Things like what kinds of dumplings can be sold online

how to digitalize their supply chain

After the transition period

something magical happened

The sales came back

One year later

the company began to launch its fresh and spicy dumplings online

Two years later

more talents with startup dreams were attracted

More importantly

the company began to translate these individual new capabilities

into company policies

and roll them out

A true differentiator compared with his peers

Because most Chinese entrepreneurs

are very good at growth strategies

In Chinese we call it ki jing ku t
kai jing ku  t 
expanding territories

but not so good at what we call zh gu n bng
zhigu  n bng
converting individual best practices

into company policies for the long run

The nature of Go's approach

such as having tolerance for frontline managers

to make mistakes

or having some new ideas not coming from the top

is not common in China

Because they go against our traditions

In the past  years

Confucianism has been dominant in China

which values seniority and authority

For a nation this is a timetested formula

to ensure order and harmony

For a company

this ensures precise execution at a large scale

But with business environments constantly changing

internet disrupting traditional industries

new millennials becoming a major workforce

new ways of management emerge

I feel so lucky to study this in such a dynamic age

while at the same time

to satisfy my stomach with delicious dumplings

Go's twohat approach is just one example

Another example comes from Miranda Qu
Miranda Qu
the founder of Xiaohongshu

Xiaohongshu is a thriving internet company with  million users

It is an online community where young fans can get together

to talk about their favorite soap opera Go Go Squid

Or buy the cool shoes that the lead actress wears

in a running scene

From the early days

Qu wanted the whole organization to be ready to spot things

that need to change

and challenge the authority

But one day

she noticed her interns were calling senior staff teachers

This may sound innocent

but it signaled a problem to Qu

Because if the teacher phenomenon becomes a norm

it will encourage hierarchy and discourage ownership

This is also something related to Confucian thinking

In Chinese we call it benfen

Ben means me myself

Fen means the share of the job
Fen
I will just focus on my job and not cross any lines

which is totally the opposite to Qu's thinking

So Qu created a unique initiative called Signature Program

In the program

each employee chooses an avatar character

that pops up alongside digital communication channels

Some common ideas include Captain Hook Harry Potter

and many wellknown characters in Chinese literature

The way these characters interact proved to be the answer to Qu's problem

Avatars from the same story would get together

to talk about their favorite characters

In the community called Slam Dunk

people from different cities different departments

different levels of the organization

they would talk about how these characters inspired them at work

An employee with a signature called Coach Anzai

was facing some difficulty in leading a very young team

Other Dunk fans will share the best practices

on how to motivate a diversified team

and inspire them to work to their full potential

The signature program plays a pivotal role

in fostering a collaborative environment at Xiaohongshu

Not only the teacher issue has disappeared

the company has been ranked

as one of the most innovative Chinese companies by Forbes

in the past two years

Go's twohat approach and Qu's signature program

are just two examples of empowering the frontline staff

But these methods may not always be right

Let's take Ping An for example

Very successful insurance company

The company couldn't adopt

such an approach for the whole organization

because one the company has  employees

and the line between innovative chaos and chaotic chaos is very thin

Two the company has five ecosystems and plus sectors 

health care insurance

real estate smart city

Very difficult to apply a bottomup innovation to all

But the company still needs to be innovating

Ma Mingzhe the founder

positions the headquarters as the steering wheel

Steering innovations and new ideas

cascading them down to its subsidiaries

One of the ideas that headquarters came up with

is AIenabled loss assessment
AI
For a notsocomplicated case

the car owner can take a picture of the damaged car

upload it online

The insurance center can decide a claim amount right away

by AIenabled loss assessment
AI
Facial recognition ID verification

The car owner can get a payment in a few minutes

which could have taken a few days

So for companies that [find it] difficult to conduct grassroots innovation

a centralized approach is also an option

The more I see these unconventional management mechanisms 

Go with two hats

Qu with the signature program

and Ma with the steering wheel 

the more I ponder where do these mechanisms come from

They're definitely not Confucian

They are very similar to another Asian school of thought

Taoism

Confucianism believes the way to achieve perfection

is to organize and regulate things

But Taoism believes in letting things work to their perfection naturally

to support their natural state

and to let them transform spontaneously

In other words leaders should not impose their will

Leaders should act by shaping the context

rather than control

Confucianism works best in winning a stable context

whereas Taoism with its power to shape the context

is more effective in dealing with uncertainty

A leader is best when people barely know he exists

When work is done people say

We did it ourselves

Thank you

My name is Rebecca and I'm a cyborg

Laughter

Specifically I have  computer chips inside my head

which rebuild my sense of hearing

This is called a cochlear implant

You remember the Borg from Star Trek

those aliens who conquered and absorbed everything in sight

Well that's me

Laughter

The good news is I come for your technology

and not for your human lifeforms

Laughter

Actually I've never seen an episode of Star Trek

Laughter

But there's a reason for that

television wasn't closedcaptioned when I was a kid

I grew up profoundly deaf

I went to regular schools and I had to lipread

I didn't meet another deaf person until I was 

Electronics were mostly audio back then

My alarm clock was my sister Barbara

who would set her alarm and then throw something at me to wake up

Laughter

My hearing aids were industrialstrength sledgehammer volume

but they helped me more than they helped most people

With them I could hear music and the sound of my own voice

I've always liked the idea that technology can help make the world more human

I used to watch the stereo flash color when the music shifted

and I knew it was just a matter of time before my watch could show me sound too

Did you know that hearing occurs in the brain

In your ear is a small organ called the cochlea

and the cochlea is lined with thousands of receptors called hair cells

When sound enters your ear

those hair cells they send electric signals to your brain

and your brain then interprets that as sound

Haircell damage is really common

noise exposure ordinary aging illness

My hair cells were damaged before I was even born

My mother was exposed to German measles when she was pregnant with me

About five percent of the world has significant hearing loss

By  that's expected to double to over  million people

or one in 

For seniors it's already one out of three

With a cochlear implant

computer chips do the job for the damaged hair cells

Imagine a box of  crayons

and those  crayons in combination

have to make all of the colors in the universe

Same with the cochlear implant

I have  electrodes in each of my cochleas

Those  electrodes in combination send signals to my brain

representing all of the sounds in the universe

I have electronics inside and outside of my head

to make that happen

including a small processor magnets inside my skull

and a rechargeable power source

Radio waves transmit sound through the magnets

The number one question that I get about the cochlear implant

when people hear about the magnets

is whether my head sticks to the refrigerator

Laughter

No it does not

Laughter

Applause

Thank you thank you

Applause

I know this because I tried

Laughter

Hearing people assume that the Deaf

live in a perpetual state of wanting to hear

because they can't imagine any other way

But I've never once wished to be hearing

I just wanted to be part of a community like me

I wanted everyone else to be deaf

I think that sense of belonging is what ultimately connects our stories

and mine felt incomplete

When cochlear implants first got going

back in the 's

the operation was Frankensteinmonster scary

By  the procedure had evolved considerably

but it still wiped out any natural hearing that you had

The success rate then for speech comprehension was low

maybe  percent

So if it didn't work you couldn't go back

At that time implants were also controversial in the Deaf culture

Basically it was considered the equivalent

of changing the color of your skin

I held off for a while

but my hearing was going downhill fast

and hearing aids were no longer helping

So in  I made the tough decision to have the cochlear implant

I just needed to stop that soulsucking cycle of loss

regardless of whether the operation worked

and I really didn't think that it would

I saw it as one last box to check off

before I made the transition to being completely deaf

which a part of me wanted

Complete silence is very addictive

Maybe you've spent time in a sensory deprivation tank

and you know what I mean

Silence has mindexpanding capabilities

In silence I see sound

When I watch a music video without sound

I can hear music

In the absence of sound

my brain fills in the gaps based on the movement I see

My mind is no longer competing with the distraction of sound

It's freed up to think more creatively

There are advantages to having bionic body parts as well

It's undeniably convenient to be able to hear

and I can turn it off any time I want

Laughter

I'm hearing when I need to be and the rest of the time I'm not

Bionic hearing doesn't age

although external parts sometimes need replacement

It would be so cool

to just automatically regenerate a damaged part like a real cyborg

but I get mine FedExed from Advanced Bionics

Laughter

Oh I get updates

downloaded into my head

Laughter

It's not quite AirDrop  but close

Laughter

With the cochlear implant

I can stream music from my iPod into my head without earbuds
iPod
Recently I went to a friend's long tedious concert 

Laughter

and unknown to anyone else

I listened to the Beatles for three hours instead

Laughter

Applause

Technology has come so far so fast

The biggest obstacle I face as a deaf person

is no longer a physical barrier

It's the way that people respond to my deafness

the outdated way people respond to my deafness 

pity patronization even anger 

because that just cancels out the human connection

that technology achieves

I once had a travel roommate who had a complete temper tantrum

because I didn't hear her knocking on the door

when her key didn't work

If I hadn't been there no problem she could get another key

but when she saw that I was there her anger boiled over

It was no longer about a key

It was about deafness not being a good enough reason

for her inconvenience

Or the commercial about the deaf man

whose neighborhood surprised him with sign language messages

from people on the street

Everyone who sent me the video told me they cried

so I asked them

Well what if he wasn't deaf

What if his first language was Spanish

and everyone learned Spanish instead

Would you have cried

And they all said no

They weren't crying because of the communication barrier

they were crying because the man was deaf

But I see it differently

What if the Borg showed up in that video

and the Borg said Deafness is irrelevant

Because that's what they say right

Everything's irrelevant

And then the Borg assimilated the deaf guy 

not out of pity not out of anger

but because he had a biological distinctiveness

that the Borg wanted

including unique language capabilities

I would much rather see that commercial

Laughter

Why does thinking about ability make people so uncomfortable

You might know a play later a movie

called Children of a Lesser God

by Mark Medoff
Mark Medoff
That play that title

actually comes from a poem by Alfred Tennyson

and I interpret both the play and title

to say that humans who are perceived as defective

were made by a lesser God

and live an inferior existence

while those made by the real God are a superior class

because God doesn't make mistakes

In World War II

an estimated  people with disabilities
 
were murdered in special death camps

because they didn't fit Hitler's vision of a superior race

Hitler said that he was inspired by the United States

which had enacted involuntary sterilization laws for the unfit

in the early s

That practice continued in more than  states until the 's

with the last law finally repealed in 

So the world is not that far removed from Tennyson's poem

That tendency to make assumptions about people based on ability

comes out in sentences like

You're so special I couldn't live like that

or Thank God that's not me

Changing how people think is like getting them to break a habit

Before the implant I had stopped using the voice telephone

and switched to email

but people kept leaving me voice mail

They were upset that I was unreachable by phone

and not returning messages

I continued to tell them my situation

It took them months to adapt

Fastforward  years

and you know who else hated voice mail

Millennials

Laughter

And you know what they did

They normalized texting for communication instead

Now when it comes to ignoring voice mail

it no longer matters whether you're deaf or just selfabsorbed

Laughter

Applause

Millennials changed how people think about messaging

They reset the default

Can I just tell you how much I love texting

Oh and group texts

I have six siblings 

they're all hearing

but I don't think any less of them

Laughter

And we all text

Do you know how thrilling it is

to have a visual means of communication that everyone else actually uses

So I am on a mission now

As a consumer of technology

I want visual options whenever there's audio

It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf

or don't want to wake the baby

Both are equally valid

Smart designers

include multiple ways to access technology

but segregating that access under accessibility 

that's just hiding it from mainstream users

In order to change how people think

we need to be more than accessible

we need to be connected

Apple did this recently

On my iPhone it automatically displays a visual transcript
iPhone
of my voice mail

right next to the audio button

I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to

You know what else

Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime no longer say
NetflixHuluAmazon Prime
Closedcaptioned for the hearing impaired

They say subtitles on or off

with a list of languages underneath including English

Technology has come so far

Our mindset just needs to catch up

Resistance is futile

Laughter

You have been assimilated

Thank you

Ivana KoromJoanna Pietrulewicz
A few years ago

I had a corporate feminist dream job

Launching a company's national initiative

to recruit more female employees

In the finance sector

But first I had to get the signedoff support

of all department heads

So I spent months perfecting the proposal

presented it

and won the support of almost everyone

But in this team there were two men we'll call Howard and Tom

Howard just would not get back to me

I emailed him about the proposal

I left him voice mails

I'd roll my chair back and forth during meetings

trying to make eye contact with Howard

Laughter

He'd just take out his phone and start scrolling

And then I started to question myself

Had I been diplomatic enough in that email

Too demanding in that voice mail

Does Howard hate this proposal

or am I just overreacting

It's probably just me I thought

And then one day

I'm walking down the hall and here comes Howard

He's holding a packet of papers

sees me and lights up

He says

Sara Tom just emailed this to me you should take a look
Tom
It's a proposal for us to recruit more women

Laughter

I think Tom has a really great idea here

and we should all get behind it

Howard proceeds to hand my own proposal back to me

And explains to me the many merits of what I wrote

Laughter

Howard was never against recruiting more women

But he needed to hear from a man

why it was important to hire more women

And as this scene played out

I said nothing

Because I knew somehow that I was a guest

in a place that wasn't meant for me

And so instead of questioning my environment

I questioned myself

I wanted to know

how so many talented women who worked long hours

and started their careers with confidence

all became trained in this kind of selfdoubt that makes them say

It's probably just me

How was that still possible

Aren't things getting better

Opportunities for women have increased over the last  years

But over the last decade progress has stalled

Experts have previously identified 

as the year the wage gap would close

But in September of this year

these same experts announced that according to the most current data

we'll have to adjust our expectations

to the year 

Audience murmurs

One hundred one years from now

Looking beyond the wage gap

women are still underrepresented in leadership

receive less access to senior leaders

and are leaving the fastestgrowing sectors

such as tech

at  percent higher rates than men

citing culture as the primary reason

So what have we been doing to address gender inequality

Why isn't it working

Many businesses think they're addressing the problem

because they provide training

Eight billion dollars worth of training a year

according to studies from the Harvard Business Review

These same studies also conclude that these trainings don't work

and often backfire

Research tracking the hiring and promotion practices of  companies

over the course of  years

found that white men who are asked to go to diversity trainings

tend to rebel

by hiring and promoting fewer women

and fewer minorities

The other solution has been to ask women to change their own behavior

To lean in

To sit at the table

Negotiate as often as men

Oh and get more training

Women currently earn the majority of college degrees

outperform their peers in key leadership skills

and are running businesses that outperform the competition

It doesn't look like education

or skills or business acumen are the problem

We're already empowered

Enough to make an impact on the businesses that are ready

These approaches fail to address the key systemic problem

Unconscious bias

Applause

We all have bias it's OK

It's lodged in our amygdala

it keeps ticking away when we go to work

Bias affects how much I like you

what I believe you're capable of

and even how much space I think you take up

Thanks in part to the Me Too movement
Me Too
awareness of gender bias has spread

But the harassment stories that made headlines

are just one piece

You don't have to harass a woman to limit her career

The messages women send me aren't about being harassed

They're being tolerated in the workplace

But they're not being valued

I don't know anyone who has ever said

You know what I love about my employer

They just tolerate me so well

I feel so tolerated

Laughter

To break the inertia

we need to take a step beyond Me Too

Beyond just being tolerated as women

Our organization decided to tackle the problem in two ways

First if we're all biased

our workplaces need to be actively antibiased by design

not by trying to change mindsets one training at a time

So our team began by identifying over  cultural levers

that can be adjusted to counter the impact of bias

We found that small tweaks can lead to big changes

And they cost a lot less than eight billion dollars

So what do these small tweaks look like

If a woman is asked to state her gender

before filling out a job application

or performing a skillsrelated test

she performs worse than if she were not asked first

So how can businesses avoid activating this selfstereotyping bias

Move the gender check box to the end of the application

Example two

In a national survey that we conducted

men were  percent more likely to state

they had received multiple frequent evaluations

over the course of the last year

As opposed to one single yearly review

Here's why this matters

Fortune magazine reviewed performance evals across industries

And found that criticism like this related to personality

[Watch your tone]
[]
but not jobrelated skills

appeared in  of the  yearly reviews received by women

Of the  reviews received by men

personality criticism showed up twice

But in businesses that conduct much shorter highly frequent reviews

say fiveminute weekly evaluations

focused on specific projects

the personality criticism vanishes

And the perceived performance gap between men and women

is nearly nonexistent

While yearly reviews rely on overall impressions

which are like petri dishes for bias

short objectively focused evaluations

eliminate this feelingsbased gray area

Now some businesses are consciously taking these steps

to counter the impact of bias

while others just do a good job of advertising

We wanted to find out who is actually getting it right

So we put a poll on Facebook
Facebook
we asked women in workshops

how they were choosing employers where they would be valued

The most common response that we heard

I Google it

So we googled it

Laughter

Specifically we googled best employers for women in tech

Our results showed three completely different lists

One business shows up as the top employer on one list

doesn't show up at all on another

some lists offer no criteria

and some are purchased ads

They're paid for

Employees and employers both want clear benchmarks

that go beyond good intentions

The LEED certification gave businesses this clarity
LEED
around environmental stewardship

by outlining the exact steps they need to take for certification

We wanted businesses to have this kind of playbook for gender equity

So for our second act

we took what we had learned from testing these cultural levers

we partnered with the University of Washington

and created the first standardized certification

for gender equity in US businesses

Applause

Thank you

Applause

To create this standard

we had to learn what matters and what doesn't

We found out that what matters

is not the total percentage of female employees

Or the number of board members that are female

Those are what we call vanity metrics

They can be bought

while the culture inside can still be out of balance

The factors that matter and that should be measured

are under the surface

For example

even in organizations where equal percentages of women and men

state that they have had access to a mentor

men's mentors are more likely to be in senior positions

Reviewing our survey results

men were twice as likely to state

they had been offered an opportunity to shadow someone in a senior role

We're all used to hearing about the wage gap

Hidden opportunity gaps like these are just as influential

So when assessing a company's culture

we measure these gaps between men's and women's experiences

And the smaller the gap

the more equity is center of the culture

We also searched our findings

for the tenets of workplace culture

that are most important to men and most important to women

We learned that only three factors consistently matter to men

while a dozen matter to women

And they only share one in common

Topping the list for women

Paid family leave

health care for dependents

and feeling that their ideas are heard

and they're properly credited for them

These are a few of the  indicators

that determine whether or not an organization

meets our quantitative standard for workplace equality

Based on the data that matter

These are the factors

to create a culture of equity that lasts

Not just for a month or for a quarter

but for years

So where does this leave us

Women in the workforce today are constantly told

You can be anything you want now

It's up to you

Women of color

for whom the wage gap is even larger

have heard it

The twothirds of minimumwage workers who are women have heard it

Workers who don't identify as male or female

and hide their identity at work

have heard it

If they can hear You can be anything you want now

it's up to you

I believe it's time for our businesses to hear it too

Eliminating workplace bias is a tall order

But we can't afford to let half our people go on

being ignored

We've given businesses a framework for real change

Businesses can be anything they want now

It is up to them

Thank you

Applause

Have you ever been robbed

Or had something you value forcibly taken from you

against your will

It's violating

Feelings of fury of assault

and of helplessness

That's what corruption feels like

Corruption is theft

It is corrosive

it is criminal

it is toxic

and it is predatory

Now I'm from Kenya

and in Kenya corruption takes different forms

I want to share the story of Karura Forest with you

This is my hometown of Nairobi

I love Nairobi It's beautiful
 
But it is a city of paradoxes

It is at once beautiful

and challenging

But at the heart of this beautiful city

that I call home

is Karura Forest

an oasis of green expansive beauty that would be the envy of any city anywhere

We almost lost Karura Forest to corruption

Word has reached my mother Wangari Maathai
Wangari Maathai
that Karura Forest is under attack

There was a construction site coming up right in the middle of the forest

Government officials had stolen the forest

They had divided sold and gifted hundreds of parcels of Karura
Karura
to their friends and cronies

Now in 

my mother founded the Green Belt Movement

to plant trees across Kenya

restore green spaces

and protect green spaces much like Karura Forest
Karura
She got together her friends and allies

and together they created what became

one of the most successful treeplanting campaigns in the world

It was therefore no surprise

that when word got to her that Karura was under attack
Karura
they immediately sprang into action

They battled police and hired goons

to stop the theft of this forest

But fortunately there was an uprising of support

from the clergy politicians students and the general public

all of whom came out to say no to corruption and greed

And pretty soon that support was too strong and intense

for the authorities to subdue

And Karura Forest was saved

In the s I joined my mother in the Green Belt Movement

and witnessed the growth of the movement's advocacy activities

its expansion beyond Kenya

and an extremely important growing consensus

around the  Nobel Peace Prize that she received 

that the environment democracy and peace were inextricably linked

I also learned that what my mother had faced that many years ago

trying to protect Karura Forest
Karura
was not an isolated incident

The corruption and greed that manifested itself then

is alive and well today

from greedy politicians and public servants

willing to loot public coffers

at their expense

Corruption is everywhere

Now corruption is devastating to any economy democracy

and the environment

It robs citizens of vital social services

and renders human life worthless

When young men are willing

to join gangs

and brutalize their communities

for a small fee

and women are raped on the way to work

and when they report this

the perpetrators bribe their way out of jail

and when young girls have to sell their bodies

to buy sanitary towels

you know the society is broken

In recent years Kenya has been ranked

amongst the top  most corrupt countries in the world

Even more frustrating for me is that Kenya loses

a third of her national budget to corruption each year

That is six billion dollars

It is totally unacceptable

In a country where anticorruption efforts have been frustrated and ignored

and interfered with

we absolutely need new strategies for dealing with this vice

We cannot complain forever

We either decide that we're going to live with it

or we are going to change it

There's some good news

Human beings are not born corrupt

At some point these behaviors are fostered by a culture

that promotes individual gain over collective progress

So if we're going to uproot corruption

we have got to start before it ever takes root

We have got to intervene early

I don't know about your country

but where I come from

youth will lead us into the future

In Kenya today  percent of the population is under the age of 

But by their own admission they have conflicting values

Fiftyeight percent of young people in Kenya recently told us

they will do anything to make money

An additional  percent said

corruption is a legitimate tool for doing business

Seventythree percent

said they would not be willing to stand up for what they believe in

for fear of retribution

What I learned from my mother

a few years ago

was this concept of the power of one 

that each of us can be potent agents of change

and that together we are a force

that if we put our hands together we can change the situation

and no problem is too big

My mother understood this so profoundly

that it was at the center of her work

Shifting cultures takes patience persistence and commitment

and it is extremely slow and deep work

But if we are going to shift a culture we have got to get that work started

And in the time since her passing we have established a foundation in her name

to do exactly that

but to work with young people and children

to begin to build character and personal leadership

to inspire purpose and integrity

But fighting corruption is not as easy as saying corruption is bad

Now here are three strategies that we are employing

that we believe can be replicated in any school community

First we must understand the why

Why does corruption happen in the first place

Do we call it for what it is  theft 

or do we gloss over it with other words

When young children are able to model what it looks and feels like

to deal with corruption

they are likely when faced with a dilemma in their future

to model what they've been taught

Second we need to teach character explicitly

Now this may seem obvious

but a child who exhibits a growth mindset

and a sense of selfcontrol

is selfconfident

And a selfconfident child is likely to stand up for what they believe

Third we need to build personal leadership in our children early

to give them an opportunity to know what it looks like

to call corruption out when they see it

what it feels like to stand up and be counted when they're needed

and for me to make the more and most important connection

between human suffering on one hand

and corruption greed and selfishness on the other

We have got to believe in our capacity

to bring about the future we want to see

each of us in our small way

Young people must believe

that a new reality is possible

Corruption climate change

ecosystem collapse biodiversity loss 

all these issues need leadership

And in the words of Baba Dioum of Senegal
Baba Dioum
In the final analysis

we will conserve

only what we love

we will love

only what we understand

and we will understand

only what we are taught

Thank you

If you told me five years ago

that today I'd be delivering a talk

about our individual power to make a difference

I would have cringed

It was my job to study huge global systems

I was a researcher at NASA using satellite data to study the big picture
NASA
You can see a lot of things from space

like every ecosystem on Earth

being threatened from pretty much every angle

and global inequality in air and water safety

These kinds of things would keep me up at night

And then outside of work I'd use this bird'seye view

while thinking about our huge social structures

like education and media and health care

and it looked to me like they were all really struggling too

So I felt like the world was just trapped in this huge selfamplifying system

that was just spiraling towards destruction

And of course I wanted to do something about this

and I felt so small and utterly powerless

But I started to feel a little differently as my perspective shifted

from the macro towards the micro

It began with bumblebees

I was using satellite imagery and field research

to study these amazing cute pollinators

to see how they were doing in the midst of their own environmental crisis

in Southern California

And from the macro view I saw lane freeways

endless suburban sprawl

and water being diverted from parched rivers
par
to grow lawns in the desert

It was pretty grim

But on the ground

there were actually some small opportunities for optimism

these tiny patches of resources

known as habitat fragments

If the right kinds of plants were growing along the edges of a Costco parking lot
Costco
and if in the neighborhoods nearby

there were native plants in people's gardens

and in the canyons that were too steep for people to put their suburbs in

there were native plants instead of grasses

then all of these inbetween spaces

would actually add up to create a network of habitat fragments

And this network meant that the bees could traverse through the concrete desert

feeding from and pollinating the native plants

And these plants that the bees depend on and that the bees sustain are essential

They stabilize our steep hillsides

They provide food and homes to thousands of amazing species of animals

and critically they are helping to curb our devastating cycle of wildfires

by preventing the growth of those invasive grasses

that fuel the vicious flames that we're all too familiar with

It's a really vital and interconnected system

and some people could see how they were a part of it

and so they acted as habitat fragment gardeners

They planted native plants in their yards

and they even were tending to the land in corporate parks

and in public canyons

In my research I could actually see the impact

that even one passionate gardener could make

And then repeated across the region

their habitat fragments were adding up to make a more resilient ecosystem 

not a perfect system not by a long shot

but at least a system that was less likely to totally collapse

under impending pressures like further development and drought

So I was looking at the world through this lens

when I found myself in the waiting room of a public hospital in Brooklyn

with my partner Charles

We were sitting across from a group of teenagers

who were slumped in their chairs

and bored out of their minds

and just refreshing their phones over and over again

And in a neighborhood

with some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the city

this waiting room felt like a social habitat fragment

just waiting to happen

So we did some research to see what kinds of resources could we add

to spaces like this one

that would make an impact

And we settled on museums

Museums are the most trusted source of public information

more than the media and more than the government

but they also cluster in wealthier neighborhoods

New York has  museums in Manhattan

and the Bronx has eight

even though these two boroughs have almost the same size population

And then expensive tickets mean that a lot of people can't go to museums

even if they live nearby

And these little injustices they just go on and on

and they add up to create sweeping inequalities

in knowledge and empowerment

Across the US

almost  percent of visitors to art museums are white

and even at the Smithsonian's network of free museums

almost half of their adult visitors have graduate degrees

which like  percent of the broader population has

So it became clear to us

that even though museums are these amazing educational and social resources

they're not reaching everyone

And a lot of museums are aware of this and they're trying to change it

but there's all these structural hurdles that are slowing them down

So we set out to create a distributed network

of museum habitat fragments

Working from a donated shipping container

with the volunteer help of our friends

and dozens of very generous scientists

from all across the globe

we built our first prototype

the Smallest Mollusk Museum

Laughter

Mollusks are these tentacled slimy shapeshifters

like oysters and octopuses and the giant squid

and if you've ever seen an alien in a movie

then I'll bet you it was inspired by a mollusk

Their slimy scifi vibes

make them really fun tour guides for a biology museum

and they can teach us about the systems that we all share

with a wakeup call

Of all the animal extinctions documented since the s

more than  percent have been our friends the mollusks

So we tested this museum across the city

to see if it resonated with all kinds of visitors

and it did

People really liked learning from it

So we built a fleet of tiny science museums

each one small enough to fit into preexisting locations

with information dense enough that they could still pack a punch

And they're modular so they can be distributed

at a scale that can reach everyone

And then we partnered with libraries

and community centers and transit hubs

and the public hospitals

so that we could transform their inbetween spaces

into habitat fragments for social learning

And fittingly we named our fleet of museums MICRO
 MICRO
Even though each habitat fragment is small

it provides the essentials

It draws people in so that they can explore

and learn together in a social way

And then distributed across the landscape

we're able to invite people everywhere

into conversations around science

When we partnered with a public hospital in the South Bronx

we became the Bronx's first and only science museum

Yeah that's really weird Laughs
 
Laughter

And really quickly

families started coming by with their kids

and schools started arranging field trips

all to this tiny museum in the front lobby of the public hospital

Laughter

And the museum became so popular

that we started hiring local students to be museum docents

so they could lead tours and activities for all the talented kids

And every spark of curiosity that we're able to fuel

and each new fact learned

and every new friend made at the museum

and every kid who can have a meaningful and important afterschool job

it all contributes to a stronger system

So today I try to keep the MICRO view in mind
MICRO
I'm always examining how small actions can add up

to create shifts

at the macro scale of systems

And honestly I'm seeing a lot of really good things

There are habitat fragments everywhere nurtured by talented passionate

strategic individuals in groups of all sizes

who are building towards systems with more equal access to food

and employment health care housing

political empowerment education and healthy environments

One by one together

we're filling gaps

strengthening the systems that we're all a part of

We have to work on the big institutions too of course

It's just that they're so slow

and we're living in the midst of rapid change

It's a defining feature of our time

So maybe in some cases our small actions

can be BandAids until the big guys catch up

But without us what are they going to be catching up to

Am I still scared about the world

Yes Laughs
 
That's why I'm talking to you

The world needs so many more habitat fragments

So if you've been feeling overwhelmed or powerless lately

then I'm asking you to please try this very small strategy on for size

and let's see how it goes

Step one zoom in

It's not one huge system

that's just barreling unstoppably towards destruction

What we have are many overlapping systems

and the ways that they interact determine everything

Step two look for the resource gaps

because that's where you can make the biggest difference

And do some research to understand how your ideas are going to interact

with the systems that are already on the ground

Step three find the other habitat fragments

Find out how they can support you and how you can support them

because we're building a network together

And step four transform your fragment

You might not have the leverage to change multiple systems at once

but there are so many small meaningful and strategic things

that each of us can do

And there are a lot of us

so it will add up

Thank you

Applause

I want you to travel back in time with me

to the before time to 

I don't know if you can remember it

dinosaurs were roaming the earth

I was a security researcher

I had spent about five or six years

doing research on the ways in which APTs
APT
which is short for advanced persistent threats

which stands for nationstate actors

spy on journalists and activists

and lawyers and scientists

and just generally people who speak truth to power

And I'd been doing this for a while

when I discovered that one of my fellow researchers

with whom I had been doing this all this time

was allegedly a serial rapist

So the first thing that I did

was I read a bunch of articles about this

And in January of 

I read an article with some of his alleged victims

And one of the things that really struck me about this article

is how scared they were

They were really frightened

they had you know tape over the cameras on their phones

and on their laptops

and what they were worried about was that he was a hacker

and he was going to hack into their stuff

and he was going to ruin their lives

And this had kept them silent for a really long time

So I was furious

And I didn't want anyone to ever feel that way again

So I did what I usually do when I'm angry

I tweeted

Laughter

And the thing that I tweeted

was that if you are a woman who has been sexually abused by a hacker

and that hacker has threatened to break into your devices

that you could contact me

and I would try to make sure

that your device got a full sort of forensic look over

And then I went to lunch

Laughter

Ten thousand retweets later

Laughter

I had accidentally started a project

So every morning I woke up and my mailbox was full

It was full of the stories of men and women

telling me the worst thing that had ever happened to them

I was contacted by women who were being spied on by men

by men who were being spied on by men

by women who were being spied on by women

but the vast majority of the people contacting me

were women who had been sexually abused by men

who were now spying on them

The one particularly interesting case

involved a man who came to me

because his boyfriend had outed him as gay

to his extremely conservative Korean family

So this is not just menspyingonwomen issue

And I'm here to share

what I learned from this experience

What I learned is that data leaks

It's like water

It gets in places you don't want it

Human leaks

Your friends give away information about you

Your family gives away information about you

You go to a party

somebody tags you as having been there

And this is one of the ways

in which abusers pick up information about you

that you don't otherwise want them to know

It is not uncommon for abusers to go to friends and family

and ask for information about their victims

under the guise of being concerned about their mental health

A form of leak that I saw

was actually what we call account compromise

So your Gmail account
Gmail
your Twitter account
Twitter
your Instagram account
Instagram
your iCloud
iCloud
your Apple ID
Apple ID
your Netflix your TikTok 
NetflixTikTok
I had to figure out what a TikTok was
TikTok
If it had a login

I saw it compromised

And the reason for that is because your abuser is not always your abuser

It is really common for people in relationships to share passwords

Furthermore people who are intimate

who know a lot about each other

can guess each other's security questions

Or they can look over each other's shoulders

to see what code they're using in order to lock their phones

They frequently have physical access to the phone

or they have physical access to the laptop

And this gives them a lot of opportunity

to do things to people's accounts

which is very dangerous

The good news is that we have advice

for people to lock down their accounts

This advice already exists and it comes down to this

Use strong unique passwords for all of your accounts

Use more strong unique passwords

as the answers to your security questions

so that somebody who knows the name of your childhood pet

can't reset your password

And finally turn on the highest level of twofactor authentication

that you're comfortable using

So that even if an abuser manages to steal your password

because they don't have the second factor

they will not be able to log into your account

The other thing that you should do

is you should take a look at the security and privacy tabs

for most of your accounts

Most accounts have a security or privacy tab

that tells you what devices are logging in

and it tells you where they're logging in from

For example here I am

logging in to Facebook from the La Quinta
La QuintaFacebook
where we are having this meeting

and if for example

I took a look at my Facebook logins
Facebook
and I saw somebody logging in from Dubai

I would find that suspicious

because I have not been to Dubai in some time

But sometimes it really is a RAT
RAT
If by RAT you mean remote access tool
RAT
And remote access tool

is essentially what we mean when we say stalkerware

So one of the reasons why getting full access to your device

is really tempting for governments

is the same reason why getting full access to your device

is tempting for abusive partners and former partners

We carry tracking devices around in our pockets all day long

We carry devices that contain all of our passwords

all of our communications

including our endtoend encrypted communications

All of our emails all of our contacts

all of our selfies are all in one place

often our financial information is also in this place

And so full access to a persons phone

is the next best thing to full access to a person's mind

And what stalkerware does is it gives you this access

So you may ask how does it work

The way stalkerware works

is that it's a commercially available program

which an abuser purchases

installs on the device that they want to spy on

usually because they have physical access

or they can trick their target into installing it themselves

by saying you know

This is a very important program you should install on your device

And then they pay the stalkerware company

for access to a portal

which gives them all of the information from that device

And you're usually paying something like  bucks a month

So this kind of spying is remarkably cheap

Do these companies know

that their tools

are being used as tools of abuse

Absolutely

If you take a look at the marketing copy for Cocospy
Cocospy
which is one of these products

it says right there on the website

that Cocospy allows you to spy on your wife with ease
Cocospy
You do not have to worry about where she goes

who she talks to or what websites she visits

So that's creepy

HelloSpy which is another such product
HelloSpy
had a marketing page in which they spent most of their copy

talking about the prevalence of cheating

and how important it is to catch your partner cheating

including this fine picture of a man

who has clearly just caught his partner cheating

and has beaten her

She has a black eye there is blood on her face

And I don't think that there is really a lot of question

about whose side HelloSpy is on in this particular case
HelloSpy
And who they're trying to sell their product to

It turns out that if you have stalkerware on your computer or on your phone

it can be really difficult to know whether or not it's there

And one of the reasons for that

is because antivirus companies

often don't recognize stalkerware as malicious

They don't recognize it as a Trojan

or as any of the other stuff that you would normally find

that they would warn you about

These are some results from earlier this year from VirusTotal
VirusTotal
I think that for one sample that I looked at

I had something like a result of seven out of 

of the platforms recognized the stalkerware that I was testing

And here is another one where I managed to get 

 out of 

So this is still some very bad results

I have managed to convince a couple of antivirus companies

to start marking stalkerware as malicious

So that all you have to do

if you're worried about having this stuff on your computer

is you download the program

you run a scan and it tells you

Hey there's some potentially unwanted program on your device

It gives you the option of removing it

but it does not remove it automatically

And one of the reasons for that

is because of the way that abuse works

Frequently victims of abuse aren't sure

whether or not they want to tip off their abuser

by cutting off their access

Or they're worried that their abuser is going to escalate to violence

or perhaps even greater violence

than they've already been engaging in

Kaspersky was one of the very first companies

that said that they were going to start taking this seriously

And in November of this year

they issued a report in which they said

that since they started tracking stalkerware among their users

that they had seen an increase of  percent

Likewise Lookout came out with a statement
Lookout
saying that they were going to take this much more seriously

And finally a company called Malwarebytes also put out such a statement
Malwarebytes
and said that they had found  programs

in the time that they had been looking

which could be classified as stalkerware

Finally in November I helped to launch a coalition

called the Coalition Against Stalkerware

made up of academics

people who are doing this sort of thing on the ground 

the practitioners of helping people to escape from intimate partner violence 

and antivirus companies

And our goal is both to educate people about these programs

but also to convince the antivirus companies

to change the norm

in how they act around this very scary software

so that soon if I get up in front of you

and I talk to you about this next year

I could tell you that the problem has been solved

and all you have to do is download any antivirus

and it is considered normal for it to detect stalkerware

That is my hope

Thank you very much

It's deeply painful

to face what's happening on our planet right now

From forests burning

ocean plastic

species just gone each day

displacement

It's easy to feel totally overwhelmed

Maybe a bit helpless

Powerless

Angry

On fire

Numb

Disconnected

Perhaps all of the above

These messy and complicated feelings

they make total sense

I wish that someone had said this to me  years ago

I was a college freshman taking environmental studies

which is basically a semester of really bad news

about all the ways that humans have profoundly damaged

our beautiful earth

And I felt like I had been dropped into a dark tunnel

given no tools to get out

and yet expected to carry on with my everyday life

as if things were normal

But once you're exposed to that kind of information

things are not normal anymore

And I was anxious I was terrified

no one was talking about this

and I almost dropped out of school for real

But instead I signed up for a field study in California

and we were backpacking together as a small group for two months

which I know sounds very intense

And it was but what I found is that we talked a lot

We talked about how we were feeling

about the world

openly and honestly

and no one told me at any point to be more positive

or more hopeful

Not once

And surprisingly I found myself feeling better

I actually felt like I could face these issues

that had seemed so insurmountable

more head on

And I had this epiphany

What if by understanding ourselves

and one another

we could find our way through this crisis

in a new and different way

You know what if psychology actually held

a missing key to unlocking action

on the greatest challenges facing our planet right now

So when I got back from the field study

I focused on clinical psychology

and I researched the relationships

between trauma and grief and creativity

And the paradox at the heart of I think all of this

is how do we stay present

with what's really painful

how do we stay connected

in the face of what's threatening and overwhelming and scary

And it turns out that psychology knows a lot about these things

Truly a lot

But I wasn't hearing any of this being referenced

in my environmental studies class

or the climate action meetings I started going to

or the international conferences

where everyone is asking

Why aren't we acting faster and what's it going to take

And so this has become my mission of sorts

which is that I take insights from psychology

and I translate them into resources and tools

to support those working on the frontlines to turn things around

And that means for anyone by the way

We're all on the frontlines right now

And it's my belief

after years of straddling these worlds

between environment and climate and psychology

that this actually is a missing ingredient in our work

that can exponentially accelerate our capacities to be creative

and resilient and capable and skillful and courageous

and all those things that the world is needing from us right now

So I'm going to share three concepts with you

that I found particularly gamechanging

and how I make sense of this moment

for us as humans

And the first is something called our window of tolerance

So Dr Dan Siegel has described us all as having a window
Dan Siegel
How much stress can we tolerate

while staying connected

and what clinicians would call integrated

Integrated where we can actually

be in touch with our thoughts and feelings

and not just get kind of coopted

And we all have a threshold

And what happens when we experience stress

beyond what we can tolerate

We tend to go into the edges of our window

And on one hand

we might go into a sort of collapse

what's called a chaotic response

which looks like depression despair

kind of a shutting down

And on the other side of this window is a more rigid response

denial

anger

rigid

And so when that happens

we actually lose our capacity to be integrated

resilient adaptive

all those things that we want to be

And this is totally normal

but it's happening all around the world right now right

We're all vacillating between these different feelings and emotions

And so with something like climate change

with every new scientific report

documentary

connecting the dots between you know what we're doing

and the impact it's having

it can collectively be pushing us outside of our window of tolerance

And we lose that capacity right

So over the years I've interviewed hundreds of people

from all backgrounds and political affiliations

from the Midwest US to China

and I talked to people about how are we feeling

about what's happening

Not what opinions or beliefs

What are we feeling

about what's going on with your local environment

with your water your soil the big picture

And what I hear from people

almost across the board I'm telling you

is a bind

People tell me at some point in the conversation

I care very deeply about what's happening

I'm incredibly freaked out

I'm scared

I love this land I love the birds

whatever that is

But I feel like my actions are insignificant

And I don't know where to start

And I'm also 

I hear between the lines of what people say 

I'm really scared to change

Really scared of any change it's so 

I can't even think about it it's like unthinkable

And this is the second concept

which is something called a double bind

And a double bind is when we feel sort of like damned if you do

and damned if you don't

and you're just kind of stuck there

It's a very intolerable human experience

And we will do anything we can to get rid of it and just push it away

And so all that care and concern

it's there it just goes down it goes underground

But what happens is

it looks like people don't care it looks like apathy

And so a lot of folks who are seeing the urgency of the situation

are like We've got to motivate you

We've got to get you psyched

And we become cheerleaders for solutions

Or like Here's the facts this is happening wake up

And these things are actually not inherently bad

because we need solutions and we need to face the facts

But inadvertently this can backfire

and lead to more numbing and inaction

which is very perplexing for a lot of people

It's like what the heck is going on right

And so this is because of this you know

it's not really touching what's going on underneath

So imagine that you go see a therapist

and you've got a double bind

You're feeling really stuck

you know you've got to change

and the therapist starts shouting at you

and saying Dont you see what's happening

If you don't act now

you're going to face terrifying consequences

Dont you care

What's wrong with you

What's it going to take

Or you see a therapist and you're feeling actually sad

and grief

And this therapist says

You know don't think about it too much

Here's some simple things you can do

Simple positive things

And sends you on your way

So if it were me

I would fire this therapist immediately

because a good therapist practices something called attunement

I love this concept so much

Attunement right the word to tune

And attunement is when we're feeling in sync

when we feel understood

and we feel accepted for exactly where we are

And we feel that you know

we're in relationship with the world in a way that makes sense

no one's trying to change us

or shame us or judge us

Right

And attunement takes skill

When the stakes are high

let me tell you it's very hard to want to attune with anything

when we're facing such urgent threats

But the paradox of the moment we're in

is that when we are more in tune in our window of tolerance

we are so much more capable of solving problems

being creative being adaptive

being flexible

being our brilliant selves right

So what if our climate and environmental work

was informed by these concepts right

of window of tolerance

lot of double binds

and attunement

So it can look like a whole lot of things

So I'm asked all the time

OK Renee this sounds awesome for a clinical context

we don't have time for this

And that is absolutely not true

Because we can bring attunement

into every aspect of our work on this issue

And it starts with ourselves

You actually can't do attunement unless you're in touch with yourself

I'm sorry to break it to you

There's no way around it

It's from the inside out

And so it starts with actually tuning in to how am I feeling

And being compassionate

I know it's easy to say

but really being compassionate

it's like these are hard issues

This is a hard moment to be a human being

we're waking up

I'm not a bad person

What's going on

bring curiosity into our own experience

which then allows us to attune socially

that's the next way we can apply this

is attuning whether it's in small groups

or oneonone

campaigning strategy classrooms movie theaters

parks

Where we can give each other permission to just be who we are

and again this allows us to move

into the higher level functioning

The executive function the prefrontal cortex

when we feel that our nervous system can calm down

and we are understood by the other

And the third way is leading with attunement

As leaders and influencers

showing up as human as real

saying You know what

I am really scared

I don't know what all the answers are

Can you imagine leaders saying that

I don't know

But here we are and we're all needed

And we're in this together

And we can do this

That's a very different message than just We can do this right

It's like Here we are

I'm scared but this is happening

So here's the thing

all of this work exists

we have the tools to create these conditions

that can allow us to show up

as our brilliant selves

And I know without doubt  percent

that each one of us has the capacity

to meet these challenges with the ingenuity

and brilliance and bravery that we as humans have

We just need to cultivate the conditions together

We need each other

To support each other

and allow ourselves to really meet this

That's what we need so 

Let's take a deep breath

Have compassion for ourselves

and one another in this moment time in history

so we collectively process these painful truths

these difficult realities

Let's do this together

The world is ready for us to do this

And we can do this

Thank you

I was an eightyearold kid in the mids

I grew up in southern Philippines

At that age you're young enough to be oblivious

about what society expects from each of us

but old enough to be aware of what's going on around you

We lived in a onebedroom house

all five of us

Our house was amongst clusters of houses

made mostly of wood and corrugated metal sheets

These houses were built very close to each other

along unpaved roads

There was little to no expectation of privacy

Whenever an argument broke out next door

you heard it all

Or if there was a little  something something going on 
 
Laughter

you would probably hear that too

Laughter

Like any other kid I learned what a family looked like

It was a man a woman plus a child or children

But I also learned it wasn't always that way

There were other combinations that worked just as well

There was this family of three who lived down the street

The lady of the house was called Lenie

Lenie had long black hair often in a ponytail
Lenie
and manicured nails

She always went out with a little makeup on

and her signature red lipstick

Lenie's other half I don't remember much about him

except that he had a thing for white sleeveless shirts

and gold chains around his neck

Their daughter was a couple years younger than me

Now everybody in the village knew Lenie

She owned and ran what was the most popular beauty salon

in our side of town

Every time their family would walk down the roads

they would always be greeted with smiles

and occasionally stopped for a little chitchat

Now the interesting thing about Lenie

is that she also happened to be a transgender woman

She exemplified one of the Philippines' longstanding stories

about gender diversity

Lenie was proof that oftentimes we think of something as strange

only because we're not familiar with it

or we haven't taken enough time to try and understand

In most cultures around the world

gender is this manwoman dichotomy

It's this immovable nonnegotiable distinct classes of individuals

We assign characteristics and expectations

the moment a person's biological sex is determined

But not all cultures are like that

Not all cultures are as rigid

Many cultures don't look at genitalia primarily

as basis for gender construction

and some communities in North America Africa the Indian subcontinent

and the Pacific Islands including the Philippines

have a long history of cultural permissiveness

and accommodation of gender variances

As you may know

the people of the Philippines were under Spanish rule for over  years

That's from  to 

This explains why everyday Filipino conversations

are peppered with Spanish words

and why so many of our last names including mine sound very Spanish

This also explains the firmly entrenched influence of Catholicism

But precolonial Philippine societies

they were mostly animists

They believed all things had a distinct spiritual essence

plants animals rocks rivers places

Power resided in the spirit

Whoever was able to harness that spiritual power was highly revered

Now scholars who have studied the Spanish colonial archives

also tell us that these early societies were largely egalitarian

Men did not necessarily have an advantage over women

Wives were treated as companions not slaves

And family contracts were not done without their presence and approval

In some ways women had the upper hand

A woman could divorce her husband and own property under her own name

which she kept even after marriage

She had the prerogative to have a baby or not

and then decide the baby's name

But the real key to the power of the precolonial Filipino woman

was in her role as babaylan
 babaylan
a collective term for shamans of various ethnic groups

They were the community healers

specialists in herbal and divine lore

They delivered babies

and communicated with the spirit world

They performed exorcisms

and occasionally and in defense of their community

they kicked some ass

Laughter

And while the babaylan was a female role
babaylan
there were also in fact male practitioners in the spiritual realm

Reports from early Spanish chroniclers contain several references

to male shamans who did not conform to normative Western masculine standards

They crossdressed

and appeared effeminate

or sexually ambiguous
big
A Jesuit missionary named Francisco Alcina
Francisco Alcina
said that one man he believed to be a shaman

was so effeminate

that in every way he was more a woman than a man

All the things the women did

he performed

such as weaving blankets

sewing clothes and making pots

He danced also like they did

never like a man

whose dance is different

In all he appeared more a woman than a man

Well any other juicy details in the colonial archives

Thought you'd never ask

Laughter

As you may have deduced by now

the manner in which these precolonial societies conducted themselves

didn't go over so well

All the freeloving gendervariantpermitting

gender equality wokeness

clashed viciously with the European sensibilities at the time

so much so that the Spanish missionaries spent the next  years

trying to enforce their twosex twogender model

Many Spanish friars also thought that the crossdressing babaylan
babaylan
were either celibates like themselves

or had deficient or malformed genitals

But this was pure speculation

Documents compiled between  and  called The Bolinao Manuscript

mentions male shamans marrying women

The Boxer Codex circa 

provide clues on the nature of the male babaylan sexuality

It says Ordinarily they dress as women

act like prudes

and are so effeminate

that one who does know them would believe they are women

Almost all are impotent for the reproductive act

and thus they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife

and have carnal knowledge

Carnal knowledge of course meaning sex

Now there's an ongoing debate in contemporary society

about what constitutes gender and how it should be defined

My country is no exception

Some countries like Australia New Zealand Pakistan Nepal and Canada

have begun introducing nonbinary options in their legal documents

such as their passports and their permanent resident cards

In all these discussions about gender

I think it's important to keep in mind

that the prevailing notions of man and woman as static genders

anchored strictly on biological sex

are social constructs

In my people's case this social construct is an imposition

It was hammered into their heads over hundreds of years

until they were convinced that their way of thinking was erroneous

But the good thing about social constructs

is they can be reconstructed

to fit a time and age

They can be reconstructed

to respond to communities that are becoming more diverse

And they can be reconstructed

for a world that's starting to realize

we have so much to gain from learning and working through our differences

When I think about this subject

I think about the Filipino people

and an almost forgotten but important legacy

of gender equality and inclusivity

I think about lovers who were some of the gentlest souls I had known

but could not be fully open

I think about people who have made an impact in my life

who showed me that integrity kindness and strength of character

are far better measures of judgment

far better than things that are beyond a person's control

such as their skin color their age

or their gender

As I stand here today on the shoulders of people like Lenie

I feel incredibly grateful for all who have come before me

the ones courageous enough to put themselves out there

who lived a life that was theirs

and in the process made it a little easier for us to live our lives now

Because being yourself is revolutionary

And to anyone reeling from forces trying to knock you down

and cram you into these neat little boxes people have decided for you

don't break

I see you

My ancestors see you

Their blood runs through me as they run through so many of us

You are valid and you deserve rights and recognition

just like everyone else

Thank you

Applause

I'm an artist and an engineer

And lately I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates

the way we perceive reality

And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way

Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality

by masking itself as the actual experience of the world

As a result we are becoming unconscious and unaware

that it is happening at all

Take the glasses I usually wear for example

These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings

I barely notice them

even though they are constantly framing reality for me

The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing

change what we see and think

but go unnoticed

Now the only time I do notice my glasses

is when something happens to draw my attention to it

like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes

So I asked myself As an artist what can I create

to draw the same kind of attention

to the ways digital media  like news organizations social media platforms

advertising and search engines 

are shaping our reality

So I created a series of perceptual machines

to help us defamiliarize and question

the ways we see the world

For example nowadays many of us have this kind of allergic reaction

to ideas that are different from ours

We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy

So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red

It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger

when you are wearing it

It has two modes nocebo and placebo
nocebo
In nocebo mode it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy
nocebo
Whenever I see red the red expands

It's similar to social media's amplification effect

like when you look at something that bothers you

you tend to stick with likeminded people

and exchange messages and memes and you become even more angry

Sometimes a trivial discussion gets amplified

and blown way out of proportion

Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger

In placebo mode it's an artificial cure for this allergy

Whenever you see red the red shrinks

It's a palliative like in digital media

When you encounter people with different opinions

we will unfollow them

remove them completely out of our feeds

It cures this allergy by avoiding it

But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas

makes human community hyperfragmented and separated

The device inside the helmet reshapes reality

and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses

to create an augmented reality

I picked the color red because it's intense and emotional

it has high visibility

and it's political

So what if we take a look

at the last American presidential election map

through the helmet

Laughter

You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican

because the mediation alters our perceptions

The allergy exists on both sides

In digital media

what we see every day is often mediated

but it's also very nuanced

If we are not aware of this

we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies

Our perception is not only part of our identities

but in digital media it's also a part of the value chain

Our visual field is packed with so much information

that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value

Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases

algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions

so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized

to sell ads

Like when this little red dot comes out in your notifications

it grows and expands and to your mind it's huge

So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt

or change the lenses of my glasses

and came up with another project

Now keep in mind this is conceptual It's not a real product
 
It's a web browser plugin

that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore

Like the helmet the plugin reshapes reality

but this time directly into the digital media itself

It shouts out the hidden filtered voices

What you should be noticing now

will be bigger and vibrant

like here this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats

Laughter

The plugin could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm

Like here in this comment section

there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions

The plugin makes their comments super small

Laughter

So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen

is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation

Laughter

Applause

The plugin also shows the real estate value of our visual field

and how much of our perception is being commoditized

Different from ad blockers

for every ad you see on the web page

it shows the amount of money you should be earning

Laughter

We are living in a battlefield between reality

and commercial distributed reality

so the next version of the plugin could strike away that commercial reality

and show you things as they really are

Laughter

Applause

Well you can imagine how many directions this could really go

Believe me I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product

And I created this with good intentions

to train our perception and eliminate biases

But the same approach could be used with bad intentions

like forcing citizens to install a plugin like that

to control the public narrative

It's challenging to make it fair and personal

without it just becoming another layer of mediation

So what does all this mean for us

Even though technology is creating this isolation

we could use it to make the world connected again

by breaking the existing model and going beyond it

By exploring how we interface with these technologies

we could step out of our habitual almost machinelike behavior

and finally find common ground between each other

Technology is never neutral

It provides a context and frames reality

It's part of the problem and part of the solution

We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception

and consequently choose how we see each other

Thank you

Transcriber Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez
Joseph Geni
Six months ago

I watched with bated breath

as NASA's InSight lander descended towards the surface of Mars
NASAInSight
Two hundred meters

 meters

    meters

Receiving confirmation of successful touchdown

was one of the most ecstatic moments of my life

And hearing that news was possible because of two small cube sets

that went along to Mars with InSight
InSight
Those two cube sets essentially livestreamed InSight's telemetry
InSight
back to Earth

so that we could watch in nearreal time

as that InSight lander went screaming towards the surface of the red planet
InSight
hitting the atmosphere of Mars

at a top speed of about  miles per hour

Now that event was livestreamed to us

from over  million miles away

It was livestreamed from Mars

Meanwhile

the two Voyager spacecraft 

now these are these two almost unbelievably intrepid explorers

They were launched

the same year that all of us here were being introduced to Han Solo
Han Solo
for the first time

And they are still sending back data from interstellar space

over  years later

We are sending more spacecraft further into deep space

than ever before

But every one of those spacecraft out there

depends on its navigation being performed

right here at Earth

to tell it where it is and far more importantly

where it is going

And we have to do that navigation here on Earth for one simple reason

spacecraft are really bad at telling the time

But if we can change that

we can revolutionize the way we explore deep space

Now I am a deep space navigator

and I know you're probably thinking What is that job

Well it is an extremely unique and also very fun job

I steer spacecraft

from the moment they separate from their launch vehicle

to when they reach their destination in space

And these destinations  say Mars for example or Jupiter 

they are really far away

To put my job in context for you

it's like me standing here in Los Angeles and shooting an arrow

and with that arrow I hit a target that's the size of a quarter

and that target the size of a quarter is sitting in Times Square New York

Now I have the opportunity to adjust the course of my spacecraft

a few times along that trajectory

but in order to do that I need to know where it is

And tracking a spacecraft as it travels through deep space

is fundamentally a problem of measuring time

You see I can't just pull out my ruler and measure how far away my spacecraft is

But I can measure

how long it takes a signal to get there and back again

And the concept is exactly the same as an echo

If I stand in front of a mountain and I shout

the longer it takes for me to hear my echo back at me

the further away that mountain is

So we measure that signal time very very accurately

because getting it wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second

might mean the difference between your spacecraft safely and gently landing

on the surface of another planet

or creating yet another crater on that surface

Just a tiny fraction of a second

and it can be the difference between a mission's life or death

So we measure that signal time very very accurately here on Earth

down to better than onebillionth of a second

But it has to be measured here on Earth

There's this great imbalance of scale when it comes to deep space exploration

Historically we have been able to send smallish things extremely far away

thanks to very large things here on our home planet

As an example this is the size of a satellite dish

that we use to talk to these spacecraft in deep space

And the atomic clocks that we use for navigation are also large

The clocks and all of their supporting hardware

can be up to the size of a refrigerator

Now if we even want to talk about sending that capability into deep space

that refrigerator needs to shrink down

into something that can fit inside the produce drawer

So why does this matter

Well let's revisit one of our intrepid explorers Voyager 

Voyager  is just over  billion miles away right now

As you know it took over  years to get there

and it takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over  hours

to get there and back again

And here's the thing about these spacecraft

they move really fast

And Voyager  doesn't stop and wait for us to send directions from Earth

Voyager  keeps moving

In that  hours that we are waiting

to hear that echo signal here on the Earth

Voyager  has moved on by about  million miles

It's  million miles further into largely uncharted territory

So it would be great

if we could measure that signal time directly at the spacecraft

But the miniaturization of atomic clock technology is 

well it's difficult

Not only does the clock technology and all the supporting hardware

need to shrink down

but you also need to make it work

Space is an exceptionally harsh environment

and if one piece breaks on this instrument

it's not like we can just send a technician out to replace the piece

and continue on our way

The journeys that these spacecraft take can last months years

even decades

And designing and building a precision instrument that can support that

is as much an art as it is a science and an engineering

But there is good news we are making some amazing progress

and we're about to take our very first baby steps

into a new age of atomic space clocks

Soon we will be launching

an ionbased atomic clock that is spacesuitable

And this clock has the potential to completely flip the way we navigate

This clock is so stable

it measures time so well

that if I put it right here and I turned it on

and I walked away

I would have to come back nine million years later

for that clock's measurement to be off by one second

So what can we do with a clock like this

Well instead of doing all of the spacecraft navigation

here on the Earth

what if we let the spacecraft navigate themselves

Onboard autonomous navigation or a selfdriving spacecraft if you will

is one of the top technologies needed

if we are going to survive in deep space

When we inevitably send humans to Mars or even further

we need to be navigating that ship in real time

not waiting for directions to come from Earth

And measuring that time wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second

can mean the difference between a mission's life or death

which is bad enough for a robotic mission

but just think about the consequences if there was a human crew on board

But let's assume that we can get our astronauts

safely to the surface of their destination

Once they're there I imagine they'd like a way to find their way around

Well with this clock technology

we can now build GPSlike navigation systems
GPS
at other planets and moons

Imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars
GPS
Can you see an astronaut standing on the surface of Mars

with Olympus Mons rising in the background
Olympus Mons
and she's looking down at her Google Maps Mars Edition
Google Maps Mars Edition
to see where she is

and to chart a course to get where she needs to go

Allow me to dream for a moment

and let's talk about something far far in the future

when we are sending humans to places much further away than Mars

places where waiting for a signal from the Earth in order to navigate

is just not realistic

Imagine in this scenario that we can have a constellation

a network of communication satellites scattered throughout deep space

broadcasting navigation signals

and any spacecraft picking up that signal

can travel from destination to destination to destination

with no direct tie to the Earth at all

The ability to accurately measure time in deep space

can forever change the way we navigate

But it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science

You see that same signal that we use for navigation

tells us something about where it came from

and the journey that it took as it traveled from antenna to antenna

And that journey that gives us data data to build better models

better models of planetary atmospheres throughout our solar system

We can detect subsurface oceans on faroff icy moons

maybe even detect tiny ripples in space due to relativistic gravity

Onboard autonomous navigation means we can support more spacecraft

more sensors to explore the universe

and it also frees up navigators  people like me 

to work on finding the answers to other questions

And we still have a lot of questions to answer

We know such precious little about this universe around us

In recent years we have discovered nearly  planetary systems

outside of our own solar system

and those systems are home to almost  exoplanets

To put that number in context for you

when I was learning about planets for the first time as a child

there were nine

or eight if you didn't count Pluto

But now there are 

It is estimated that dark matter

makes up about  percent of our universe

and we don't even know what it is

All of the science returned

from all of our deep space missions combined

is just this single drop of knowledge

in a vast ocean of questions

And if we want to learn more

to discover more to understand more

then we need to explore more

The ability to accurately keep time in deep space

will revolutionize the way that we can explore this universe

and it might just be one of the keys to unlocking some of those secrets

that she holds so dear

Thank you

I'm going to start by saying something you think you know to be true

Your brain creates all facets of your mind

So then why do we treat mental and physical illnesses

so differently

if we think we know that the mind comes from the brain

As a neuroscientist I'm often told

that I'm not allowed to study how internal states

like anxiety or craving or loneliness

are represented by the brain

and so I decided to set out and do exactly that

My research program is designed to understand the mind

by investigating brain circuits

Specifically how does our brain give rise to emotion

It's really hard to study feelings and emotions

because you can't measure them

Behavior is still the best and only window

into the emotional experience of another

For both animals and people

yes selfreport is a behavioral output

Motivated behaviors fall into two general classes

seeking pleasure and avoiding pain

The ability to approach things that are good for you

and avoid things that are bad for you

is fundamental to survival

And in our modernday society

trouble telling the difference can be labeled as a mental illness

If I was having car trouble

and I took my car to the mechanic

the first thing they do is look under the hood

But with mental health research

you can't just pop open the hood with the press of a button

So this is why we do experiments on animals

Specifically in my lab mice

To understand the brain well we need to study brains

And for the first time we actually can

We can pop open the hood

We can look inside

and do an experiment and see what comes out

Technology has opened new windows into the black box that is our minds

The development of optogenetic tools

has allowed us unprecedented control over specific neurons in the brain

and how they talk to each other by firing electrical signals

We can genetically engineer neurons to be light sensitive

and then use light to control how neurons fire

This can change an animal's behavior

giving us insight into what that neural circuit can do

Want to know how scientists figure this out

Scientists developed optogenetic tools by borrowing knowledge

from other basic science fields

Algae are singlecelled organisms that have evolved to swim towards light

And when blue light shines onto the eyespot of an algae cell

a channel opens sending an electrical signal

that makes little flagella flap

and propels the algae towards sunlight

If we clone this lightsensitive part of the algae

and then add it to neurons through genetic modification

we can make neurons lightsensitive too

Except with neurons

when we shine light down an optical fiber deep into the brain

we change how they send electrical signals to other neurons in the brain

and thus change the animal's behavior

With the help of my colleagues

I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools

to selectively target neurons that are living in point A
A
sending messages down wires aimed at point B
B
leaving neighboring neurons going other places unaffected

This approach allowed us to test the function of each wire

within the tangled mess that is our brain

A brain region called the amygdala

has long been thought to be important for emotion

and my laboratory discovered

that the amygdala resembles a fork in the road

where activating one path can drive positive emotion and approach

and activating another path can drive negative emotion and avoidance

I'm going to show you a couple of examples 

a taste of raw data 

of how we can use optogenetics to target specific neurons in the brain

and get very specific changes in behavior

Anxiety patients have abnormal communication

between two parts of the amygdala

but in people it's hard to know if this abnormality is cause or effect

of the disease

We can use optogenetics to target the same pathway in a mouse

and see what happens

So this is the elevated plus maze

It's a widely used anxiety test

that measures the amount of time

that the mouse spends in the safety of the closed arms

relative to exploring the open arms

Mice have evolved to prefer enclosed spaces

like the safety of their burrows

but to find food water mates

they need to go out into the open

where they're more vulnerable to predatory threats

So I'm sitting in the background here

and I'm about to flip the switch

And now when I flip the switch and turn the light on

you can see the mouse begins to explore the open arms of the maze more

And in contrast to drug treatments for anxiety

there's no sedation no locomotor impairment

just coordinated naturallooking exploration

So not only is the effect almost immediate

but there are no detectable side effects

Now when I flip the switch off

you can see that the mouse goes back to its normal brain function

and back to its corner

When I was in the lab and I was taking these data

I was all by myself and I was so excited

I was so excited I did one of these quiet screams

Silently Aah

Laughter

Why was I so excited

I mean yeah theoretically I knew that the brain controlled the mind

but to flip the switch with my hand

and see the mouse change its behavioral state

so rapidly and so reversibly

it was really the first time that I truly believed it

Since that first breakthrough

there have been a number of other discoveries

Finding specific neural circuits that can elicit dramatic changes

in animal behavior

Here's another example compulsive overeating

We can eat for two reasons

Seeking pleasure like tasty food

or avoiding pain like being hungry

How can we find a treatment for compulsive overeating

without messing up the hungerdriven feeding

that we need to survive

The first step is to understand

how the brain gives rise to feeding behavior

This fullyfed mouse is just exploring a space

completely devoid of any food

Here we're using optogenetics to target neurons living in the hypothalamus

sending messages down wires aimed at the midbrain

When I turn the light on right here

you can see that the mouse immediately begins licking the floor

Laughter

This seemingly frenzied behavior

is about to escalate into something I find really incredible

It's kind of trippy actually

Ready

It's right here

See he picks up his hands as if he is eating a piece of food

but there's nothing there he's not holding anything

So this circuit is sufficient to drive feeding behavior

in the absence of hunger

even in the absence of food

I can't know for sure how this mouse is feeling

but I speculate these neurons drive craving

based on the behaviors we elicit when we target this pathway

Turn the light back off 

animal's back to normal

When we silence this pathway

we can suppress and reduce compulsive overeating

without altering hungerdriven feeding

What did you take away from these two videos

that I just showed you

That making a very specific change to neural circuits in the brain

can have specific changes to behavior

That every conscious experience that we have

is governed by cells in our brain

I am the daughter of a physicist and a biologist

who literally met on the boat coming to America

in pursuit of an education

So naturally

since there was no pressure to be a scientist 

Laughter

as a college student

I had to decide whether I wanted to focus on psychology the study of the mind

or neuroscience the study of the brain

And I chose neuroscience

because I wanted to understand how the mind is born

out of biological tissue

But really I've come full circle to do both

And now my research program

bridges the gap between the mind and the brain

Research from my laboratory

suggests that we can begin to tie specific neural circuits

to emotional states

And we have found a number of circuits

that control anxietyrelated behavior

compulsive overeating

social interaction avoidance

and many other types of motivated behaviors

that may reflect internal emotional states

We used to think of functions of the mind as being defined by brain regions

But my work shows that within a given brain region

there are many different neurons doing different things

And these functions are partly defined by the paths they take

Here's a metaphor to help illustrate

how these discoveries change the way that we think about the brain

Let's say that the brain is analogous to the world

and that neurons are analogous to people

And we want to understand how information is transmitted across the planet

Sure it's useful to know

where a given person is located when recording what they're saying

But I would argue that it's equally important

to know who this person is talking to

who is listening

and how the people listening respond to the information that they receive

The current state of mental health treatment

is essentially a strategy of trial and error

And it is not working

The development of new drug therapies for mental health disorders

has hit a brick wall

with scarcely any real progress since the s

So what does the future hold

In the near future

I expect to see a mental health treatment revolution

where we focus on specific neural circuits in the brain

Diagnoses will be made based on both behavioral symptoms

and measurable brain activity

Further in the future

by combining our ability to make acute changes to the brain

and get acute changes to behavior

with our knowledge of synaptic plasticity to make more permanent changes

we could push the brain into a state of fixing itself

by reprogramming neural circuits

Exposure therapy at the circuit level

Once we switch the brain into a state of selfhealing

this could potentially have longlasting effects

with no side effects

I can envision a future where neural circuit reprogramming

represents a potential cure not just a treatment

OK but what about right now

If from this very moment forward

each and every one of you left this talk

and truly believed that the mind comes entirely from cells in your brain

then we could immediately get rid of negative perceptions and stigmas

that prevent so many people

from getting the mental health support that they need

Mental health professionals

we're always thinking about what's the next new treatment

But before we can apply new treatments

we need people to feel comfortable seeking them

Imagine how dramatically we could reduce the rates of suicides

and school shootings

if everyone who needed mental health support actually got it

When we truly understand exactly how the mind comes from the brain

we will improve the lives of everyone

who will have a mental illness in their lifetime 

half the population 

as well as everyone else with whom they share the world

Thank you

I came back to my home of Rwanda

two years after the  genocide against the Tutsi

The country was devastated

The children I was caring for in the hospitals

were dying from treatable conditions

because we didn't have equipment or medicine to save them

I was tempted to pack my bag and run away

But I debated with myself

And because I'm really dedicated to social justice and equity

and there were only five pediatricians in total

for millions of children in Rwanda

I decided to stay

But among the people who have motivated my decision to stay

there were some fantastic women of Rwanda

some women who had faced the genocide and survived it

They had to overcome unbelievable pain and suffering

Some of them were raising children conceived through rape

Others were dying slowly with HIV

and forgave the perpetrators who voluntarily infected them

using HIV and rape as a weapon

So they inspired me

If they can do that

I can stay and try to do my best

Those ladies were really activists

of peace and reconciliation

They show us a way to rebuild a country

for our children and grandchildren to have one day

a place they can call home with pride

And you can ask yourself

where this shift of mindset has brought our country

Today in Rwanda

we have the highest percentage of women in parliament

Applause

Wait till I tell you the percentage 

sixtyone percent

Applause

Today we have the best campaign for the vaccination of children

with among our success  percent of our girls vaccinated against HPV 
HPV
Applause

to protect them against cervical cancer

In this country it's 

Laughter

We have reduced child mortality by  percent

maternal mortality by  percent

In early s

there were nine women who were dying every day

around delivery and pregnancy

Today it's around two

It's an unfinished agenda

We still have a long way to go

Two is still too much

But do I believe that those results

are because we had a big number of women

in power positions

I do

Laughter

There is  yes 

Applause

there is a study in the developing world

that shows that if you improve the status of women

you improve the status of the community where they live

Up to  percent of decrease in child mortality

And even in this country where we are now

it's true

There is a study by a lady called Patricia Homan
Patricia Homan
who projected that if women and men

were at parity in state legislatures

there would be a drop of  percent in child mortality 

in America

So we know that women

when they use their skills in leadership positions

they enhance the entire population they are in charge of

And imagine what would happen

if women were at parity with men all over the world

What a huge benefit we could expect

Hmm

Oh yeah

Applause

Because in general

we have a different style of leadership

more inclusive

more empathetic

more caring for little children

And this makes the difference

Unfortunately this ideal doesn't exist in the world

and the difference between men and women in leadership positions

is too big

Gender inequity is the norm in the majority of professions

even in global health

I have learned that if we focus on women's education

we improve their life positively

as well as the wellbeing of their community

This is why now I dedicate my life to education

And this is totally aligned with my sense of equity

and my pursuit of social justice

because if you want to increase access to health services

you need first to increase access to health education

So with friends and partners we are building a beautiful university

in the rural north of Rwanda

We educate our students

to provide quality equitable holistic care

to everyone leaving no one out

focusing on the vulnerable especially women and children

who are historically the last to be served

We transform them into leaders

and give them managerial skills and advocacy skills

for them to be smooth changemakers

in the society where they will be

so that they can build health systems

that allow them to care about the vulnerable where they are

And it's really transformative

Because currently

medical education for example

is given in institutions based in cities

focused on quality health services and skills clinical skills

to be given in institutions

We also focus on quality clinical skills

but with biosocial approach to the condition of patient

for care to be given in communities where the people live

with hospitalization only when necessary

And also

after four to seven years of clinical education in cities

young graduates don't want to go back to rural area

So this is why we have built the University of Global Health Equity

an initiative of Partners in Health called UGHE
UGHE
in the rural north of Rwanda

Applause

Our students

are meant to go and change the world

They will come from all over  it's a global university 

and will get the medical education for free

at one condition

they have to serve the vulnerable across the world

during six to nine years

They will keep the salary for themselves and their families

but turn the education we give in quality clinical services

especially for the vulnerable

And doing so

they sign an agreement at the start that they will do that

a binding agreement

We don't want money

We have to go and mobilize the money

But they will turn this in quality service delivery for all

For this of course

we need a strong gender equity agenda

And in all our classes master's course

minimum of  percent of women

Applause

And I'm proud to say

that for the medical school that started five months ago

we have enrolled  percent girls

Applause

This is a statement against the current inequity

for women to access medical education in our continent

I believe in women's education

This is why I applaud African ladies who go all over the world

to increase their education their skills and their knowledge

But I hope they will bring that back to Africa

to build the continent

and make the continent a strong continent

because I'm sure

a stronger Africa will make the world stronger

Applause

Twentythree years ago

I went back to Rwanda

to a broken Rwanda

that now is still a poor country

but shining with a bright future

And I am full of joy to have come back

even if some days were very difficult

and even if some days I was depressed because I didn't find a solution

and people were dying

or things were not moving enough

But I'm so proud to have contributed to improve my community

And this makes me full of joy

So African women from the diaspora

if you hear me

never forget your homeland

And when you are ready come back home

I did so

It has fulfilled my life

So come back home

Thank you

Applause

I'm here to talk about climate change

but I'm not really an environmentalist

In fact I've never really thought of myself as a nature person

I have never gone camping never gone hiking

never even owned a pet

I've lived my whole life in cities

actually just one city

And while I like to take trips to visit nature

I always thought it was something that was happening elsewhere

far away

with all of modern life a fortress against its forces

In other words

like just about everybody I knew

I lived my life complacent

and deluded

about the threat from global warming

Which I took to be happening slowly

happening at a distance

and representing only a modest threat to the way that I lived

In each of these ways

I was very very wrong

Now most people if they were telling you about climate change

will tell you a story about the future

If I was doing that I would say

According to the UN if we don't change course

by the end of the century

we're likely to get about four degrees Celsius of warming

That would mean some scientists believe

twice as much war

half as much food

a global GDP possibly  percent smaller than it would be without climate change
GDPGDP
That's an impact that's deeper than the Great Depression

and it would be permanent

But the impacts are actually happening a lot faster than 

By just  it's estimated

many of the biggest cities in South Asia and the Middle East

will be almost literally unlivably hot in summer

These are cities that today are home to    million people

And in just three decades

you wouldn't be able to walk around outside in them

without risking heatstroke or possibly death

The planet is now  degrees Celsius warmer

than it was before industrialization

That may not sound like a lot

but it actually puts us entirely outside the window of temperatures

that enclose all of human history

That means that everything we have ever known as a species

the evolution of the human animal

the development of agriculture

the development of rudimentary civilization

and modern civilization and industrial civilization

everything we know about ourselves as biological creatures

as social creatures as political creatures

all of it is the result of climate conditions

we have already left behind

It's like we've landed on an entirely different planet

with an entirely different climate

And we now have to figure out

what of the civilization that we've brought with us

can endure these new conditions

and what can't

And things will get worse from here

Now for a very long time

we were told that climate change was a slow saga

It started with the industrial revolution

and it had fallen to us

to clean up the mess left by our grandparents

so our grandchildren wouldn't be dealing with the results

It was a story of centuries

In fact half of all of the emissions

that have ever been produced from the burning of fossil fuels

in the entire history of humanity

have been produced in just the last  years

That's since Al Gore published his first book on warming
Al Gore
It's since the UN established its IPCC climate change body
IPCC
We've done more damage since then

than in all the centuries all the millennia before

Now I'm  years old

which means my life contains this entire story

When I was born the planet's climate seemed stable

Today

we are on the brink of catastrophe

The climate crisis is not the legacy of our ancestors

It is the work of a single generation

Ours

This may all sound like bad news

Which it is really bad news

But it also contains I think

some good news at least relatively speaking

These impacts are terrifyingly large

But they are also I think exhilarating

Because they are ultimately a reflection

of how much power we have over the climate

If we get to those hellish scenarios

it will be because we have made them happen

because we have chosen to make them happen

Which means we can choose to make other scenarios happen too

Now that may seem too rosy to believe

and the political obstacles are in fact enormous

But it is a simple fact 

the main driver of global warming is human action

How much carbon we put into the atmosphere

Our hands are on those levers

And we can write the story of the planet's climate future ourselves

Not just can  but are

Since inaction is a kind of action

we'll be writing that story ourselves whether we like it or not

This is not just any story

all of us holding the future of the planet in our hands

It's the kind of story we used to recognize only in mythology

and theology

A single generation

that has brought the future of humanity into doubt

now tasked with securing a new future

So what would that look like

It could mean solar arrays barnacling the planet

really everywhere you looked

It could mean if we developed better technology

we wouldn't even need to deploy them that broadly

because it's been estimated that just a sliver of the Sahara desert

absorbs enough solar power to provide all the world's energy needs

But we'd probably need a new electric grid

one that doesn't lose twothirds of its power to waste heat

as is today the case in the US

We could use some more nuclear power perhaps

although it would have to be an entirely different kind of nuclear power

because today's technology simply isn't costcompetitive

with renewable energy whose costs are falling so rapidly

We'd need a new kind of plane

because I don't think it's particularly practical

to ask the entire world to give up on air travel

especially as so much of the global South

is for the very first time able to afford it

We need planes that won't produce carbon

We need a new kind of agriculture

Because we probably can't ask people to entirely give up on meat and go vegan

it would mean a new way of raising beef

Or perhaps an old way

since we already know that traditional pasturing practices

can turn cattle farms

from what are called carbon sources which produce CO

into carbon sinks which absorb them

If you prefer a techno solution
Techno
maybe we can grow some of that mean in the lab

Probably we could also feed some real cattle seaweed

because that cuts their methane emissions by as much as  or  percent

Probably we'd have to do all of these things

because as with every aspect of this puzzle

the problem is simply too vast and complicated

to solve in any single silverbullet way

And no matter how many solutions we deploy

we probably won't be able to decarbonize in time

That's the terrifying math that we face

We won't be able to beat climate change

only live with it and limit it

And that means we'd probably need

some amount of what are called negative emissions

which take carbon out of the atmosphere as well

Billions of new trees maybe trillions of new trees

And whole plantations of carboncapture machines

Perhaps an industry twice or four times the size

of today's oil and gas business

to undo the damage that was done by those businesses in past decades

We would need a new kind of infrastructure

poured by a different kind of cement

because today if cement were a country

it would be the world's third biggest emitter

And China is pouring as much cement every three years

as the US poured in the entire th century

We would need to build seawalls and levees

to protect those people living on the coast

many of whom are too poor to build them today

which is why it must mean an end to a narrowly nationalistic geopolitics
national
that allows us to define the suffering of those living elsewhere in the world

as insignificant

when we even acknowledge it

This better future won't be easy

But the only obstacles are human ones

That may not be much of a comfort

if you know what I know about human brutality and indifference

but I promise you it is better than the alternative

Science isn't stopping us from taking action

and neither is technology

We have the tools we need today to begin

Of course we also have the tools we need to end global poverty

epidemic disease

and the abuse of women as well

Which is why more than new tools we need a new politics

a way of overcoming all those human obstacles 

our culture our economics

our status quo bias

our disinterest in taking seriously anything that really scares us

Our shortsightedness

Our sense of selfinterest

And the selfishness of the world's rich and powerful

who have the least incentive to change anything

Now they will suffer too

but not as much as those with the least

who have done the least to produce warming

and have benefited the least

from the processes that have brought us to this crisis point

but will be burdened most in the decades ahead

A new politics

would make the matter of managing that burden

where it falls and how heavily

the top priority of our time

No matter what we do climate change will transform modern life

Some amount of warming is already baked in and is inevitable

which means probably some amount of additional suffering is too

And even if we take dramatic action

and avoid some of these truly terrifying worstcase scenarios

it would mean living on an entirely different planet

With a new politics a new economics

a new relationship to technology

Women are works of art

On the outside as on the inside

I am a neuroscientist and I focus on the inside

especially on women's brains

There are many theories on how women's brains differ

from men's brains

and I've been looking at brains for  years

and can guarantee that there is no such thing

as a gendered brain

Pink and blue Barbie and Lego

those are all inventions that have nothing to do

with the way our brains are built

That said women's brains differ from men's brains

in some respects

And I'm here to talk about these differences

because they actually matter for our health

For example

women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder

or depression

not to mention headaches and migraines

But also at the core of my research

women are more likely than men to have Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause

of dementia on the planet

affecting close to six million people in the United States alone

But almost two thirds of all those people

are actually women

So for every man suffering from Alzheimer's

there are two women

So why is that overall

Is it age

Is it lifespan

What else could it be

A few years ago

I launched the Women's Brain Initiative

at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City

exactly to answer those questions

And tonight I'm here with some answers

So it turns out our brains age differently

and menopause plays a key role here for women

Now most people think of the brain as a kind of black box

isolated from the rest of the body

But in reality our brains are in constant interaction

with the rest of us

And perhaps surprisingly

the interactions with the reproductive system

are crucial for brain aging in women

These interactions are mediated by our hormones

And we know that hormones differ between the genders

Men have more testosterone women have more estrogens

But what really matters here

is that these hormones differ in their longevity

Men's testosterone doesn't run out until late in life

which is a slow and pretty much symptomfree process of course

Laughter

Women's estrogens on the other hand

start fading in midlife during menopause

which is anything but symptomfree

We associate menopause with the ovaries

but when women say that they're having hot flashes

night sweats insomnia memory lapses depression anxiety

those symptoms don't start in the ovaries

They start in the brain

Those are neurological symptoms

We're just not used to thinking about them as such

So why is that

Why are our brains impacted by menopause

Well first of all

our brains and ovaries are part of the neuroendocrine system

As part of the system the brain talks to the ovaries

and the ovaries talk back to the brain

every day of our lives as women

So the health of the ovaries is linked to the health of the brain

And the other way around

At the same time

hormones like estrogen are not only involved in reproduction

but also in brain function

And estrogen in particular or estradiol

is really key for energy production in the brain

At the cellular level

estrogen literally pushes neurons to burn glucose to make energy

If your estrogen is high

your brain energy is high

When your estrogen declines though

your neurons start slowing down and age faster

And studies have shown that this process

can even lead to the formation of amyloid plaques

or Alzheimer's plaques

which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease

These effects are stronger in specific brain regions

starting with the hypothalamus

which is in charge of regulating body temperature

When estrogen doesn't activate the hypothalamus correctly

the brain cannot regulate body temperature correctly

So those hot flashes that women get

that's the hypothalamus

Then there's the brain stem in charge of sleep and wake

When estrogen doesn't activate the brain stem correctly

we have trouble sleeping

Or it's the amygdala

the emotional center of the brain close to the hippocampus

the memory center of the brain

When estrogen levels ebb in these regions

we start getting mood swings perhaps

and forget things

So this is the brain anatomy of menopause if you will

But let me show you

what an actual woman's brain can look like

So this is a kind of brain scan

called positron emission tomography or PET
PET
It looks at brain energy levels

And this is what you want your brain to look like

when you're in your s

Really nice and bright

Now this brain belongs to a woman who was  years old

when she was first scanned before menopause

And this is the same brain just eight years later

after menopause

If we put them side by side

I think you can easily see how the bright yellow

turned orange almost purple

That's a  percent drop in brain energy levels

Now in general

this just doesn't seem to happen to a man of the same age

In our studies with hundreds of people

we show that middleaged men usually have high brain energy levels

For women brain energy is usually fine before menopause

but then it gradually declines during the transition

And this was found independent of age

It didn't matter if the women were   or 

What mattered most was that they were in menopause

So of course we need more research to confirm this

but it looks like women's brains in midlife

are more sensitive to hormonal aging

than just straight up chronological aging

And this is important information to have

because so many women can feel these changes

So many of our patients have said to me

that they feel like their minds are playing tricks on them

to put it mildly

So I really want to validate this because it's real

And so just to clarify if this is you

you are not crazy

Laughter

Applause

Thank you

It's important

So many women have worried that they might be losing their minds

But the truth is that your brain might be going through a transition

or is going through a transition

and needs time and support to adjust

Also if anyone is concerned

that middleaged women might be underperformers

I'll just quickly add that we looked at cognitive performance

God forbid right

Laughter

Let's not do that

But we looked at cognitive performance

and we found absolutely no differences between men and women

before and after menopause

And other studies confirm this

So basically we may be tired

but we are just as sharp

Laughter

Get that out of the way

That all said

there is something else more serious that deserves our attention

If you remember

I mentioned that estrogen declines could potentially promote

the formation of amyloid plaques or Alzheimer's plaques

But there's another kind of brain scan that looks exactly at those plaques

And we used it to show that middleaged men hardly have any

which is great

But for women

there's quite a bit of an increase during the transition to menopause

And I want to be really really clear here

that not all women develop the plaques

and not all women with the plaques develop dementia

Having the plaques is a risk factor

it is not in any way a diagnosis especially at this stage

But still it's quite an insight

to associate Alzheimer's with menopause

We think of menopause as belonging to middle age

and Alzheimer's as belonging to old age

But in reality

many studies including my own work

had shown that Alzheimer's disease starts with negative changes in the brain

years if not decades prior to clinical symptoms

So for women

it looks like this process starts in midlife

during menopause

Which is important information to have

because it gives us a time line to start looking for those changes

So in terms of a time line

most women go through menopause in their early s

But it can be earlier

often because of medical interventions

And the common example is a hysterectomy andor an oophorectomy

which is the surgical removal of the uterus

andor the ovaries

And unfortunately there is evidence

that having the uterus and more so the ovaries removed

prior to menopause

correlates with the higher risk of dementia in women

And I know that this is upsetting news

and it's definitely depressing news

but we need to talk about it

because most women are not aware of this correlation

and it seems like very important information to have

Also no one is suggesting that women decline these procedures

if they need them

The point here is that we really need to better understand

what happens to our brains as we go through menopause

natural or medical

and how to protect our brains in the process

So how do we do that

How do we protect our brains

Should we take hormones

That's a fair question it's a good question

And the shortest possible answer right now

is that hormonal therapy can be helpful

to alleviate a number of symptoms like hot flashes

but it's not currently recommended for dementia prevention

And many of us are working on testing different formulations

and different dosages and different time lines

and hopefully all this work will lead to a change in recommendations

in the future

Meanwhile there are other things that we can do today

to support our hormones and their effects on the brain

that do not require medications

but do require taking a good look at our lifestyle

That's because the foods we eat

how much exercise we get

how much sleep we get or don't get

how much stress we have in our lives

those are all things that can actually impact our hormones 

for better and for worse

Food for example

There are many diets out there

but studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular

is supportive of women's health

Women on this diet have a much lower risk

of cognitive decline of depression

of heart disease of stroke and of cancer

and they also have fewer hot flashes

What's interesting about this diet

is that it's quite rich in foods that contain estrogens

in the form of phytoestrogens or estrogens from plants

that act like mild estrogens in our bodies

Some phytoestrogens have been linked to a possible risk of cancer

but not the ones in this diet which are safe

Especially from flax seeds

sesame seeds dried apricots

legumes and a number of fruits

And for some good news

dark chocolate contains phytoestrogens too

So diet is one way to gain estrogens

but it's just as important to avoid things that suppress our estrogens instead

especially stress

Stress can literally steal your estrogens

and that's because cortisol which is the main stress hormone

works in balance with our estrogens

So if cortisol goes up your estrogens go down

If cortisol goes down your estrogens go back up

So reducing stress is really important

It doesn't just help your day

it also helps your brain

So these are just a few things

that we can do to support our brains

and there are more

But the important thing here

is that changing the way we understand the female brain

really changes the way that we care for it

and the way that we frame women's health

And the more women demand this information

the sooner we'll be able to break the taboos around menopause

and also come up with solutions that actually work

not just for Alzheimer's disease

but for women's brain health as a whole

Brain health is women's health

Thank you

Applause

Thank you

Oh thank you

I'm here because I've spent far too many nights lying awake

worrying and wondering who wins in the end

Is it humans or is it robots

You see as a technology strategist

my job involves behavior change

understanding why and how people adopt new technologies

And that means I'm really frustrated

that I know I won't live to see how this all ends up

And in fact if the youngest person watching this is 

and the oldest a robust 

then together

our collective consciousnesses span just  years

That is a myopic pinprick of time

when you think of the evolution and the story of life on this planet

Turns out we're all in the cheap seats

and none of us will live to see how it all pans out

So at my company we wanted a way around this

We wanted to see if there was a way to cantilever out

beyond our fixed temporal vantage point

to get a sense of how it all shakes up

And to do this we conducted a study amongst  Americans

representative of the US census

in which we asked a battery of attitudinal questions

around robotics and AI
AI
and also captured behavioral ones around technology adoption

We had a big study

so that we could analyze differences in gender and generations

between religious and political beliefs

even job function and personality trait

It is a fascinating timebound time capsule

of our human frailty

in this predawn of the robotic era

And I have five minutes to tell you about it

The first thing you should know is that we brainstormed

a list of scenarios of current and potential AI robotics
AI
They ran the spectrum from the mundane

so a robot house cleaner anyone

Through to the mischievous

the idea of a robot pet sitter or maybe a robot lawyer

or maybe a sex partner

Through to the downright macabre the idea of being a cyborg

blending human and robot

or uploading your brain so it could live on after your death

And we plotted people's comfort levels with these various scenarios

There were actually  in the study

but for ease I'm going to show you just a few of them here

The first thing you'll notice of course is the sea of red

America is very uncomfortable with this stuff

That's why we call it the discomfort index

not the comfort index

There were only two things the majority of America is OK with

And that's the idea of a robot AI house cleaner
AI
and a robot AI package deliverer
AI
so Dyson and Amazon you guys should talk

There's an opportunity there

It seems we're ready to offload our chores to our robot friends

We're kind of definitely on the fence when it comes to services

so robot AI lawyer or a financial adviser maybe
AI
But we're firmly closed to the idea of robot care

whether it be a nurse a doctor child care

So from this you'd go

It's OK Lucy you know what

Go back to sleep stop worrying the humans win in the end

But actually not so fast

If you look at my data very closely

you can see we're more vulnerable than we think

AI has a branding problem

So of those folks who said

that they would absolutely reject the idea of a personal assistant

 percent of them had in fact one in their pockets

in terms of a device with Alexa Google or Siri
AlexaGoogleSiri
One in five of those who were against the idea of AI matchmaking

had of course you guessed it done online dating

And  percent of those of us who refuse the idea

of boarding an autonomous plane with a pilot backup

had in fact just like me to get here to Vancouver

flown commercial

Lest you think everybody was scared though

here are the marvelous folk in the middle

These are the neutrals

These are people for whom you say

OK robot friend

and they're like Hm robot friend Maybe
 
Or AI pet
 AI
and they go Never say never

And as any decent political operative knows

flipping the ambivalent middle can change the game

Another reason I know we're vulnerable is men 

I'm sorry but men you are twice as likely than women

to believe that getting into an autonomous car is a good idea

that uploading your brain for posterity is fun

and two and a half times more likely to believe that becoming a cyborg is cool

and for this I blame Hollywood

Laughter

And this is where I want you to look around the theater

and know that one in four men are OK with the idea of sex with a robot

That goes up to  percent of millennial men

compared to just one in  women

which I think puts a whole new twist on the complaint of mechanical sex

Laughter

Even more astounding than that though to be honest

is this behavioral difference

So here we have people who have a device with a voice assistant in it

so a smart speaker a home hub or a smart phone

versus those who don't

And you can see from this graph

that the Trojan horse is already in our living room

And as these devices proliferate

and our collective defenses soften

we all see how it can end

In fact this may be as good a time as any to admit

I did take my Alexa Dot on vacation with me

Final finding I have time for is generational

So look at the difference just three generations make

This is the leap from silent to boomer to millennial

And what's more fascinating than this is if you extrapolate this out

the same rate of change

just the same pace

not the accelerated one I actually believe will be the case

the same pace

then it is eight generations away

when we hear every single American

thinking the majority of these things here are normal

So the year  is an astounding place

where everything here is mainstream

And lest you needed any more convincing

here is the generation's excitement level with AI

So not surprisingly the youngest of us are more excited

But and possibly the most paradoxical finding of my career

when I asked these people my am question

Who wins in the end

Guess what

The more excited you are about AI and robotics
AI
the more likely you are to say it's the robots

And I don't think we need a neural net running patternrecognition software

to see where this is all headed

We are the proverbial frogs in boiling water

So if the robots at TED are watching this for posterity
TED
could you send a cyborg dig me up and tell me if I was right

Laughter

Thank you

Menstruation

A simple word describing a natural biological process

weighed down by centuries of stigma

has been transformed into something most of us can only speak about

in whispers

But why

As I speak to you right now

more than  million women around the world

are having a period

None of us would exist without it

and yet it remains an embarrassing subject to broach

From my experience and that of the women around me

I can tell you that it's exhausting

It's exhausting to carefully take out a brown paper bag hiding a pad

stuffing it into your pocket in the middle of a class

and rushing to the washroom as discreetly as possible

It's exhausting to sit through lessons and meetings

pretending to be absolutely normal

while internally crying out from intense period cramps

It's exhausting to be dismissively told that youre PMSing
PMSing
or suffering from that time of the month

and it's exhausting to continuously fight back against ageold traditions

that ask you not to pray

visit temples cook touch pickle and the list goes on and on

while you're just trying to bleed and be left in peace

Laughter

But you know what the worst part is

The worst part is that the things that seem tiring to us

are merely the tip of the iceberg

because we in this room are privileged enough

to be able to afford sanitary napkins every month

to be able to visit a gynecologist in case of any problem

to be able to tell what's normal and abnormal with our monthly cycle

We have access to water sanitation and toilets

that help us maintain our privacy and hygiene

But what about those who don't

What about  million girls around the world

who go to school without even having access to water and soap

to wash their hands

What about yearold schoolgirls in Kenya

who have to sell their bodies to be able to buy sanitary napkins

What about twothirds of rural high school girls in India

who don't even understand what their bodies are going through

at menarche

And right now we are all gathered here in the USA

So what about  percent of women in St Louis Missouri

who weren't able to afford menstrual hygiene supplies

in the previous year

What about the struggles of homeless transgender

intersex and displaced people

who menstruate

What about them

The scale of the problem

stemming in part from the deeprooted stigma attached to menstruation

is unimaginable

And the desire to voice this frustration

led me along with three other teammates

to initiate a campaign that calls for change

questions the taboos surrounding menstruation

and spreads period positivity

The name of our campaign Pravahkriti
 Pravahkriti
was born from the message that we want to convey to the world

Pravah means flow
 Pravah
and kriti means a beautiful creation
 kriti
Because how could the monthly cycle that ultimately gives rise to all creation

be anything less than beautiful

Now as a social issue menstruation has several facets to it

that overlap reinforce and worsen the situation

So we based our campaign on four fundamental pillars

health hygiene awareness and spreading positivity

But how did we actually implement this

Well we started within the walls of our school classroom

Instead of simply explaining menstruation to children

from a textbook or biological standpoint

we adopted an innovative approach

We conducted an activity where students strung together a bracelet

consisting of  beads signifying the length of the menstrual cycle

out of which four to seven beads were of a different color

demonstrating the days a woman bleeds

And in this way we not only explained what periods are

in a manner that was educational

but also approachable and engaging

To offer another example

we explored various ways of alleviating cramps

including preparing some natural remedies in school itself

And we didn't just stop at involving girls in our campaign

In fact boys were equally involved

and one of our coteam members

as you saw

is also a boy

Through internal conversations

where girls could freely share their personal experiences

and boys could just ask questions no matter how dumb they might seem

our male volunteers quickly got over their awkwardness

not just supporting but also leading educational sessions

Clearly starting an inclusive conversation

including members of all genders

and listening to and supporting each other

can go a long way

Now to make our campaign successful we conducted extensive research

interviewed gynecologists

surveyed people to gauge public opinion on periods

and conducted a panel discussion with professionals working in this field

And then we undertook the journey to create change

We organized a stall at Shilpotsav a local fair
Shilpotsav
where we distributed sanitary napkinshaped envelopes

and bookmarks containing periodpositive messages

We donated hundreds of pads that we had collected

through a pad donation drive at school

Interacting with young girls in government and charitable schools

we explained periods to them through a game of hopscotch

and distributed period kits that we had made ourselves

that consisted of a pad and other items like a paper soap

and sanitizer for maintaining hygiene

a piece of dark chocolate just to lift their mood

a sachet of ginger tea and so on

In whatever we did we strived to think beyond the norm and break barriers

be it by creating a physical period tracker

to help girls without access to the internet

to record their monthly cycle

or sensitizing the masses by performing street plays

or even developing a video game called Crimson Crusade 

Laughter

that introduces both boys and girls

to problems faced by menstruating women globally

and players progress in the game

by defeating menstrual monsters

Laughter

To sustain this effort

we've installed  sanitary napkin dispensers in several schools

Gradually people's mindsets are changing

But does change come so easily

At a school for the underprivileged

we encountered a girl who had just got her first period

but wasn't wearing anything to absorb the flow

Imagine being her

sitting in class feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable

looking down and seeing red

asking your parents for help asking what was going on with you

and being dismissed

Imagine the shame fear and embarrassment for being caught doing something wrong

that forces you into living in ignorance and silence

at the cost of your health and dignity

While we do our part our endeavors will only be successful

if each one of you internalizes and spreads onward

the idea that menstruation is completely normal

if each one of you conveys this message to every person you know

When we can discuss digestion blood circulation and respiration 

all natural biological processes 

why should menstruation be offlimits

And you too can help make it less taboo

simply by being more open with male friends and family members

supporting local and international organizations

working to improve menstrual hygiene management

making menstrual bracelets with middle school kids in your area

or even by playing Crimson Crusade with your friends

Every small steps counts because brushing this topic under the carpet

perpetuates lack of access to sanitary absorbents

ignorance of menstrual health issues

school absenteeism infection and so much more

I'd like to end with a few lines a volunteer wrote for us

Let the crimson tide turn

Let there be waves of positivity

thundering applause

villages full of women who bleed with pride

Let there be a scent of education

drifting through the oxygen inhaled by men women and children

Let all know the marvels of menstruation

and celebrate Pravahkriti
Pravahkriti
Thank you

Transcriber Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez
Joseph Geni
Can you hear me OK

Audience Yes

Jim Hudspeth OK Well if you can it's really amazing
 
because my voice is changing the air pressure where you sit

by just a few billionths of the atmospheric level

yet we take it for granted

that your ears can capture that infinitesimal signal

and use it to signal to the brain the full range of auditory experiences

the human voice music the natural world

How does your ear do that

And the answer to that is

through the cells that are the real hero of this presentation 

the ear's sensory receptors

which are called hair cells

Now these hair cells are unfortunately named

because they have nothing at all to do with the kind of hair

of which I have less and less

These cells were originally named that by early microscopists

who noticed that emanating from one end of the cell

was a little cluster of bristles

With modern electron microscopy we can see much better

the nature of the special feature that gives the hair cell its name

That's the hair bundle

It's this cluster of  to several hundred fine cylindrical rods

that stand upright at the top end of the cell

And this apparatus is what is responsible for your hearing me right this instant

Now I must say that I am somewhat in love with these cells

I've spent  years in their company 

Laughter

and part of the reason is that they're really beautiful

There's an aesthetic component to it

Here for example are the cells

with which an ordinary chicken conducts its hearing

These are the cells that a bat uses for its sonar

We use these large hair cells from a frog for many of our experiments

Hair cells are found all the way down to the most primitive of fishes

and those of reptiles often have this really beautiful

almost crystalline order

But above and beyond its beauty

the hair bundle is an antenna

It's a machine for converting sound vibrations into electrical responses

that the brain can then interpret

At the top of each hair bundle as you can see in this image

there's a fine filament connecting each of the little hairs

the stereocilia

It's here marked with a little red triangle

And this filament has at its base a couple of ion channels

which are proteins that span the membrane

And here's how it works

This rat trap represents an ion channel

It has a pore that passes potassium ions and calcium ions

It has a little molecular gate that can be open or it can be closed

And its status is set by this elastic band which represents that protein filament

Now imagine that this arm represents one stereocilium

and this arm represents the adjacent shorter one

with the elastic band between them

When sound energy impinges upon the hair bundle

it pushes it in the direction towards its taller edge

The sliding of the stereocilia puts tension in the link

until the channels open and ions rush into the cell

When the hair bundle is pushed in the opposite direction

the channels close

And most importantly

a backandforth motion of the hair bundle

as ensues during the application of acoustic waves

alternately opens and closes the channel

and each opening admits millions and millions of ions into the cell

Those ions constitute an electrical current

that excites the cell

The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber

and then propagates into the brain

Notice that the intensity of the sound

is represented by the magnitude of this response

A louder sound pushes the hair bundle farther

opens the channel longer

lets more ions in

and gives rise to a bigger response

Now this mode of operation has the advantage of great speed

Some of our senses such as vision

use chemical reactions that take time

And as a consequence of that

if I show you a series of pictures at intervals of  or  per second

you get the sense of a continuous image

Because it doesn't use reactions

the hair cell is fully  times faster than our other senses

We can hear sounds at frequencies as great as  cycles per second

and some animals have ever faster ears

The ears of bats and whales for example can respond to their sonar pulses

at  cycles a second

But this speed doesn't entirely explain why the ear performs so well

And it turns out that our hearing benefits from an amplifier

something called the active process

The active process enhances our hearing

and makes possible all the remarkable features that I've already mentioned

Let me tell you how it works

First of all the active process amplifies sound

so you can hear at threshold sounds that move the hair bundle

by a distance of only about threetenths of a nanometer

That's the diameter of one water molecule

It's really astonishing

The system can also operate

over an enormously wide dynamic range

Why do we need this amplification

The amplification in ancient times was useful

because it was valuable for us to hear the tiger before the tiger could hear us

And these days it's essential as a distant early warning system

It's valuable to be able to hear fire alarms

or contemporary dangerous such as speeding fire engines or police cars or the like

When the amplification fails our hearing's sensitivity plummets

and an individual may then need an electronic hearing aid

to supplant the damaged biological one

This active process also enhances our frequency selectivity

Even an untrained individual can distinguish two tones

that differ by only twotenths of a percent

which is onethirtieth of the difference between two piano notes

and a trained musician can do even better

This fine discrimination is useful

in our ability to distinguish different voices

and to understand the nuances of speech

And again if the active process deteriorates

it becomes harder to carry out verbal communication

Finally the active process is valuable in setting the very broad range

of sound intensities that our ears can tolerate

from the very faintest sound that you can hear such as a dropped pen

to the loudest sound that you can stand 

say a jackhammer or a jet plane

The amplitude of sounds spans a range of one millionfold

which is more than is encompassed by any other sense

or by any manmade device of which I'm aware

And again if this system deteriorates

an affected individual may have a hard time

hearing the very faintest sounds

or tolerating the very loudest ones

Now to understand how the hair cell does its thing

one has to situate it within its environment within the ear

We learn in school that the organ of hearing

is the coiled snailshaped cochlea

It's an organ about the size of a chickpea

It's embedded in the bone on either side of the skull

We also learn that an optical prism

can separate white light into its constituent frequencies

which we see as distinct colors

In an analogous way

the cochlea acts as sort of an acoustic prism

that splits apart complex sounds into their component frequencies

So when a piano is sounded

different notes blend together into a chord

The cochlea undoes that process

It separates them and represents each at a different position

In this picture you can see where three notes 

middle C and the two extreme notes on a piano 
C
are represented in the cochlea

The lowest frequencies go all the way up to the top of the cochlea

The highest frequencies down to  Hz
 Hz
go all the way to the bottom of the cochlea

and every other frequency is represented somewhere in between

And as this diagram shows

successive musical tones are represented a few tens of hair cells apart

along the cochlear surface

Now this separation of frequencies

is really key in our ability to identify different sounds

because very musical instrument

every voice

emits a distinct constellation of tones

The cochlea separates those frequencies

and the  hair cells then report to the brain

how much of each frequency is present

The brain can then compare all the nerve signals

and decide what particular tone is being heard

But this doesn't explain everything that I want to explain

Where's the magic

I told you already about the great things that the hair cell can do

How does it carry out the active process

and do all the remarkable features that I mentioned at the outset

The answer is instability

We used to think that the hair bundle was a passive object

it just sat there except when it was stimulated

But in fact it's an active machine

It's constantly using internal energy to do mechanical work

and enhance our hearing

So even at rest in the absence of any input

an active hair bundle is constantly trembling

It's constantly twitching back and forth

But when even a weak sound is applied to it

it latches on to that sound and begins to move very neatly

in a onetoone way with it

and by so doing it amplifies the signal about a thousand times

This same instability also enhances our frequency selectivity

for a given hair cell tends to oscillate best

at the frequency at which it normally trembles

when it's not being stimulated

So this apparatus not only gives us our remarkably acute hearing

but also gives us the very sharp tuning

I want to offer you a short demonstration

of something related to this

I'll ask the people who are running the sound system

to turn up its sensitivity at one specific frequency

So just as a hair cell is tuned to one frequency

the amplifier will now enhance a particular frequency in my voice

Notice how specific tones emerge more clearly from the background

This is exactly what hair cells do

Each hair cell amplifies and reports one specific frequency

and ignores all the others

And the whole set of hair cells as a group can then report to the brain

exactly what frequencies are present in a given sound

and the brain can determine what melody is being heard

or what speech is being intended

Now an amplifier such as the public address system

can also cause problems

If the amplification is turned up too far

it goes unstable and begins to howl

or emit sounds

And one wonders why the active process doesn't do the same thing

Why don't our ears beam out sounds

And the answer is that they do

In a suitably quiet environment  percent of normal people

will have one or more sounds coming out of their ears

Laughter

I'll give you an example of this

You will hear two emissions at high frequencies

coming from a normal human ear

You may also be able to discern background noise

like the microphone's hiss

the gurgling of a stomach the heartbeat the rustling of clothes
g
Hums microphone hiss dampened taps clothes rustling

This is typical

Most ears emit just a handful of tones

but some can emit as many as 

Every ear is unique so my right ear is different from my left

my ear is different from your ear

but unless an ear is damaged

it continues to emit the same spectrum of frequencies

over a period of years or even decades

So what's going on

It turns out that the ear can control its own sensitivity

its own amplification

So if you're in a very loud environment like a sporting event

or a musical concert

you don't need any amplification

and the system is turned down all the way

If you are in a room like this auditorium

you might have a little bit of amplification

but of course the public address system does most of the work for you

And finally if you go into a really quiet room

where you can hear a pin drop

the system is turned up almost all the way

But if you go into an ultraquiet room such as a sound chamber

the system turns itself up to 

it goes unstable

and it begins to emit sound

And these emissions constitute a really strong demonstration

of just how active the hair cell can be

So in the last minute I want to turn to another question that might come up

which is Where do we go from here

And I would say that there are three issues

that I would really like to address in the future

The first is What is the molecular motor

that's responsible for the hair cell's amplification

Somehow nature has stumbled across a system

that can oscillate or amplify at  cycles per second

or even more

That's much faster than any other biological oscillation

and we would like to understand where it comes from

The second issue is how the hair cell's amplification is adjusted

to deal with the acoustic circumstances

Who turns the knob to increase or decrease the amplification

in a quiet or in a loud environment

And the third issue is one that concerns all of us

which is what we can do about the deterioration of our hearing

Thirty million Americans

and more than  million people worldwide

have significant problems on a daily basis

with understanding speech in a noisy environment

or over the telephone

Many have even worse deficits

Moreover these deficits tend to get worse with time

because when human hair cells die

they're not replaced by cell division

But we know that nonmammalian animals can replace their cells

and those creatures' cells are dying and being replaced throughout life

so the animals maintain normal hearing

Here's an example from a little zebra fish

The cell at the top will undergo a division

to produce two new hair cells

They dance for a little bit

and then settle down and go to work

So we believe that if we can decode the molecular signals that are used

by these other animals to regenerate their hair cells

we'll be able to do the same thing for humans

And our group and many other groups are now engaged in research

trying to resurrect these amazing hair cells

Thank you for your attention

Ivana KoromKrystian Aparta
The minute she said it

the temperature in my classroom dropped

My students are usually laserfocused on me

but they shifted in their seats and looked away

I'm a black woman

who teaches the histories of race and US slavery

I'm aware that my social identity is always on display

And my students are vulnerable too

so I'm careful

I try to anticipate what part of my lesson might go wrong

But honestly

I didn't even see this one coming

None of my years of graduate school prepared me for what to do

when the Nword entered my classroom
N
I was in my first year of teaching

when the student said the Nword in my class
N
She was not calling anyone a name

She was brighteyed and bushytailed

She came to class with her readings done

she sat in the front row

and she was always on my team

When she said it

she was actually making a point about my lecture

by quoting a line from a s movie a comedy

that had two racist slurs

One for people of Chinese descent

and the other the Nword
N
As soon as she said it I held up my hands said Whoa whoa

But she assured me

It's a joke from 'Blazing Saddles'
''
and then she repeated it

This all happened  years ago

and how I handled it haunted me for a long time

It wasn't the first time I thought about the word

in an academic setting

I'm a professor of US history

it's in a lot of the documents that I teach

So I had to make a choice

After consulting with someone I trusted

I decided to never say it

Not even to quote it

But instead to use the euphemistic phrase the Nword
 N
Even this decision was complicated

I didn't have tenure yet

and I worried that senior colleagues

would think that by using the phrase I wasn't a serious scholar

But saying the actual word still felt worse

The incident in my classroom forced me to publicly reckon with the word

The history the violence

but also 
  
The history the violence but also any time it was hurled at me

spoken casually in front of me

any time it rested on the tip of someone's tongue

it all came flooding up in that moment

right in front of my students

And I had no idea what to do

So I've come to call stories like mine points of encounter

A point of encounter describes the moment you came facetoface with the Nword
N
If you've even been stumped or provoked by the word

whether as the result of an awkward social situation

an uncomfortable academic conversation

something you heard in pop culture

or if you've been called the slur

or witnessed someone getting called the slur

you have experienced a point of encounter

And depending on who you are and how that moment goes down

you might have a range of responses

Could throw you off a little bit

or it could be incredibly painful and humiliating

I've had lots of these points of encounter in my life

but one thing is true

There's not a lot of space to talk about them

That day in my classroom was pretty much like all of those times

I had an uninvited runin with the Nword
N
I froze

Because the Nword is hard to talk about
N
Part of the reason the Nword is so hard to talk about
N
it's usually only discussed in one way

as a figure of speech we hear this all the time right

It's just a word

The burning question that cycles through social media

is who can and cannot say it

Black intellectual TaNehisi Coates does a groundbreaking job
TaNehisi Coates
of defending the African American use of the word

On the other hand Wendy Kaminer
Wendy Kaminer
a white freedom of speech advocate

argues that if we don't all just come and say it

we give the word power

And a lot of people feel that way

The Pew Center recently entered the debate

In a survey called Race in America 

researchers asked US adults if they thought is was OK

for a white person to say the Nword
N
Seventy percent of all adults surveyed said never

And these debates are important

But they really obscure something else

They keep us from getting underneath to the real conversation

Which is that the Nword is not just a word
N
It's not neatly contained in a racist past

a relic of slavery

Fundamentally the Nword is an idea disguised as a word
N
that black people are intellectually

biologically

and immutably inferior to white people

And  and I think this is the most important part 

that that inferiority means that the injustice we suffer

and inequality we endure

is essentially our own fault

So yes it is 

Speaking of the word only as racist spew

or as an obscenity in hip hop music
ob
makes it sounds as if it's a disease

located in the American vocal cords

that can be snipped right out

It's not and it can't

And I learned this from talking to my students

So next time class met

I apologized

and I made an announcement

I would have a new policy

Students would see the word in my PowerPoints
PowerPoint
in film in essays they read

but we would never ever say the word out loud in class

Nobody ever said it again

But they didn't learn much either

Afterwards what bothered me most

was that I didn't even explain to students

why of all the vile problematic words in American English

why this particular word had its own buffer

the surrogate phrase the Nword
 N
Most of my students

many of them born in the late s and afterwards

didn't even know that the phrase the Nword
 N
is a relatively new invention in American English

When I was growing up it didn't exist

But in the late s

black college students writers intellectuals

more and more started to talk about racist attacks against them

But increasingly when they told these stories

they stopped using the word

Instead they reduced it to the initial N
N
and called it the Nword
 N
They felt that every time the word was uttered

it opened up old wounds so they refused to say it

They knew their listeners would hear the actual word in their heads

That wasn't the point

The point was they didn't want to put the word in their own mouths

or into the air

By doing this

they made an entire nation start to secondguess themselves

about saying it

This was such a radical move

that people are still mad about it

Critics accuse those of us who use the phrase the Nword
 N
or people who become outraged

you know just because the word is said

of being overprincipled

politically correct

or as I just read a couple of weeks ago in The New York Times

insufferably woke

Right

So I bought into this a little bit too

which is why the next time I taught the course

I proposed a freedom of speech debate

The Nword in academic spaces for or against
N
I was certain students would be eager

to debate who gets to say it and who doesn't

But they weren't

Instead 

my students started confessing

A white student from New Jersey talked about standing by

as a black kid at her school got bullied by this word

She did nothing and years later still carried the guilt

Another from Connecticut

talked about the pain of severing

a very close relationship with a family member

because that family member refused to stop saying the word

One of the most memorable stories came from a very quiet black student

from South Carolina

She didn't understand all the fuss

She said everyone at her school said the word

She wasn't talking about kids calling each other names in the hall

She explained that at her school

when teachers and administrators

became frustrated with an African American student

they called that student the actual Nword
N
She said it didn't bother her at all

But then a couple of days later

she came to visit me in my office hours and wept

She thought she was immune

She realized that she wasn't

Over the last  years

I have literally heard hundreds of these stories

from all kinds of people from all ages

People in their s remembering stories from the second grade

and when they were six

either calling people the word or being called the word

but carrying that all these years around this word you know

And as I listened to people talk about their points of encounter

the pattern that emerged for me as a teacher that I found most upsetting

is the single most fraught site

for these points of encounter

is the classroom

Most US kids are going to meet the Nword in class
N
One of the most assigned books in US high schools

is Mark Twains The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn

in which the word appears over  times

And this isn't an indictment of Huck Finn

The word is in lots of US literature and history

It's all over African American literature

Yet I hear from students

that when the word is said during a lesson

without discussion and context

it poisons the entire classroom environment

The trust between student and teacher is broken

Even so many teachers

often with the very best of intentions

still say the Nword in class
N
They want to show and emphasize the horrors of US racism

so they rely on it for shock value

Invoking it brings into stark relief

the ugliness of our nation's past

But they forget

the ideas are alive and well in our cultural fabric

The sixletter word is like a capsule of accumulated hurt

Every time it is said every time

it releases into the atmosphere the hateful notion

that black people are less

My black students tell me

that when the word is quoted or spoken in class

they feel like a giant spotlight is shining on them

One of my students told me

that his classmates were like bobbleheads

turning to gauge his reaction

A white student told me that in the eighth grade

when they were learning To Kill a Mockingbird

and reading it out loud in class

the student was stressed out

at the idea of having to read the word

which the teacher insisted all students do

that the student ended up spending most of the unit

hiding out in the bathroom

This is serious

Students across the country

talk about switching majors and dropping classes

because of poor teaching around the Nword
N
The issue of faculty carelessly speaking the word

has reached such a fevered pitch

it's led to protests at Princeton Emory

The New School

Smith College where I teach

and Williams College

where just recently students have boycotted the entire English Department

over it and other issues

And these were just the cases that make the news

This is a crisis

And while student reaction

looks like an attack on freedom of speech

I promise this is an issue of teaching

My students are not afraid of materials that have the Nword in it
N
They want to learn about James Baldwin

and William Faulkner

and about the civil rights movement

In fact their stories show

that this word is a central feature of their lives as young people

in the United States

It's in the music they love

And in the popular culture they emulate

the comedy they watch

it's in TV and movies

and memorialized in museums

They hear it in locker rooms

on Instagram
Instagram
in the hallways at school

in the chat rooms of the video games they play

It is all over the world they navigate

But they don't know how to think about it

or even really what the word means

I didn't even really understand what the word meant

until I did some research

I was astonished to learn

that black people first incorporated the Nword into the vocabulary
N
as political protest

not in the s or s

but as far back as the s

And I wish I had more time to talk

about the long subversive history of the black use of the Nword
N
But I will say this

Many times my students will come up to me and say

I understand the virulent roots of this word it's slavery

They are only partially right

This word which existed before it became a slur

but it becomes a slur at a very distinct moment in US history

and that's as large numbers of black people begin to become free

starting in the North in the s

In other words

this word is fundamentally an assault on black freedom

black mobility

and black aspiration

Even now

nothing so swiftly unleashes an Nword tirade
N
as a black person asserting their rights

or going where they please or prospering

Think of the attacks on Colin Kaepernick when he kneeled

Or Barack Obama when he became president
Barack Obama
My students want to know this history

But when they ask questions they're shushed and shamed

By shying away from talking about the Nword
N
we have turned this word into the ultimate taboo

crafting it into something so tantalizing

that for all US kids

no matter their racial background

part of their coming of age is figuring out

how to negotiate this word

We treat conversations about it like sex before sex education

We're squeamish we silence them

So they learn about it from misinformed friends and in whispers

I wish I could go back to the classroom that day

and push through my fear

to talk about the fact that something actually happened

Not just to me or to my black students

But to all of us

You know I think

we're all connected by our inability to talk about this word

But what if we explored our points of encounter

and did start to talk about it

Today I try to create the conditions in my classroom

to have open and honest conversations about it

One of those conditions  not saying the word

We're able to talk about it

because it doesn't come into the classroom

Another important condition

is I don't make my black students responsible

for teaching their classmates about this

That is my job

So I come prepared

I hold the conversation with a tight rein

and I'm armed with knowledge of the history

I always ask students the same question

Why is talking about the Nword hard
N
Their answers are amazing

They're amazing

More than anything though

I have become deeply acquainted with my own points of encounter

my personal history around this word

Because when the Nword comes to school
N
or really anywhere

it brings with it all of the complicated history of US racism

The nation's history

and my own

right here right now

There's no avoiding it

Applause

This is the sound of orcas off the coast of Vancouver

Whale chirps and squeaks

They make these fantastic sounds not just to communicate

but also sometimes to echolocate

to find their way around and to find food

But that can be tricky sometimes

because well here is the sound of a ship passing by

recorded underwater

Screeching oscillating sound

You know when we think about marine pollution

I think we usually think about plastics

Maybe toxic chemicals

or even ocean acidification from climate change

As a science journalist who often writes about environmental issues

those are the things that have passed my desk

over the past  years or so

But as I recently realized

when I was writing a feature for the science journal Nature

noise is another important kind of pollution

One that often gets ignored

You know maybe you've heard of the darkskies movement

which aimed to raise awareness of the issue of light pollution

and create pockets of unilluminated night

so that people and animals

could enjoy more natural cycles of light and dark night and day

Well in much the same way

there are people now raising awareness

of the issue of noise pollution

and trying to create pockets of quiet in the ocean

so that marine life can enjoy a more natural soundscape

This is important

Noise isn't just an irritation

It can cause chronic stress

or even physical injury

It can affect marine life's ability to find food and mates

and to listen out for predators and more

Think of all the sounds we inject into the ocean

Perhaps one of the most dramatic is the seismic surveys

used to look for oil and gas

Air guns produce loud blasts

sometimes every  to  seconds

for months on end

And they use the reflections of these sounds

to map the ground beneath

It can sound like this

Explosion sounds

Then there's the sound of the actual drilling for oil and gas

the construction of things like offshore wind farms

sonar

and of course the nearly constant drone from more than  ships

in the global merchant fleet

Now the natural ocean itself isn't exactly quiet

If you put your head under the water

you can hear cracking ice wind rain

singing whales grunting fish
fish
even snapping shrimp

Altogether that can create a soundscape

of maybe  to  decibels

depending on where and when you are

But mankind's addition to that has been dramatic

It's estimated that shipping has added three decibels of noise to the ocean

every  years in recent decades

That might not sound like a lot

but decibels are on a logarithmic scale

like the Richter scale for earthquakes

So a small number can actually represent a large change

Three decibels means a doubling of noise intensity in the ocean

A doubling

And that's only an estimate

because no one is actually keeping track of how noisy the ocean is

all around the world

There is a body called the International Quiet Ocean Experiment

and one of their missions

is to try and plug the hole in that data

So for example last year

they managed to convince the Global Ocean Observation System

to start including noise

as one of their essential variables for monitoring

alongside things like temperature and salinity

We do know some things

We know that sonar can be as loud or nearly as loud

as an underwater volcano

A supertanker can be as loud as the call of a blue whale

The noises we add to the ocean come in all different frequencies

and can travel great distances

Seismic surveys off the East Coast of the United States

can be heard in the middle of the Atlantic

In the s they did an experiment

where they set off a loud noise off the coast of Perth Australia

and they detected it as far away as Bermuda

 kilometers away

So what does all this sound like to marine life

what do they hear

It's kind of difficult to describe

Sound travels further faster in water than it does in air

and it also packs a different punch

So sound of the same pressure will have a different intensity

whether you measure it in the air or underwater

Then there's the fact that whales don't have ears exactly like human ears

Creatures like zooplankton

don't even have what you would consider to be ears

So what does this mean

what is the impact on all this marine life

Perhaps the easiest thing for scientists to assess

is the effect of acute noise

really loud sudden blasts

that might cause physical injury or hearing loss

Beaked whales for example can go into panicked dives

when exposed to loud noises
noise
which may even give them a condition similar to the bends

In the s after the introduction of more powerful sonar technologies

the number of incidents of mass whale strandings of beaked whales

went up dramatically

And it's not just marine mammals

fish if they stray too close to the source of a loud sound

their fish bladders may actually explode
bladder
The airgun blasts from seismic surveys

can mow down a swath of zooplankton

the tiny creatures near the base of the food chain

or can deform scallop larvae while they're developing

Well what about chronic noise

the more pervasive issue of raising background noise

from things like shipping

That can mask or drown out the natural soundscape

Some whales have responded to this by literally changing their tune

a little bit like people shouting to be heard in a noisy nightclub

And some fish will spend more time patrolling their borders

and less time caring for their young

as if they're on high alert

Chronic noise can affect people too of course

Studies have shown that people living near busy airports

or really busy highways

may have elevated levels of cardiovascular disease

And students living under busy flight paths

may do worse on some educational tests

And even while I was researching this subject

they were actually blasting out about three meters of solid granite

from the lot across from my home office

to make room for a new house

and the constant jittering of the rock hammer

was driving me completely insane

And whenever the workers stopped for a moment

I could feel my shoulders relax

This effect has been seen in whales too

After the terrorist attacks of 

international shipping largely ground to a halt for a little while

in the waters off the East Coast of the United States

And in that lull

researchers noticed that endangered right whales in that region

had fewer chemical markers of stress in their feces samples

As one researcher I spoke to likes to say

We were stressed but the whales weren't

Now you have to remember

we have evolved to be a visual species

We really rely on our eyes

But marine life relies on sound

the way that we rely on sight

For them a noisy ocean

may be as befuddling and even dangerous

as a dense fog is for us

And maybe sometimes that just means being a little more stressed

maybe sometimes it means spending a little less time with the kids

Maybe some species can adapt

But some researchers worry that for endangered species

already on the brink

noise may be enough to push them over the edge

So take for example the southern resident killer whales

that live in the waters off my hometown of Vancouver

There are only  maybe  animals left

in this population

And they're facing a lot of challenges

There are chemical pollutants in these waters

and they are running low on the salmon that they really rely on for food

And then there's noise

When researchers studied these and similar killer whales

they found that they spend between  and  percent less time

feeding in the presence of loud boat noise

And that's a lot for a species that's already struggling

to find enough food to thrive

The good news as I heard from all the researchers I spoke to

is that you can do something relatively easily about ocean noise

Unlike the wicked problems of climate change

and ocean acidification

you can just dial down the knob on ocean noise

and see almost immediate impacts

So for example in 

the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority

started asking ships to simply slow down

when going through the Haro Strait

where the southern resident killer whales are feeding in late summer

Slower ships are quieter ships

And because it's Canada you can just ask

it can be voluntary

Laughter

Applause

In that  trial most of the ships complied

adding about half an hour to their travel time

and reducing noise by about  decibels

or  percent of noise intensity

This year they decided to extend the length of time

and the area over which they're asking ships to slow down

So hopefully that has a positive impact for these whales

In  the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority

also introduced discounts in docking fees

for ships that are physically designed to be quieter

You know weirdly a lot of the noise from a ship like this

comes from the popping of tiny bubbles off the back of its propeller

And you can simply design a ship to do less of that

and to be quieter

The International Maritime Organization has published a huge list of ways

that boats can be made quieter

And they also have a target

of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from global shipping

by  percent by 

And the great news is that these two things go hand in hand

On the whole a more efficient ship is a quieter ship

People have also invented quieter ways of hammering in the giant posts

needed for giant wind turbines like this one

and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys

And there are some incentives for using quieter technologies

The European Union for example

has a healthy marine system directive for 

And one of the ways that they define a healthy marine system

is by how much noise is going in those waters

But on the whole most waters remain completely unregulated

when it comes to ocean noise

But again most of the scientists I spoke to

said that there's real momentum right now in policy circles

to pay attention to this issue

and maybe do something about this issue

We already know enough to say that quieter seas are healthier seas

But now scientists are really scrambling to come up with the details

Just how quiet do we need to be

And where are the best places to make quiet or preserve quiet

And how best can we hush our noise

And you know I'm not trying to tell you

that noise is the biggest environmental problem on the planet

or even in the ocean

But the point is that humankind has a lot of impacts

on our environmental system

And these impacts don't act in isolation

They act together and they multiply

So even for the ones that are not so obvious

we really need to pay attention to them

I'll tell you about one last experiment

just because it's so beautiful

So Rob Williams

one of the researchers who works on southern resident killer whales

also does some work in Bali

And there they celebrate a Hindu tradition

called nyepi or a day of silence

And this day apparently is very strictly observed

No planes take off from the airport

no boats go out fishing

the tourists are gently led off the beach back into their hotel rooms

And Rob Williams put some hydrophones in the water there
Rob Williams
to see what the impact was

and it was dramatic

Sound levels dropped by six to nine decibels

about the same as in the waters after 

For an acoustic prospector like Williams

which is what he calls himself

this silence is golden

Now he and other researchers can go back to this place

and see what the fish choose to do

with all this additional acoustic real estate

Soft bubbling

I like to think of them having their own holiday

feasting and finding mates

Celebrating their own spot of calm

in an otherwise noisy world

Thank you

Applause

So what do people usually say when you're about to give a public talk

It's to imagine that your audience is naked

Laughter

Well I'm doing a different trick tonight

and I'm going to imagine all of us without farmers

and well it's not so much different

[Without farmers you'd be hungry naked and sober]
[]
Laughter

And our farmers do so much more for us

than simply feed and clothe and provide us excellent things to drink

Our farmers are an important part of all of our communities

particularly our rural communities

And more than that

they're a strong driver of resilient economics

Think about it this way

When a brewer buys hops from me grown here in Minnesota

 percent of that dollar stays in our state

compared to just  percent when they buy it from somewhere else

What that means is a lot

That  percent means local jobs

It means tax revenue for better schools and roads

It means support for the coops the mechanics

all the support staff that are needed for a farm to thrive

And they're our best stewards of the land

This quote I think exemplifies what our family farmers do for us

in stewarding our shared natural resources

That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology

but that land is to be loved and respected as an extension of ethics

Now they sure do a lot of good stuff for us

And our family farmers are great we'd all agree

However

the trends in agriculture today are dire

The average age of a farmer in America

according to the latest agricultural census 



Of all the farmers

 percent are  plus

That's a little caricature of my grandpa

Laughter

He's still farming

and he's much older than 

But to put that in perspective

another important public service job teaching

average age of teachers is 

Our farmers are pretty old in this country

And unfortunately

when they retire if they retire

we're not really replacing them

Of all the farmers that we added in this country

between  and 

across the entire United States 

see if you can catch this difference 

we added  under the age of 

I'm one of those

I'll be around to autograph some photos later if you'd like

Laughter

But you know our farmers are getting older

and we're not replacing them 

what's going on here

What are we going to do

And I think there's a reason folks aren't coming into it

and that's prices

We're going to go through a couple of slides like this

Milk This is the average retail price of a gallon of milk in the United States

Four dollars fortynine cents

How much do you think the farmer gets

Dollar thirtytwo

We'll try again with bread

Average retail price of bread in America three fortynine

Farmer gets 

Twelve cents

Audience Oh

And so how are we supposed to have strong local farms

in this scenario

What are we supposed to do if there aren't any local farmers left

And this isn't just a farmer problem

it's not just something for the few of us farmers to sort out

This is an allofus problem

This is rural and it's urban and it's statewide and it's nationwide

So what do we do about it

I'll tell you that

But first a story

The green movement we're all kind of familiar

started in the 's planting trees

And now we've come such a long way

Green is part of our daytoday lives

It's part of the daytoday lives of Fortune  businesses

It's the subject of international treaties

the subject of presidential debates

You and I we switch our light bulbs

we use reusable bags

We participate in the green movement each and every day

Yet 

and this is how we get to the idea 

the food movement

relatively younger but also somewhat familiar I imagine

You go to the grocery store

you see a sign that says Buy local

you go to the farmers market you go to the coop

you read books by prominent authors

The food movement to date

could be summarized as voting with your fork

The idea is you pull a dollar out of your wallet 

how you spend that dollar affects the food system

It supports farmers close to home

And that's all well and good but where are we going

How do we get to our renewableenergy moment

like the green movement did

And this I think is what we need to do

Just voting with our fork is not solving the issues

that our farmers are facing

And so we need to do more than that

I believe we must move on from just voting with our fork

to voting with our vote

We need to take our dollars

and continue to spend them locally

We also need to show up at the ballot box for our farmers

This is bigger than just buying local strawberries

once a year at a pickyourown

This is a yearround effort that we must make together

to make the change we need

Changes like fair pricing for farmers

That's quotas supply management

guaranteed prices

Changes like fair and open trade

That means ending trade wars

And yeah of course it means voting

Now we all knew that one already though

For example it's working

Hey who's that

Laughter

Just this year in Minnesota

we've passed a historic firstinthecountry tax credit

The Beginning Farmer Tax Credit

It incentivizes our transition of land

from the existing generation to the next generation

That was done by a handful of us young farmers 

we certainly don't have money you saw that earlier

We don't have political experience

But we showed up and we made our voices heard

And thanks to the support of farmers and nonfarmers alike

we got something incredible done here in this state

If we can do it anybody can do it

Now that was all light and fuzzy and feels pretty happy

Skeptics in the audience you're here

That would be me if I were here

Skeptics are thinking

Wow what do we need to change about our food system

Farmers are great

We have unlimited food and it's real cheap too

isn't that great

Well unfortunately

in the 's and the 's in this country we went down a path of policy

that could be described as get big or get out

And what get big or get out means is you maximize production

while minimizing costs

On its face value that sounds pretty simple

However that shift turned our farmers from a venerated class

and a valued class in our society

into a cost to be minimized

That shift made it so that my greatgrandfather

who supported the family with six cows

that same dairy

trying to support their family has to be  cows today

Sixthousandcow dairies are not unheard of

What happens when there's this one dairy farm

in an entire county

where there used to be hundreds

The same could be said with corn or beans or field crops

What happens when it takes  acres for one person to support themselves

When it used to only take 

We know what happens we read about it in the news

Broadly determined rural decline

but schools close schools consolidate

post offices close grocery stores close

People leave

the community suffers and goes away

I believe all of us in this audience with ties to rural Minnesota

know this story well

This is not a problem that we can solve with farmers markets and good intentions

We have to do more for our farmers

Policy got us into this mess

and policy can get us out

American farmers are only getting older fewer and poorer

yet they are crucial to our state

They're the vibrancy in our rural communities

They're the drivers of economic growth and stability

and they are our best protectors of our shared resources

of land water and air

So we have to do better for them

So join me would you

Let's fight for our farmers

You can see it

we're already doing it in Minnesota having great success

And together we can do even more

And we must

So we were voting with our fork before

and we want to keep doing that

But if I could have one idea for you to go home with today

it's vote with your vote

And so to that end

on the count of three I'd like all of us to say it together

Are you ready

OK one

two

three

Audience Vote with your vote

Very nice thank you

I think you got it

Applause

Hi everybody

My name is Matt Cutts

and I worked at Google for almost  years
Google
As a distinguished engineer there

I was pretty close to the top of the Silicon Valley ecosystem

Then I decided to follow some inspiring folks

and do a short tour at the US Digital Service

That's the group of geeks that helped rescue HealthCaregov
HealthCaregov
when that website went down hard in 

Yeah

So I signed up for a threetosixmonth tour

and almost three years later

I'm still in Washington DC

working for the federal government

because the government really needs technologists right now

At my old job

every room had videoconferencing

integrated with calendars

power cables were built right into the furniture

When I moved to a government agency

I had to call a person to set up a phone conference

And when we moved to a new office

we didn't have furniture for a while

so we set up the phone on a trash can

One of the things that surprised me whenever I moved to DC

is how much the government still has to deal with paper

This is a facility in WinstonSalem

North Carolina

where people were worried

that the building might be structurally unsound

from the weight of all that paper

Yeah

Paper has some downsides

Here's a pop quiz

If your last name starts with H or higher
H
H or higher would you raise your hand
H
Wow

I have some bad news

Your veteran records might have been destroyed

in a fire in 

Laughter

Yeah

Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors

If you're a veteran

and you're applying for your health benefits

using a paper form

you might have to wait months for that form to be processed

We replaced that with a web form

and now most veterans find out

if they can get access to their health benefits

in  minutes

Applause

Here's another launch that I'm proud of

We worked with the Small Business Administration

to move one of their systems from paper to digital

So this is a picture from before

and this is afterwards

Same cubicles same people

just a better system for everyone

At one point we wanted to celebrate modernizing a different system

and so we went to a local grocery store

and we said Can you make a cake

and decorate it with the form that we've digitized

And the grocery store got really weirded out by that request

They wanted a letter on official government letterhead

Well we work for the government so we wrote a letter that said

You can use this publicdomain form

on a cake for celebratory purposes

Laughter

Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake

Yes dad jokes in government

Now I've talked a lot about paper

but we also bring up computer systems that go down

We bring in modern technology practices

like usercentered design and the cloud

and we also help improve procurement

It turns out government buys software

the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks

from government regulations that are over  pages long

So yes there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now

But if you think Silicon Valley is the savior in this story

Laughs

you've got another thing coming

Some of the best and brightest minds in technology

are working on mealdelivery startups

and scooters

and how to deliver weed to people better

Is that really the most important thing to work on right now

Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place

But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way

in government

This is somebody whose dad passed away

He hunted me down on Twitter

to say that a system that we had improved

worked well for him during a tough time

Those tough times are when government needs to work well

and why we need innovation in government

Now I have a confession to make

When I came to DC

I sometimes used words like bureaucrat

These days

I'm much more likely to use words like civil servant

Like Francine who can make you cry

Or at least she made me cry

because she's so inspiring

I am also deeply fiercely proud of my colleagues

They will work through illogical situations

and put in late nights to get to the right result

The government can't pay huge salary bonuses

so we ended up making our own awards

Our mascot is a crab named Molly

And so that award is actually a crabshaped purse

screwed into sheet metal

These days I believe less in silver bullets

that are going to fix everything

I believe more

in the people who show up to help

If you're looking for something deeply meaningful 

and full disclosure sometimes incredibly frustrating 

here's what you need to know

There is something difficult

and messy and vital and magical happening

when civil servants partner with technologists

at the city and state and national level

You don't have to do it forever

But you can make a difference in public service

right now

Thank you

Applause

Every science fiction writer

has a story about a time when the future arrived too soon

I have a lot of those stories

Like OK for example

years ago I was writing a story where the government

starts using drones to kill people

I thought that this was a really intense futuristic idea

but by the time the story was published

the government was already using drones to kill people

Our world is changing so fast

and there's a kind of accelerating feedback loop

where technological change and social change feed on each other

When I was a kid in the s

we knew what the future was going to look like

It was going to be some version of Judge Dredd or Blade Runner
 Dredd Blade Runner
It was going to be neon megacities and flying vehicles

But now nobody knows what the world is going to look like

even in just a couple years

and there are so many scary apparitions lurking on the horizon

From climate catastrophe to authoritarianism

everybody is obsessed with apocalypses

even though the world ends all the time and we keep going

Don't be afraid to think about the future to dream about the future

to write about the future

I've found it really liberating and fun to do that

It's a way of vaccinating yourself

against the worst possible case of future shock

It's also a source of empowerment

because you cannot prepare for something that you haven't already visualized

But there's something that you need to know

You don't predict the future

you imagine the future

So as a science fiction writer

whose stories often take place years or even centuries from now

I've found that people are really hungry for visions of the future

that are both colorful and lived in

but I found that research on its own is not enough to get me there

Instead I use a mixture of active dreaming

and awareness of cuttingedge trends in science and technology

and also insight into human history

I think a lot about what I know of human nature

and the way that people have responded in the past to huge changes

and upheavals and transformations

And I pair that with an attention to detail

because the details are where we live

We tell the story of our world through the tools we create

and the spaces that we live in

And at this point it's helpful to know a couple of terms

that science fiction writers use all of the time

future history and secondorder effects

Now future history is basically just what it sounds like

It is a chronology of things that haven't happened yet

like Robert A Heinlein's famous story cycle
Robert A Heinlein
which came with a detailed chart of upcoming events

going up into the year 

Or for my most recent novel

I came up with a really complicated time line

that goes all the way to the rd century

and ends with people living on another planet

Meanwhile a secondorder effect is basically the kind of thing

that happens after the consequences of a new technology or a huge change

There's a saying often attributed to writer and editor Frederik Pohl

that A good science fiction story

should predict not just the invention of the automobile

but also the traffic jam

And speaking of traffic jams

I spent a lot of time trying to picture the city of the future

What's it like What's it made of

Who's it for

I try to picture a green city with vertical farms

and structures that are partially grown rather than built

and walkways instead of streets

because nobody gets around by car anymore 

a city that lives and breathes

And you know I kind of start by daydreaming the wildest stuff

that I can possibly come up with

and then I go back into research mode

and I try to make it as plausible as I can

by looking at a mixture of urban futurism design porn

and technological speculation

And then I go back and I try to imagine what it would actually be like

to be inside that city

So my process kind of begins and ends with imagination

and it's like my imagination is two pieces of bread

in a research sandwich

So as a storyteller first and foremost

I try to live in the world through the eyes of my characters

and try to see how they navigate their own personal challenges

in the context of the space that I've created

What do they smell What do they touch

What's it like to fall in love inside a smart city

What do you see when you look out your window

and does it depend on how the window's software interacts with your mood

And finally I ask myself how a future brilliant city

would ensure that nobody is homeless and nobody slips through the cracks

And here's where future history comes in handy

because cities don't just spring up overnight like weeds

They arise and transform

They bear the scars and ornaments of wars migrations

economic booms cultural awakenings

A future city should have monuments yeah

but it should also have layers of past architecture

repurposed buildings

and all of the signs of how we got to this place

And then there's secondorder effects

like how do things go wrong  or right 

in a way that nobody ever anticipated

Like if the walls of your apartment are made out of a kind of fungus

that can regrow itself to repair any damage

what if people start eating the walls

Laughter

Speaking of eating

What kind of sewer system does the city of the future have

It's a trick question There are no sewers

There's something incredibly bizarre about the current system we have

in the United States

where your waste gets flushed into a tunnel

to be mixed with rainwater and often dumped into the ocean

Not to mention toilet paper

A bunch of techies led by Bill Gates
Bill Gates
are trying to reinvent the toilet right now

and it's possible that the toilet of the future

could appear incredibly strange to someone living today

So how does the history of the future all of that trial and error

lead to a better way to go to the bathroom

There are companies right now

who are experimenting with a kind of cleaning wand

that can substitute for toilet paper

using compressed air or sanitizing sprays to clean you off

But what if those things looked more like flowers than technology

What if your toilet could analyze your waste

and let you know if your microbiome might need a little tuneup

What if today's experiments with turning human waste into fuel

leads to a smart battery that could help power your home

But back to the city of the future

How do people navigate the space

If there's no streets how do people even make sense of the geography

I like to think of a place where there are spaces

that are partially only in virtual reality

that maybe you need special hardware to even discover

Like for one story I came up with a thing called the cloudscape interface
 cloudscape
which I described as a chrome spider that plugs into your head

using temporal nodes

No that's not a picture of it but it's a fun picture I took in a bar

Laughter

And I got really carried away imagining the bars restaurants cafs

that you could only find your way inside

if you had the correct augmented reality hardware

But again secondorder effects

in a world shaped by augmented reality

what kind of new communities will we have

what kind of new crimes that we haven't even thought of yet

OK like let's say that you and I are standing next to each other

and you think that we're in a noisy sports bar

and I think we're in a highbrow salon

with a string quartet talking about Baudrillard

I can't possibly imagine what might go wrong in that scenario

Like it's just  I'm sure it'll be fine

And then there's social media

I can imagine some pretty frickin' dystopian scenarios

where things like internet quizzes

dating apps horoscopes bots

all combine to drag you down deeper and deeper rabbit holes

into bad relationships and worse politics

But then I think about the conversations that I've had

with people who work on AI
AI
and what I always hear from them is that the smarter AI gets
AI
the better it is at making connections

So maybe the social media of the future will be better

Maybe it'll help us to form healthier less destructive relationships

Maybe we'll have devices that enable togetherness and serendipity

I really hope so

And you know I like to think that if strong AI ever really exists
AI
they'll probably enjoy our weird relationship drama

the same way that you and I love to obsess about the Real Housewives of Wherever

And finally there's medicine

I think a lot about how developments in genetic medicine

could improve outcomes for people with cancer or dementia

and maybe one day your hundredth birthday will be just another milestone

on the way to another two or three decades of healthy active life

Maybe the toilet of the future that I mentioned

will improve health outcomes for a lot of people

including people in parts of the world

where they don't have these complicated sewer systems that I mentioned

But also as a transgender person

I like to think What if we make advances in understanding the endocrine system

that improve the options for trans people

the same way that hormones and surgeries expanded the options

for the previous generation

So finally basically I'm here to tell you

people talk about the future

as though it's either going to be a technological wonderland

or some kind of apocalyptic poop barbecue

Laughter

But the truth is it's not going to be either of those things

It's going to be in the middle It's going to be both It's going to be everything

The one thing we do know

is that the future is going to be incredibly weird

Just think about how weird the early st century would appear

to someone from the early th

And you know there's a kind of logical fallacy that we all have

where we expect the future to be an extension of the present

Like people in the s

thought that the Soviet Union would still be around today

But the future is going to be much weirder than we could possibly dream of
dream
But we can try

And I know that there are going to be scary scary things

but there's also going to be wonders and saving graces

And the first step to finding your way forward

is to let your imagination run free

Thank you

Applause

Most of you will know

about the challenges faced by my beloved continent Africa

Too many people are poor

Millions of girls don't have access to school

And there aren't enough jobs for the rapidly growing population

Every day

 new young people join the search for employment

That's  million for three million formal jobs

In subSaharan Africa

less than one in four young people are likely to get waged or salaried work

The chances of making a secure living

are even slimmer for poor and rural young women

They cannot afford an education

And they do not have the same access to wages loans or land

as men

This leaves entire communities trapped

in a vicious cycle of poverty inequality and hopelessness

But I'm not here to narrate the doom and gloom

because we also know that a youthful population

presents an opportunity to kickstart economic growth

and solve global challenges

And in fact

there is a growing movement in Africa of educated young women

who are stepping up and using the power of their network

and a tool we call social interest

to uplift communities

I'm one of the leaders of the organization behind this movement

An organization that also supported me through school

And I have seen social interest multiply the impact of our work

Social interest is a way to pay back interest on a loan

through service rather than dollars

Sharing time and knowledge through mentoring

academic support

business training to others in need

This means the impact of a loan is felt not by one but by many

Through this system

we've been able to help and send more and more girls to school

support them while they are there

help them start businesses

and ultimately lead in their communities 

all while providing funding for the next generation

Social interest can be used

to supercharge any movement where the benefits can be paid forward

Let me give you an example

This is Stumai from rural Tanzania
Stumai
She tragically lost her father when she was just three years old

Leaving a disabled mother to singlehandedly raise her

and her five siblings

Once Stumai completed primary school
Stumai
she was about to drop out of school

and become one of the  percent of girls in subSaharan Africa

that never finish high school

Instead she got lucky

She got support from a nonprofit that paid her fees

and kept her in school

But upon graduating high school

she faced a daunting challenge of what's next

She knew she had to start her own business to survive

And to help her mother

who had tried so hard to keep her in school

by selling her only assets

a stack of corrugated iron sheets she had been saving

in the hope of building a better home for her children

Stumai also knew she wouldnt get a loan from a traditional bank
Stumai
which generally considers young rural women like her

without land or assets unbankable

Through a special group of lending partners

she secured  dollars to start a food shop

selling vegetables oil rice tomatoes onions and beans

Fellow network members helped to train her on basic business skills

like creating a business plan

working out profits marketing

keeping business records

and the value of savings

And the business took off

She repaid the original loan within eight months

and then borrowed  dollars

to start a motorcycle taxi and courier business

Stumai now owns two motorcycles
Stumai
and employs two people

And she has been able to purchase land and build a house

and the business continues to grow

from strength to strength

Stumai repaid her interest in social interest

She paid social interest

by providing mentoring to girls in a local high school

She volunteered weekly as a learner guide

delivering a life skills and wellbeing curriculum

that helps children gain the confidence to ask questions

care for and support each other

learn about health and nutrition

set goals and learn how to achieve them

Stumai says her greatest reward is witnessing the girls she mentors

start to believe in themselves and succeeding

These days Stumai also trains other learner guides
Stumai
That's multiplying the number of girls making it through school

and into secure livelihoods like she did

Through her business profits she has been able to support her siblings

three nieces and nephews and other children in her community

to go to school

She also regularly supports other network members

For example

a young woman studying for a diploma in community development

In the past two years

Stumai helped her with money for bus fare

for sanitary pads for soap

and encouraged her to keep going

Stumai spends  dollars a year supporting the education of others

That's  percent of her gross earnings from her motorcycle business

This is the power of social interest

Stumai's example shows that if you help one girl
Stumai
not only to go to school

but graduate and start a business

she can in turn make a giant difference

in the lives of others and her community

Had Stumai paid back interest on her loan in dollars

her success might have been felt by her and her immediate family

but because she paid interest as social interest

the impact was felt by her mentees

her nieces nephews her employees

and so many others around her

Stumai is just one example of many
Stumai
Today we have  learner guides like Stumai
Stumai
working across Malawi

Tanzania Ghana Zambia and Zimbabwe

And collectively

they've helped children do better in school

The girls we work with are nearly three times less likely

to drop out of school

because learner guides make home visits when girls fail to attend school

to help them back on track

They also work with communities and district governments

to address the challenges children face

including preventing or annulling child marriages

connecting children facing hunger or hardship at home

with local support

or running study groups

so that children who might be lagging behind in their studies

can get supporters and catch up

They act as trusted sisters friends and guardians

So far nearly  network members

have borrowed close to three million dollars

with a repayment rate of those loans at consistently above  percent

And our  members

they have invested their own resources

to support and send

over  children to primary and secondary school

Every young woman we work with

supports on average another three children

outside of her immediate family

to go to school

All without additional money from us

We are building a powerful force

Gaining ever greater momentum

as we open the door for more and more girls

to go to school

succeed lead and in turn support thousands more

This system

supporting those once excluded to transform their lives

and then step up for others

can work for more than girls' education

Of course you need to get your money back if you lend it

But instead of demanding interest in dollars

can you consider using social interest instead

For example

could young people

pass on the skills they learned in training colleges

Like Michelle

who teaches brickmaking in rural Zimbabwe

Or Louisa

who is training others on climatesmart agriculture

in Malawi

Or Fatima in Ghana

who is training women to help deliver babies

where expectant mothers

might not be able to make it to the local hospital on time

When I was growing up

an elder in my village in rural Zimbabwe

once described the challenges I faced in going to school

She said

Those who harvest many pumpkins

often do not have the clay pots to cook them in

Laughter

What she meant was that

although I got the best possible results in my exams

when I finished elementary school

my talent was of no value

if my family could not afford to pay for me to continue my education

Well with this system

we are not just providing pots

or making a single meal out of the pumpkins

After all

there are hundreds of seeds in a single pumpkin

We are saving the seeds

planting them

and nurturing every one of them

And the result

A virtual cycle of prosperity

equality and hope

led by young women

Because together

we are shaking up the world

Pamoja tunaweza 
Pamoja tunaweza
that's Swahili for my network motto Together we can

Thank you

Reviewer Krystian Aparta
OK
So we are going to start in 
when a German scientist
was looking through a microscope
at insect cells
And he saw something kind of funny
At the center of the cells
there was this dark stuff
No one had ever seen it before
And he noticed that as the cells
would multiply and divide
it would go into some of the new cells
but not the others
He didn't know what it was
so he gave it a really great name
He called it the X element
Laughter
And he was like
We'll just fill in that X later
And then fastforward  years later
and there is an American scientist
and she is looking through her microscope
also at insect cells
And she sees something funny
There's more of this dark stuff
And it's kind of tiny
it's hanging out near the X element
And eventually someone was like
Well if that one thing's called X
should we call this other thing Y
And like that Snaps fingers
the sex chromosomes had been discovered
So chromosomes
you probably all know what they are
but I will tell you anyways
They're made up of DNA 
everything has it
it's the blueprint of life
we've got rats we've got trees
we've got insects we've got humans
And in the case of human chromosomes
geneticist Melissa Wilson
broke it down for me like this
Audio Melissa Wilson Typically
you'll get one copy of every chromosome
from your genetic mom
and one copy of every chromosome
from your genetic dad
and we have  of these
that you get one copy from mom
and one copy from dad
And then there's a rd pair X and Y
Molly Webster So while all
the other chromosomes are numbered
one through 
we do not call X and Y 
I like to think that they are waiting
for like a LeBron James to come along
But in this instance they were like
We're just going to keep the letters
and then we'll give them a title
They called them the sex chromosomes
Now I would wager
that in the United States
these are the most wellknown chromosomes
for one simple fact
that we say X equals girl
and Y equals boy 
that they are responsible for sex
And  and I had to learn this 
but when I'm talking about sex here
I'm talking about the way biology
gives us gonads
which are our ovaries and our testes 
I'm not talking about gender
which is how we identify
And so as a reporter at the show 
Radiolab the audio documentary
program I work for 
I was like what's up
with these sex chromosomes
You know that's kind of my job
I think things are weird
and then I get to call people about them
and ask questions
and then hopefully they answer
And in this case
a lot of people answered
And in the two years I had
of reporting on X and Y
as part of Gonads
the series on sex and gender
I ended up doing for Radiolab
I found out that these two chromosomes
live in a world that is unexpected
a little unsettling
where things that I thought were facts
were like twisted in ways
I hadn't seen before
And the world goes so far
beyond the boundaries of sex
I was like
Maybe we should all talk about this
So you're you all
we're all going to talk about it
And for me
the true story of X and Y
starts with their name
So within years of being discovered
these two little chromosomes
had acquired more than  different names
There was diplosome and heterochromosome
and idiochromosome
and most of the names had to do
with their structure their shape
their size
And then there was sex chromosome
which they had been given
because of the fact
that we had started seeing that the X
would go with the females
and the Y would often go with the males
But scientists were like
Do we really want
to call them sex chromosomes
And science historian Sarah Richardson
is the one who told me this story
Audio Sarah Richardson
For three decades scientists were like
You should not call them
the sex chromosomes
The X and Y have many functions
and you wouldn't assume
that a single chromosome
controls a single trait
Imagine calling one chromosome
the 'urogenital chromosome'
or the 'liver chromosome'
MW Scientists if you dig 
into the history 
it's really cool you should 
were hesitant to like
commit to such a specific name
and such a powerfully connotated name
There was a fear that it would
actually be really limiting 
maybe to science maybe to society 
but the fear was in the room
And you can see they ended up
getting sex chromosome 
it's like a pretty juicy title
it popularized genetics you know
But in the year history
since we settled on that name
you can see it starts
to get a little complicated
So around  
this is going to be our first stop
on the complicated world
of the sex chromosomes 
so around 
we had discovered that you could be XYY
They discovered an XYY man
And to digress a little here
it turns out that the model
of X equals girl and Y equals boy
is really simplistic
You can actually be a whole bunch
of different combinations of X and Y
giving you like different types
of biological sex
You could be two Xs and two Ys together
You could be four Xs
you could be five Xs
you could be XO
And so I thought that was pretty crazy
because I was like
Wow this really upends
a model of biological sex
I think most of us in this room
have been taught
So a few years after they realized
that you can be XYY
researchers go to a prison in Scotland
and they do genetic analysis
of a bunch of the male prisoners
And they find a number
of people who are XYY
And according to Sarah
Audio SR They just rushed
to publish a theory
suggesting that this extra Y chromosome
could explain criminality in some men
MW Yeah
So the logic goes like this
By this point we're thinking Y is male
We think male is aggressive
so Y must be aggression
If you've got an extra Y
you must be crazy
And like we went nuts with this theory
We called it the supermale
they started scanning more prisoners
serial killers boys
And in all seriousness
there was actually a suggestion
that we consider aborting XYY fetuses
So in 
this theory pretty much toppled
for a number of reasons
One
there had been this really large study
that basically showed
there was no connection
between Y and violence
I think we all saw that coming
And then there was one other thing
Audio SR Going back
and looking at those original findings
in that highsecurity
psychiatric institution
they had also found
a high number of individuals
with an extra X chromosome
So these are XXY as opposed to XYY
Audio MW Really
Audio SR Yeah 
Now they never claimed
that the individuals
with an extra X chromosome
were superfemales
They never investigated
whether they had higher rates of violence
MW Seems like kind of an oversight
I don't know
But I think it's interesting
because what you see is if you start
looking at these chromosomes
through the lens of sex
what naturally falls in place behind
is we look at them
through the lens of gender
and the traits
that we associate with gender
So men were violent
and Y explained why they were in prison
The X did not do that
because like you know what's X
We don't associate it with violence
And while we don't believe
in supermales today 
God I hope we don't 
we don't believe in supermales today
there is a very similar conversation
that's still happening
around inherent violence
in boys and biology
So my next stop
on the weird world of X and Y
or things feeling
a little topsyturvy is 
The World University Games
were set to happen in Japan
and the Spanish hurdler Mara Jos
MartnezPatio was scheduled to run
She was like a hot shot
a rising superstar
And the night before her race
they had her DNA scanned
Now at the time this was a thing
that they were doing
because they were like
OK we don't want men
covertly racing as women
so we're going to scan the women
and make sure all their Xs line up
And so I heard this story
from Ruth Padawer
who was a New York Times Magazine reporter
and she reported on Mara
Audio Ruth Padawer So they tell her
the chromosome test results were abnormal
Although on the outside
she was fully female
she had XY chromosomes
and these internal testes
MW They were like
We hate to break it to you Mara
but you're actually a dude
You can't race with the ladies
Audio RP And so she's thrown
off the national team
she's expelled from
the athletics residence
she's denied her scholarship
a bunch of her friends dump her
fellow athletes abandon her
she loses her medals
her records are revoked
MW So it turns out 
remember when I told you
you can be a bunch of different
combinations of X and Y 
you can also be XY and be female
You can be XX and male
In Mara's case she was something called
androgen insensitive
Which means that she did have
some sort of internal testes 
they were making testosterone 
but her body couldn't use it
And so if you thought of testosterone
as like a superpower
she was not benefiting from it
And so eventually
sports authorities like let her back in
but her career was done
And in this instance you see how
if you assign sex
to a specific place in the body
or at least like
this is what I saw right
If you assign sex
to a specific place in the body
it somehow makes us think
that we can go into a body
look at a specific place
and tell someone we know
something more about them
than they know about themselves
And that feels terrifying to me
And we don't genetically test
female athletes anymore
but you can see very similar
conversations happening
when we talk about testosterone in sports
you can also see it in suggestions
that we take transgender individuals
and we genetically analyze them
and we tell them who they are
That is real
that is a conversation
that has happened recently
The last place that I'll share with you
where these chromosomes
got complicated for me
is this one thing that Melissa told me
Audio Wilson You can't 
survive without an X chromosome
No matter your gonads
no matter your identity
every single human being
has to have an X chromosome
because without one
the rest of your body doesn't develop
MW Why do we call this
the female chromosome
OK this is something
I had never though about
but literally every single person
in this audience has an X chromosome
I'm not lying
Every single person on the planet
has an X chromosome
but no one is going around like
This is the everyperson chromosome
You know
Like somehow it's over here
the Y is over there
and they must be really different
and I'm just like
it would be so much better
if it was the everyperson chromosome
And not just because I'm like
love you all and I want you all in
but because of what we're overlooking
by the fact that we consider it female
Because I'm going to tell you
one of the craziest things I found out
Which is when you think
about the X chromosome
of the almost  genes
on the X chromosome
how many do you think have to do
with sex and reproduction
Like get a number in your head
Four percent
That means  percent
of the rest of that chromosome
is doing something that has nothing
to do with your gonads
And I guess as all of these
sort of some of them social stories
some of them scientific stories
some of these facts
started to add up I just thought like
why are we calling these
the sex chromosomes
Or if we are like
maybe we all like that name
should we just allow ourselves
to think about them
a little more broadly
Because if we do
like what insights would we gain
as people as scientists
And we're at this point
where we're thinking about like
how do we want to teach science
what do we want to fund
like who do we want to be
as a society you know
And I just wondered if it wasn't a moment
to rethink the biology of X and Y
and at the very least
to remember like
the footnotes of history
which is that the dude who came up
with the phrase sex chromosome
actually was like Hey everyone
just remember this is just
and I quote a form of shorthand
We should not take it literally
Thank you

In the future

selfdriving cars will be safer and more reliable than humans

But for this to happen

we need technologies that allow cars to respond

faster than humans

we need algorithms that can drive better than humans

and we need cameras that can see more than humans can see

For example imagine a selfdriving car is about to make a blind turn

and there's an oncoming car

or perhaps there's a child about to run into the street

Fortunately our future car will have this superpower

a camera that can see around corners to detect these potential hazards

For the past few years as a PhD student

in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab

I've been working on a camera that can do just this 

a camera that can image objects hidden around corners

or blocked from direct line of sight

So let me give you an example of what our camera can see

This is an outdoor experiment we conducted

where our camera system is scanning the side of this building with a laser

and the scene that we want to capture

is hidden around the corner behind this curtain

So our camera system can't actually see it directly

And yet somehow

our camera can still capture the D geometry of this scene
D
So how do we do this

The magic happens here in this camera system

You can think of this as a type of highspeed camera

Not one that operates at  frames per second

or even a million frames per second

but a trillion frames per second

So fast that it can actually capture the movement of light itself

And to give you an example of just how fast light travels

let's compare it to the speed of a fastrunning comic book superhero

who can move at up to three times the speed of sound

It takes a pulse of light about  billionths of a second

or  nanoseconds

to travel the distance of a meter

Well in that same time

our superhero has moved less than the width of a human hair

That's pretty fast

But actually we need to image much faster

if we want to capture light moving at subcentimeter scales

So our camera system can capture photons

at time frames of just  trillionths of a second

or  picoseconds

So we take this ultrahighspeed camera

and we pair it with a laser that sends out short pulses of light

Each pulse travels to this visible wall

and some light scatters back to our camera

but we also use the wall to scatter light around the corner

to the hidden object and back

We repeat this measurement many times

to capture the arrival times of many photons

from different locations on the wall

And after we capture these measurements we can create

a trillionframepersecond video of the wall

While this wall may look ordinary to our own eyes

at a trillion frames per second we can see something truly incredible

We can actually see waves of light scattered back from the hidden scene

and splashing against the wall

And each of these waves carries information

about the hidden object that sent it

So we can take these measurements

and pass them into a reconstruction algorithm

to then recover the D geometry of this hidden scene
D
Now I want to show you one more example of an indoor scene that we captured

this time with a variety of different hidden objects

And these objects have different appearances

so they reflect light differently

For example this glossy dragon statue reflects light differently

than the mirror disco ball

or the white discus thrower statue

And we can actually see the differences in the reflected light

by visualizing it as this D volume
D
where we've just taken the video frames and stacked them together

And time here is represented as the depth dimension of this cube

These bright dots that you see are reflections of light

from each of the mirrored facets of the disco ball

scattering against the wall over time

The bright streaks of light that you see arriving soonest in time

are from the glossy dragon statue that's closest to the wall

and the other streaks of light come from reflections of light from the bookcase

and from the statue

Now we can also visualize these measurements frame by frame

as a video

to directly see the scattered light

And again here we see first reflections of light from the dragon

closest to the wall

followed by bright dots from the disco ball

and other reflections from the bookcase

And finally we see the reflected waves of light from the statue

These waves of light illuminating the wall

are like fireworks that last for just trillionths of a second

And even though these objects reflect light differently

we can still reconstruct their shapes

And this is what you can see from around the corner

Now I want to show you one more example that's slightly different

In this video you see me dressed in this reflective suit

and our camera system is scanning the wall at a rate of four times every second

The suit is reflective

so we can actually capture enough photons

that we can see where I am and what I'm doing

without the camera actually directly imaging me

By capturing photons that scatter from the wall to my tracksuit

back to the wall and back to the camera

we can capture this indirect video in real time

And we think that this type of practical nonlineofsight imaging

could be useful for applications including for selfdriving cars

but also for biomedical imaging

where we need to see into the tiny structures of the body

And perhaps we could also put similar camera systems on the robots

that we send to explore other planets

Now you may have heard about seeing around corners before

but what I showed you today would have been impossible

just two years ago

For example we can now image large roomsized hidden scenes outdoors

and at realtime rates

and we've made significant advancements towards making this a practical technology

that you could actually see on a car someday

But of course there's still challenges remaining

For example can we image hidden scenes at long distances

where we're collecting very very few photons
Where we're collecting very very few photons
with lasers that are lowpower and that are eyesafe

Or can we create images from photons

that have scattered around many more times

than just a single bounce around the corner

Can we take our prototype system that's well currently large and bulky

and miniaturize it into something that could be useful

for biomedical imaging

or perhaps a sort of improved homesecurity system

or can we take this new imaging modality and use it for other applications

I think it's an exciting new technology

and there could be other things that we haven't thought of yet

to use it for

And so well a future with selfdriving cars

may seem distant to us now 

we're already developing the technologies

that could make cars safer and more intelligent

And with the rapid pace of scientific discovery and innovation

you never know what new and exciting capabilities

could be just around the corner

Applause

I'm an immigrant from Venezuela

and I've lived in the US for six years

If you ask me about my life as an expatriate

I would say that I've been lucky

But it hasn't been easy

Growing up I never thought that I was going to leave my homeland

I participated in my first student protest in 

when the president shut down one of the most important news networks

I was getting my bachelor's degree in communications

and that was the first time I realized I couldn't take free speech for granted

We knew things were getting bad but we never saw what was coming

an economic crisis infrastructure breaking down

citywide electrical blackouts

the decline of public health care and shortage of medicines

disease outbreaks and starvation

I moved to Canada with my husband in 

and we always thought we'd move back home when the crisis improved

But we never did

Nearly all my childhood friends have left the country

but my parents are still there

There have been moments where I've called my mom

and I could hear people screaming and crying in the background

as teargas bombs exploded in the streets

And my mom as if I couldn't hear it would always tell me

Speaking Spanish

We're fine don't worry

But of course I worry

It's my parents and I'm  miles away

Today I'm just one of more than four million Venezuelans

who have left their home country

A lot of my friends are Venezuelan immigrants

and in the last few years

we've begun talking about how we could make a difference

when we live so far away

That is how Code for Venezuela was born in 

It began with a hackathon because we are experts in tech

and we thought we could use our tech skills

to create solutions for people on the ground

But first we needed to find some experts actually living inside Venezuela

to guide us

We'd see so many other hackathons

that came up with wily ambitious incredible technological solutions

that sounded great in theory but ultimately failed to work

in the actual countries they were intended to help

Many of us have been living abroad for years

and we are detached from the daytoday problems

that people are facing in Venezuela

So we turned to the experts actually living inside of the country

For example Julio Castro
Julio Castro
a doctor and one of the leaders of Mdicos por la Salud

When the government stopped publishing official health care data in 

Dr Julio began collecting information himself
Julio
using an informal but coordinated system

of cell phone communications

They track available personnel medical supplies mortality data

disease outbreaks

compile it into a report

and then share that on Twitter
Twitter
He became our goto expert on health care in Venezuela

Luis Carlos Daz

a widely recognized journalist who reports acts of censorship

and human rights violations suffered by the people of Venezuela

he helps us make sense of what is happening there

since the news is controlled by the government

We call these people our heroes on the ground

With their expert advice we came up with a series of challenges

for hackathon participants

In that first hackathon we had  participants

from seven countries

come up with  different project submissions

We picked the projects with the most potential

and continued working on them after the event

Today I'll share two of our most successful projects

to give you a taste of the impact we are having so far

They're called MediTweet and Blackout Tracker
MediTweetBlackout Tracker
MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot
MediTweetTwitter
that helps Venezuelans find the medicine they need

Right now in Venezuela

if you get sick and you go to a hospital

there is a good chance they won't have the right medical supplies to treat you

The situation is so bad

that patients often get a shopping list from the doctor

instead of a prescription

I live the need for this firsthand

My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 

She needed to have a lumbar puncture

to get a final diagnosis and treatment plan

But the needle for this procedure wasn't available

I was in Venezuela at that time

and I was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day

After looking everywhere we found the needle in a site

that is like the eBay of Latin America
eBay
I met the seller in a local bakery

and it was like buying something on the black market

My mom brought the needle to her doctor and he did the procedure

Without this she could have died

But it's not just medical supplies

it's medicines too

When she was first diagnosed

we bought her treatment in a state pharmacy

and it was like practically free

But then the state pharmacy ran out

and we still had six months of treatment ahead

Six months of treatment ahead

We bought some medicines online and the rest in Mexico

Now she's in her third year of remission

and every time that I call

she tells me I'm fine don't worry

But not everyone can afford to leave the country

and many aren't healthy enough to travel

That is why people turn to Twitter
Twitter
buying and selling medicines using the hashtag ServicioPublico
ServicioPublico
meaning public service

Our Twitter bot scans Twitter for the hashtag ServicioPublico
TwitterTwitterServicioPublico
and connects users who are asking for specific medicines

with those who are selling their private leftovers

We also pool the location data of those Twitter users
Twitter
and use it for a visualization tool

It gives local organizations like Mdicos por la Salud
Mdicospor la Salud
a sense of where they have a shortage

We can also apply machine learning algorithms

to detect clusters of disease

If they've received humanitarian aid

this could help them to make better decisions

about the distributions of the supplies

Our second project is called Blackout Tracker

Venezuela is currently going through an electricity crisis

Last year Venezuela suffered what some people consider

the worst power failures in Venezuelan history

I had two long days without communication with my parents

Some cities experienced blackouts every day

But you only know about this on social media

The government won't report blackouts on the news

When the power goes out

many Venezuelans we quickly tweet out the location with the hashtag SinLuz
SinLuz
meaning without electricity

before their phones ran out of battery

so people around the country know what is happening

Like MediTweet
MediTweet
Blackout Tracker scans Twitter for the hashtag SinLuz
TwitterSinLuz
and creates a map using the location data of those users

You can quickly see

where the blackouts are happening today

and how many blackouts have happened over time

People want to know what is happening

and this is our answer

But it's also a way of holding the government accountable

It's easy for them to deny that the problem exists

or make excuses

because there is no official data on it

Blackout Tracker shows how bad the problem really is

Now some people in Silicon Valley may look at these projects

and say that there are no major technological innovations

But that is the point

These projects are not insanely advanced

but it's what the people of Venezuela need

and they can have a tremendous impact

Beyond these projects perhaps our most significant accomplishment

is that a movement has been created

one where people around the world are coming together

to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of Venezuela

And because we are partnering with locals

we are creating the solutions that people want and need

What is so great about this

is that we are using our professional skills

so it comes easily and naturally

It's not that hard for us to make a difference

If someone from San Francisco

were to hire professionals to create solutions

like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker
MediTweetBlackout Tracker
it would cost a small fortune

By donating our services

we are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money

And you can do the same thing 

not in Venezuela necessarily

but in your own community

In a world that is more connected than ever

we still see how specialized communities can be living isolated or in silos

There are so many great ways to help

but I believe that you can use your professional skills

to connect diverse communities and create effective solutions

through those relationships

Anyone with knowledge and professional skills

has a powerful force to bring hope to a community

For us at Code for Venezuela

this is just the beginning

Thank you

[An ode to living on Earth]

Hello

I'm sure by the time I get to end of this sentence

given how I talk

you'll all have figured out that I'm from a place called

planet Earth

Earth is pretty great

It's home to us

And germs

Those [blip] take a back seat for the time being
[]
because believe it or not they're not the only thing going on

This planet is also home to cars brussels sprouts

those weird fish things that have their own headlights

art fire

fire extinguishers

laws pigeons bottles of beer

lemons and light bulbs

Pinot noir and paracetamol

ghosts mosquitoes flamingos flowers

the ukulele elevators and cats

cat videos the internet

iron beams buildings and batteries

all ingenuity and bright ideas all known life 

and a whole bunch of other stuff

Pretty much everything we know and ever heard of

It's my favorite place actually

This small orb

floating in a cold and lonely part of the cosmos

Oh the accent is from Belfast by the way which is 

here

Roughly

You may think you know this planet Earth

as you're from here

But chances are

you probably haven't thought about the basics in a while

I thought I knew it

Thought I was an expert even

Until that is I had to explain the entire place

and how it's supposed to work

to someone who had never been here before

Not what you might think

although my dad always did say

the sure sign of intelligent life out there

is that they haven't bothered trying to contact us

It was actually my newborn son I was trying to explain things to

We'd never been parents before

my wife and I

and so treated him like most guests when he arrived home for the first time

by giving him the tour

This is where you live son

This room is where we make food at

This is the room we keep our collection of chairs and so on

It's refreshing

explaining how our planet works to a zeroyearold

But after the laughs

and once the magnitude that new humans know absolutely nothing

settles on you and how little you know either

explaining the whole planet becomes quite intimidating

But I tried anyway

As I walked around those first few weeks

narrating the world as I saw it

I began to take notes of the ridiculous things I was saying

The notes slowly morphed into a letter

intended for my son once he learned to read

And that letter became a book

about the basic principles of what it is to be a human

living on Earth in the st century

Some things are really obvious

Like the planet is made of two parts

land and sea

Some less obvious until you think about them

Like time

Things can sometimes move slowly here on Earth

But more often they move quickly

So use your time well it will be gone before you know it

Or people

People come in all different shapes sizes and colors

We may all look different

act different and sound different

but don't be fooled

We are all people

It doesn't skip me that of all the places in the universe

people only live on Earth

can only live on Earth

And even then only on some of the dry bits

There's only a very small part of the surface of our planet

that is actually habitable to human life

and squeezed in here is where all of us live

It's easy to forget when you're up close to the dirt

the rocks the foliage the concrete of our lands

just how limited the room for maneuvering is

From a set of eyes close to the ground

the horizon feels like it goes forever

After all it's not an everyday ritual

to consider where we are on the ball of our planet

and where that ball is in space

I didn't want to tell my son the same story of countries

that we were told where I was growing up in Northern Ireland

That we were from just a small parish

which ignores life outside its immediate concerns

I wanted to try to feel what it was like to see our planet

as one system as a single object

hanging in space

To do this

I would need to switch from flat drawings for books

to D sculpture for the street
D
and I'd need almost  feet

a New York City block

to build a largescale model of the moon

the Earth and us

This project managed to take place on New York City's High Line park

last winter

on the th anniversary of Apollo 's mission around the Moon

After its installation

I was able to put on a space helmet with my son

and launch like Apollo  did half a century ago

towards the Moon

We circled around

and looked back at us

What I felt was

how lonely it was there in the dark

And I was just pretending

The Moon is the only object

even remotely close to us

And at the scale of this project

where our planet was  feet in diameter

Mars the next planet will be the size of a yoga ball

and a couple of miles away

Although borders are not visible from space

on my sculpture

every single border was drawn in

But rather than writing the country names on the carvedup land

I wrote over and over again

people live here people live here

People live here

And off on the Moon it was written

No one lives here

Often the obvious things

aren't all that obvious until you think about them

Seeing anything from a vast enough distance

changes everything

as many astronauts have experienced

And human eyes have only ever seen our Earth

from as far as the Moon really

It's quite a ways further

before we get to the edges of our own Solar System

And even out to other stars to the constellations

There is actually only one point in the entire cosmos

that is present in all constellations of stars

and that presence is

here planet Earth

Those pictures we have made up for the clusters of stars

only make sense from this point of view down here

Their stories only make sense here on Earth

And only something to us

To people

We are creatures of stories

We are the stories we tell

we're the stories we're told

Consider briefly the story of human civilization on Earth

It tells of the ingenuity elegance

generous and nurturing nature of a species

that is also selffocused vulnerable

and defiantly protective

We the people shield the flame of our existence

from the raw vast elements outside our control

the great beyond

Yet it is always to the flame we look

For all we know

when said as a statement

it means the sum total of all knowledge

But when said another way

for all we know

it means that we do not know at all

This is the beautiful fragile drama of civilization

We are the actors and spectators of a cosmic play

that means the world to us here

but means nothing anywhere else

Possibly not even that much down here either

If we truly thought about our relationship with our boat

with our Earth

it might be more of a story of ignorance and greed

As is the case with Fausto
Fausto
a man who believed he owned everything

and set out to survey what was his

He easily claims ownership of a flower

a sheep a tree and a field

The lake and the mountain prove harder to conquer

but they too surrender

It is in trying to own the open sea

where his greed proves his undoing

when in a fit of arrogance

he climbs overboard to show that sea who is boss

But he does not understand

slips beneath the waves sinks to the bottom

The sea was sad for him

but carried on being the sea

As do all the other objects of his ownership

for the fate of Fausto does not matter to them

For all the importance in the cosmos we believe we hold

we'd have nothing

if not for this Earth

While it would keep happily spinning

obliviously without us

On this planet there are people

We have gone about our days

sometimes we look up and out

mostly we look down and in

Looking up and by drawing lines between the lights in the sky

we've attempted to make sense out of chaos

Looking down we've drawn lines across the land to know where we belong

and where we don't

We do mostly forget that these lines that connect the stars

and those lines that divide the land

live only in our heads

They too are stories

We carry out our everyday routines and rituals

according to the stories we most believe in

and these days the story is changing as we write it

There is a lot of fear in this current story

and until recently

the stories that seemed to have the most power

are those of bitterness

of how it had all gone wrong for us individually and collectively

It has been inspiring to watch how the best comes from the worst

How people are waking up in this time of global reckoning

to the realization that our connections with each other

are some of the most important things we have

But stepping back

For all we've had to lament

we spend very little time relishing the single biggest thing

that has ever gone right for us

That we are here in the first place

that we are alive at all

That we are still alive

A million and a half years after finding a box of matches

we haven't totally burned the house down

Yet

The chances of being here are infinitesimal

Yet here we are

Perils and all

There have never been more people living on Earth

Using more stuff

And it's become obvious that many of the old systems

we invented for ourselves

are obsolete

And we have to build new ones

If it wasn't germs

our collective fire might suffocate us before long

As we watch the wheels of industry grind to a halt

the machinery of progress become silent

we have the wildest of opportunities

to hit the reset button

To take a different path

Here we are on Earth

And life on Earth is a wonderful thing

It looks big this Earth

but there are lots of us on here

Seven and a half billion at last count

with more showing up every day

Even so

there is still enough for everyone

if we all share a little

So please

be kind

When you think of it another way

if Earth is the only place where people live

it's actually the least lonely place in the universe

There are plenty of people to be loved by

and plenty of people to love

We need each other

We know that now more than ever

Good night

When you have a job that pays you enough to cover your basic needs

your bills and even some more to spend

the assumption is that you'd be happy

or even better fulfilled

And it seems unthinkable when you wake up and say

you're going to leave a job like that to pursue a passion

And that was my dilemma six years ago

I had a comfortable job I lived a comfortable life

and people expected me to be fulfilled

but I wasn't

There was something in me that wanted more

There was a misalignment between the things I did on a daily basis

and the things that I deeply cared about

And so I decided to quit

and explore the possibility of bringing this passion into my daily routine

And the thing about finding your passion

is that it's not straightforward

Even for people with money and degrees

they still struggle to identify their passion

And here I was as a yearold

talking about finding my passion

and turning it into a career

Literally people told me

You don't talk about passion until you've made enough money 

Laughter

or at least until you're ready to retire

Because there's a notion that looking inward

and finding the things that give us pleasure and fulfillment

is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy

or a pleasure that only the retired can indulge in

Which made me wonder

Is passion only for the rich

or an experience only the retired can enjoy

For many of us we've been led to believe

that life is a race of survival

We've been conditioned to see ourselves as survivors

that must do everything in our power to survive

In Africa we're nurtured to go through school cram and pass

in the hope that you get a job after

And if you do stick at it no matter how much it sucks

Laughter

Until you get a better offer or you're asked to retire

And as a dropout

I knew that I was not entitled to anything

Every opportunity was a privilege

And so when I thought about quitting

it was a huge risk

I was given two alternatives

which are the most popular in Africa

The first one is sign up for any course at a vocational institution and do it

My second option settle for any job offer you can get

no matter the working conditions

and do it

That probably explains why we have so many of our young people

being trafficked in search of greener pastures

I opted for the first option

I did look at a couple vocational institutions

in the hope that I would find a course that resonated with my persona

my dream and my aspiration

I was disappointed to learn that there was no room for misfits like me

in these institutions

The education system in many parts of the world

has been designed around preselected options

that young people are expected to fit in or risk becoming misfits

And so going through school I was nurtured and conditioned

to think in the straight line and stay within the straight line

But when I dropped out I discovered a world of possibilities

I knew I could be anything I could study anything

and so I leveraged free online courses

That's how I built my CV got into employment

and worked for eight years

And after eight years

I told myself there must be more to life

than just going through the routines of life

So in  I started an organization called Kyusa
Kyusa
where we are working with outofschool youth

and empowering them to turn their passions

into profitable scalable and sustainable businesses

Now when we talk about passion

one of the most common questions that people ask is What is passion

How do I even find it

And in the simplest definition

passion is a collection of your life experiences

that give you the deepest sense of fulfillment

And to identify your passion you need to look inward

So we use two reflective questions

The first question we ask is

If you had all the time and the money in the world

what would you spend your time doing

It sounds like a very simple question

but many people struggle to answer this question

because they've just never thought about it

The second question we ask

is What makes you happy

or gives you the deepest sense of fulfillment

Now you would assume that we all know what makes us happy

but it's also interesting to note that so many people have no idea

what makes them happy

because they are so busy going through the routines of life

they've never stopped to look inward

And so identifying the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment

and the things that give us deep joy

are thoughts that begin to direct us in the direction of our passion

And just in case you're wondering

what your answers are to those two questions

I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it

However I am also aware

that passion alone cannot guarantee success in life

And I should note

that not every passion can become a career

For passion to become a career

it must be coupled with the right set of skills conditioning and positioning

So when we get our young people to look inward

we also ask them what skills do you have

what talents do you have what experience do you have

that you can use to build a niche in the marketplace

But more than that we also look at the market trends

because it doesn't matter how much you love and enjoy it

If nobody wants it or is willing to pay for it

it can't be a career

It's just a hobby

And the third thing we look at is how do you position yourself

Who are you targeting Who do you want to sell to

Why would they want to buy from you

And so the combination of the three is what enables you to move

from just a passion to a business

And many of our young people have been able to turn their ideas

and burning desires into profitable businesses

or social enterprises

and they're not just creating jobs

but they are solving societal challenges

I'll share with you two examples

One of them is Esther

I met Esther two years ago

She had been out of school for two years

and she had been deeply affected by her dropping out

As a result she had experienced severe depression

to a point where she attempted to take her own life several times

Her friends and family didn't know what to do for her

They simply prayed for her

When I met Esther and I started to converse with her

I asked her a simple question

I said If you had all the time and the money in the world

what would you do

Without thinking or hesitation

her eyes lit up and she began to tell me

how she wanted to change the lives of young people

She wanted to restore hope and dignity to other teenagers

by helping them make informed decisions about life

I was certain of the fact that this burning desire in her

was unquenchable

And so we worked with Esther to put a framework around this desire
Esther
Today she runs a social enterprise in her village

raising awareness about substance abuse mental health sexual reproductive health

and is helping other school dropouts acquire vocational skills

so they can make a living for themselves

Esther turned  this year

and for the last two years she has organized an annual teen fest

that brings together over  teenagers

Applause

Young people that are able to network and collaborate

on different projects

but more importantly to meet professionals they would otherwise never have met

This is all engineered by a girl that believed the world had no room for her

that without education she would never amount to anything

But by looking inward and tapping into a burning desire

putting structure around it

it has become a model that not only changed her life

but is transforming the lives of hundreds of young people every year

My other example is Musa
Musa
Musa is a natural artistic guy
Musa
He's the kind that would look at any design and replicate it with ease

And so he seeks to recognize that ability in him

When I met Musa he was doing all kinds of crafts 
Musa
bags belts wallets 

but it was more of a parttime thing

Or sometimes if he was really broke and needed to make quick money

then he would come up with a design and sell it

But he had never thought of it as a business

We started working with Musa
Musa
helping him shift his mindset from a hobby to a business

and beginning to rethink how he can make products that he could sell

and even be able to scale

Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I've ever seen
Musa
and over the last one year Musa's business has grown
Musa
He has been recognized in different places

Currently he's talking about exporting to developed countries

Musa like any other dropout
Musa
believed that without academic credentials

he wouldn't amount to anything

He thought the talent he had was nothing

simply because he did not have an academic paper to define him

But by looking inward and finding that what he had was the greatest asset

and supporting him to turn it into a business

he's not just living  he's thriving

The thing about looking inward is that it can be scary

especially if you're doing it for the first time

But the truth is you never truly start living

until you learn to live from the inside out

And in unlocking potential we need to look inward to identify

the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment

the things that give us the deepest joy

and then weave them into the patterns of our daily routines

In so doing we cease to work and we start to live

And the thing about living is that you never have to retire or to resign

Laughter

Applause

And so as you think about unlocking potential for ourselves

for our young people for our children

let's not condition them to look outward

but condition them to look inward

to tap into who they are and bring that self into what they do every day

When you cease to work and you live

when passion becomes a career

you don't just excel

you become unstoppable

Thank you

Applause

I guess all of you have a smartphone or an iPhone
iPhone
and this morning probably you checked on the weather
And this morning probably you checked on the weather
if its going to be rainy to carry your umbrella

if it is going to be sunny to use your sunglasses

or if it is going to be cold to have an extra coat

It's going to give you sometime good information and sometime not

Let me tell you

my best app is my grandmother

Laughter

She's called Mamadda
Mamadda
She can tell you not only today's weather

but she can predict the next  months

if it's going to be a good rain season or not

She can tell you just by observing her environment

by observing the wind direction

the cloud position

the bird migration

the size of fruits

the plant flowers

She can tell you by observing the behavior of her own cattle

That's how she knows better the weather and the ecosystem

that she's living in

I'm coming from a pastoralist community

who are cattle herders

We are nomadic

We move from one place to another one

to find water and pasture

We can move up to a thousand kilometers the size of California within one year

And this life helps us to live in harmony with our ecosystem

We understand each other

For us the nature is our supermarket

where we can collect our food

our water

It's our pharmacy where we can collect our medicinal plants

But it's our school

where we can learn better how to protect it

and how it can give us back what we need

But with the climate change impact

we are experiencing a different impact

In my community

we have one of the top five fresh waters in Africa

It's Lake Chad

When my mother was born

Lake Chad used to be about  kilometers square of water

When I was born  years ago it was  kilometers square

And actually now

it's about  kilometers square of water

Ninety percent of this water just evaporated disappeared

And you have more than  million people

living around this lake and depending on it

They are pastoralists

They are fishermen

And they are farmers

They do not depend on the end of the month's salary

They depend on the rainfall

They depend on the crops that are growing

or the pasture for their cattle

The shrinking resources

you have many communities that are fighting to get access

The first come is the first served

The second have to fight unto death

So climate change is impacting our environment

by changing our social life

because the role of man and woman in this region it's different

Man is supposed to feed his family

take care of his community

and if he cannot do that

his dignity is under threat

He cannot do anything else to pay it back

So climate change takes our men far away from us

That is the migration

They can migrate to a big city where they can stay for six or  months

where they get a job they can send back money

If they didn't get it

they have to jump into the Mediterranean

and migrate to Europe

Some of them die there but none of them stop going

Of course it's sad for the hosting country

who are developed countries

who have to adapt to host the migrants coming

But how about those who are left behind

the women and the children who have to play the role of men

the role of women

who have to take care of the security

of the food of the health of the entire family

children and old people

So those women for me they are my heroes

because they are innovators they are solution makers

they are changing the little of the resources

into the big for the community

So those are my people

So we use our indigenous people's traditional knowledge

to get better resilience to what we need to survive

Our knowledge is not only for our communities

It's to share with each and others who are living with us

And indigenous peoples around the world

are saving  percent of the world's biodiversity

That's the scientists who say that

Indigenous peoples in the Amazon

you can find the most diverse ecosystem better than the national park

The indigenous peoples from the Pacific

the grandma and the grandpa

they know where to get food after the hurricane hits them

So the knowledge that our peoples know

is helping us to survive and helping other peoples also to survive

the climate change impact

The world is losing

We lost already  percent of the species

and it's increasing every day

So one day I took a scientist to my community

I said you are giving the good weather information through the TV and radio

but how about coming to my people

And then they come

they sit around

and suddenly as we are nomadic we just start packing our stuff

and then they say like Are we moving

I'm like No we are not moving It's going to rain

And they're like Oh there's no cloud How do you know it's going to rain

We're like Yeah it's going to rain We pack our stuff

Suddenly heavy rain starts coming

and we are seeing the scientist running around hiding under trees

and protecting their stuff

We already packed ours

Laughter

After the end of the rain the serious discussion starts

They say How do you know that it's going to rain

We say Well the old woman observed the insects

taking the eggs inside their homes

and while the insect cannot talk or watch TV

they know how to predict to protect their generations

how to protect their food

So for us it's the sign that it's going to rain

in at maximum a couple of hours

And then they say

well we do have knowledge

but we do not combine ecological knowledge and weather knowledge all together

So that's how I started working

with meteorological scientists and my communities

to give better information to get peoples adapted to climate change

I think if we put together all the knowledge systems that we have 

science technology

traditional knowledge 

we can give the best of us to protect our peoples

to protect our planet

to restore the ecosystem that we are losing

I did that in another way also

I used a tool that I really love a lot

It's called a D participatory mapping
D
participatory because it can bring women men

youth elders

all the intergenerational peoples

Then they use sciencebased knowledge

and the community comes together they build this map

they figure out all the knowledge that we have

about where is our sacred forest where is our water point

where is our corridor

where is the place that we move during each season

And these tools are amazing because it's building capacity of women

because in our communities

women and men cannot sit together

Men talk always women just sitting there

but in the back

They are not there to take any decision

So after the men figure out all the knowledge

we say well you call the women Come and have a look

They say Yes sure

because they've already done the first work

Laughter

When the women come

and they look at the map they're like Mm no

Laughter

This is wrong

Here's where I collect the medicine Here's where I collect the food

Here's where I collect 

So we changed the knowledge in the map

and we called the men

Well they think about what women say

All of them shaking their heads

They are right They are right

They are right

So that's how we build the capacity of the women

in giving them a voice

in this D participatory mapping
In this D participatory mapping
so women get the detailed knowledge

that can help the community to adapt

And man have the bigger picture knowledge

So when we put it together

this map helps them to discuss

but to mitigate the conflict between the communities

to access the resources

to share better these resources

to restore it

and to manage it for the long term

Our knowledge is very useful

Indigenous peoples' knowledge

are very crucial for our planet

It's crucial for all the peoples

Science knowledge was discovered  years ago

technology  years ago

but indigenous peoples' knowledge it's thousands of years ago

So why we cannot put all of these together

combine those three knowledges

and give the better resilience

to the peoples who are getting the impact of climate change

And now it's not only the developing countries

It's the developed countries also

We saw the hurricane We saw the flood around all the places

We saw the fire even here in California

So we need all this knowledge to come together

We need the people in the center

And we need the decision makers to change

scientists tell them

and we tell them

and we do have this knowledge

We have  years to change it

Ten years is nothing

so we need to act all together

and we need to act right now

Thank you

Applause

Would you ever forgive a person who kills a member of your family

In September of 

Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced for murder

and then the brother of the victim

forgave her

Brandt Jean was  years old
Brandt Jean
and I joined the rest of the country watching on television in awe

at that act of grace

But I also worried

I worried that people who are African American like Brandt Jean
Brandt Jean
are expected to forgive more often than other people

And I worried that a white police officer like Amber Guyger
Amber Guyger
receives a lesser sentence

than other people who commit wrongful killings

But because I'm a law professor

I also worried about the law itself

The law leans so severely towards punishment these days

that it's part of the problem

And that's what I want to talk about here

The powerful example of one individual's forgiveness

makes me worry that lawyers and officials too often overlook the tools

that law itself creates to allow forgiveness

when the principle should be the cornerstone of a thriving society

I worry that lawyers and officials do not adequately use the tools of forgiveness

by which I mean letting go of justified grievance

And those tools are many

They include pardons commutations expungement

bankruptcy for debt

and the discretion that's held by police and prosecutors and judges

But I also worry  I worry a lot 

Laughter

I worry that these tools when used replicate the disparities

the inequities along the lines of race and class and other markers

of advantage and disadvantage

Biases or privileged access are at work

when United States presidents pardon people charged with crimes

Historically white people are pardoned four times as often

as members of minority groups for the same crime same sentence

Forgiveness between individuals is supported by every religious tradition

every philosophic tradition

And medical evidence now shows

the health benefits of letting go of grievances and resentments

As Nelson Mandela led South Africa's transition
Nelson Mandela
from apartheid to democracy

he explained

Resentment is like drinking a poison and hoping it will kill your enemies

Law can remove the penalties for those who apologize and seek forgiveness

For example in  states in the United States

and the District of Columbia

there are laws that allow medical professionals to apologize

when something goes wrong

and not fear that that statement could later be used against them

in an action for damages

More actively bankruptcy law offers debtors under some conditions

the chance to start anew

Pardons and expungements sealing criminal records can too

I have been teaching law for almost  years hard to believe

but recently I realized

that we don't teach law students about the tools of forgiveness

that are within the legal system

and nor do law schools usually explore

the potential for new avenues for forgiveness

that law can adopt or assist

These are lost opportunities

These are lost obligations even

because the students that I teach

will become prosecutors judges governors presidents

Barack Obama my former student
Barack Obama
used his power as the President of the United States to give pardons

That released several hundred people from prison after the law changed

to provide shorter sentences for the same drug crimes

for which they had been convicted

But if he hadn't used his pardon power they would still be in prison

Legal tools of forgiveness should be used more

but not without reason and not with bias

A New Yorker cartoon shows a judge with a big nose and a big mustache

looking down at a defendant with the exact same nose

and exact same mustache

and says Obviously not guilty

Laughter

Forgiveness could undermine the commitment that law has

to treat people the same under the same circumstances

to apply rules evenly

In this age of resentment mass incarceration

widespread consumer debt

we need more forgiveness but we need a philosophy of forgiveness

We need to forgive fairly

Contrast the treatment globally of child soldiers

with the treatment of juvenile offenders in the United States

International human rights condemn and punish adults

who involve children in armed conflict

as those most responsible

but treat the children themselves quite differently

The International Criminal Court

now with  member nations

convicted Thomas Lubanga warlord in the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo
Thomas Lubanga
for enlisting recruiting and deploying children teens as soldiers

Many nations commit to ensuring that people under the age of 

do not become child soldiers

and most nations treat those who do become soldiers

not as objects of punishment

but as people deserving a fresh start

Compare and contrast how the United States treats juvenile offenders

where we severely punish minors

often moving them to adult courts even adult prisons

And yet like child soldiers

teens and children are drawn into violent activity in the United States

when there are few options

when they are threatened

or when adults induce them with money or ideology

The rhetoric of innocence is resonant when we talk about child soldiers

but not when we talk about teen gang members in the United States

Yet in both settings youth are caught in worlds that are made by adults

and forgiveness can offer both accountability and fresh starts

What if instead young people caught in criminal activity and violence

could have chances to accept responsibility

while learning and rebuilding their lives and their own communities

Legal frameworks inviting youth to describe their conduct

could also involve community members to hear and forgive
Called restorative justice

such efforts emphasize accountability and service

rather than punishment

Many schools in the United States have turned to use restorative justice methods

to resolve conflicts and to prevent them

and to disrupt the schooltoprison pipeline

Some American high schools have replaced automatic suspensions

with opportunities for victims to narrate their experiences

and for offenders to take responsibility for their actions

As they describe their experiences and feelings about a theft

or hateful graffiti or a verbal or physical assault

the victims and offenders often express strong emotions

And other members of the community take turns

describing the impact of the offense on them

The leader is often a student peer who is trained to deescalate the conflict

and orchestrate a conversation about what the offender can do

that would help the victim

Together they come to an agreement about how to move forward

what the wrongdoer can do to repair the injury

and what all could do to better avoid future conflicts

Consider this example recently in a publication

A young woman named Mercedes M transferred in California
M
from one high school to another

after she was so repeatedly suspended in her old high school

for getting into fights

And here in her new high school

two other young women accused her of lying

and called her the bword
b
A counselor came over and talked to her and earned enough trust

that she acknowledged she had stolen the shoes of one of the other classmates

Turns out the three of them had known each other for a long time

and they didn't know any other way to deal with each other

other than to fight

The facilitator invited them to participate in a circle

a confidential conversation about what happened

and they agreed

And initially each of them expressed a lot of emotion

And then Mercedes apologized

And she said she had stolen the shoes

but she did so because she wanted to sell them

and take the money to pay for a drug test

so that her mother could show she was clean

and try to regain custody of two younger children

who were then in state protective care

The other girls heard this

saw Mercedes crying

and they hugged her

They did not ask her to return what she'd stolen

but they did say they wanted a restart

They wanted a reason they could trust her

Later Mercedes explained

that she was sure she would have been suspended

if they hadn't had this process

And her high school has reduced suspensions by more than half

through the use of this kind of restorative justice method

Restorative justice alternatives involve offenders and victims

in communicating in ways

that an adversarial and defensive process does not allow

and it's become the goto method

in places like the District of Columbia juvenile justice system

and innovations like Los Angeles's Teen Court
Teen Court
If tuned to fairness

forgiveness methods like bankruptcy would be available

not only for the forprofit college that goes bellyup

but also for the students stuck with the loans

pardons would not be given to campaign contributors

and black men would no longer have  percent longer criminal sentences

than do white men

due to how judges exercise discretion

Forgiveness across the board is one way to avoid such biases

Sometimes a society just needs a reset

when it comes to punishment and debt

The Bible calls for periodic forgiveness of debts

and freeing prisoners

and it recently helped to inspire a global movement

Jubilee  joined Pope John Paul II

and rock star Bono and over  nations
Bono
in an effort to seek the cancellation and succeed in canceling

the debt of developing countries

amounting to over  billion dollars

of debt canceled

resulting in measurable reduction in poverty

In a similar spirit there are people who are copying the techniques

of commercial debt collectors

who purchase debt for pennies on the dollar

and then seek to enforce it

Latenight television host John Oliver partnered with a nonprofit group
John Oliver
called RIP Medical Debt
RIP
and for only  dollars

they purchased  million dollars' worth of medical debt

and then they forgave it

Applause

That allowed nearly  people to have a restart in their lives

This kind of precedent should trigger and encourage more such actions

It's time for a reset

given mass incarceration

medical and consumer debt

and given indigent criminal defendants

who are charged and put in debt

because they're expected to pay for their own probation officers

and their own electronic monitors

Forgiving violations of law

or promises to pay back loans

does pose risks

Forgiveness may encourage more violations

Economists even have a name for it

They call it moral hazard

Should there be amnesty for immigration violations

Should a president offer pardons to protect himself

or to induce lawbreaking

These are tough questions for our time

But escalating resentments hold their own dangers

So does attributing blame to individuals

for circumstances largely outside their own control

To ask how law may forgive is not to deny the fact of wrongdoing

Rather it's to widen the lens

to enable glimpses of the larger patterns

and to enable new choices that can go forward

if we can wipe the slate clean

Thank you

Applause

Hi there

I'm in the habit of saying I would like it if butterflies could talk

but I've been recently reconsidering that

because we already have a pretty loud world

Can you imagine if butterflies were yakking out there all over the place

But I would like to ask butterflies one question which is

what is the meaning of some of the stories that we humans tell about them

Because remarkably all over the world cultures have really similar stories

similar mythologies about butterflies having to do with the human soul

Some cultures tell us butterflies are carrying the souls of children

who have died wrongly or too soon

and other cultures tell us that butterflies

are carrying the souls of our ancestors among us

This butterfly is called a Kallima inachus
Kallima inachus
On one side it looks like a beautiful butterfly

and on the other side it looks like a leaf

and it folds up like a leaf to elude predators

So now you see it now you don't

something hidden something revealed

Maybe we got our ideas about the human soul from this butterfly

So it's possible that butterflies have some sort of outsized role

in our afterlife

But in this life in this world butterflies are in really serious trouble

This is a moth

Moths and butterflies are related Moths generally fly at night

This is called praedicta because Darwin predicted that it must exist
 praedicta
So today more than  species of butterflies are endangered

around the world

but even more than that

insects are declining declining declining

In the last  years

we've lost nearly  percent of the total number of bodies of insects

Now this is a disaster

It could impact us in a more serious way more quickly than climate change

because butterflies don't do that much in the ecosystem that we depend on

but they do things for other creatures that we do depend on

and that's the same story with all insect life

Insect life is at the very foundation of our lifesupport systems

We can't lose these insects

Biodiversity all over the globe is in a vast decline

Habitat loss pesticides herbicides and impacts of climate change

Habitat loss is very serious

and that's where we really have to get developing better

more mindfully

It's the worst of times

we are kind of overloaded with our problems

It's also the best of times  there's incredibly good news

We have exactly what we need

We have exactly the platform to save nature

It's called citizen science

So citizen science is generally a term used to mean people without a PhD

contributing to scientific research

Sometimes it's called community science

which gets at the communal purpose of citizen science

which is to do something for our commons together

It's amateur science

It's being turbocharged today by vast computing power

statistical analysis and the smartphone

but it's an ancient practice that people have always practiced

It's amateur science

Professional science has its roots in amateur science

Charles Darwin was a citizen scientist
Charles Darwin
He had no advanced degree and he worked only for himself

So someone showed Darwin this Madagascar star orchid

which as a spur that's  inches long

and the spur is the part of a flower that the nectar is in

So this person showed this to Darwin and said

This proves that evolution does not come about in a natural way

This flower proves that only God can make these incredibly bizarre

and trickylooking creatures on the earth

because no insect could possibly pollinate this

God must reproduce it

And Darwin said No I'm sure that there is an insect somewhere

with a proboscis long enough to pollinate that star orchid

And he was right

This is a map of the monarch butterfly

So the monarch butterfly has a different story

than that particular moth

but reflects the same kind of fundamental idea that Darwin had

called coevolution

and coevolution is at the heart of how nature works

and it's also at the heart of what's going wrong with nature today

So over time as the moth developed a longer proboscis

so the plant developed a longer spur

Over millions of years

the plant and the moth developed a relationship

whereby they both make each other's chances of existence better

The monarch butterfly has a different kind of coevolutionary relationship

and today it is at the heart of what's going wrong

for the monarch butterfly

So this is a map of the monarch butterfly migration

The monarch does this amazing thing

and over the course of a year

it goes over the entirety of North America

It does this in four or five generations

The first generations only live a couple of weeks

They mate they lay eggs and they die

The next generation emerges as butterflies and takes the next leg of the journey

Nobody knows how they do it

By the time the fifth generation comes back around  and that one lives longer

they overwinter in Mexico and California 

by the time it gets there

those butterflies are going back to where their ancestors came from

but they've never been there before

and nobody that they're immediately related to has been there before either

We don't know how they do it

The reason we know they do this kind of migration 

and we still have a lot of unanswered questions

about the monarch migration 

is because of citizen science

So for decades people have made observations

about monarch butterflies where and when they see them

and they've contributed these observations to platforms like Journey North
Journey North
This is a map of some observations of butterflies given to Journey North

And if you can see the dots are coded

by what time of year those observations were made

So these massive amounts of data come into a place like Journey North
Journey North
and they can create a map of this time of over a course of a year

of where monarchs go

Also because of citizen science

we understand that monarch butterfly numbers are going down down down

So in the s the overwintering butterflies here in California

there were four million counted

Last year 

Audience gasps

Four million to  since the s

The monarchs on the east coast are doing a little better

but they're also going down

OK so what are we going to do about it

Well very organically nobody really asking anybody to do it

people all over the continent are supporting monarch butterflies

The heart of the problem for monarchs is milkweed

It's another coevolutionary relationship and here's the story

Milkweed is toxic

It has a poison in it that it evolved to deter other insects from eating it

but the monarch developed a different kind of relationship

a different strategy with the milkweed

Not only does it tolerate the toxin

the monarch actually sequesters the toxin in its body

thus becoming poisonous to its predators

Monarch butterflies will only lay their eggs on milkweed

and monarch caterpillars will only eat milkweed

because they need that toxin to actually create what they are as a species

So people are planting milkweed all over the country

where we have lost milkweed due to habitat destruction

pesticide use herbicide use and climate change impacts

You can create a lot of butterfly habitat and pollinator habitat on a windowsill

You go to a native nursery in your area

and find out what's native to where you live

and you will bring beautiful things to yourself

Now citizen science can do even more than rescue monarch butterflies

It has the capacity to scale

to the level necessary that we need to mobilize to save nature

And this is an example

It's called City Nature Challenge

and City Nature Challenge is a project of the California Academy of Sciences

and the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History

So for four years City Nature Challenge has enjoined cities all over the globe

to participate in counting up biodiversity in their cities

We're up to like a million observations of biodiversity

collected by people around the globe this past April

The winner this year was South Africa much to the chagrin of San Francisco

Laughter

Look at them they have more biodiversity than we do

It's kind of an interesting thing what is revealed when you start seeing

what are the natural resources where you live

because as we go forward you want to live where there's more biodiversity

And by the way citizen science is a very good tool for social justice

and environmental justice goals for helping reach them

You need to have data and you need to show a picture

you need to point to a cause

and then you need to have the surgical strike

to help support whatever that problem is

So City Nature Challenge I think should get a commendation from the UN

Has there ever been a global effort on behalf of nature

undertaken in this coordinated manner

It's amazing it's fantastic

and it's really a pretty grassroots thing

and we get very interesting information about butterflies and other creatures

when we do these bioblitzes

City Nature Challenge basically works with a tool called iNaturalist
iNaturalist
and iNaturalist is your entry drug to citizen science Laughs
INaturalist 
I suggest signing up for it on a laptop or on a desktop

and then you put the app on your phone

With iNaturalist you take a picture of a bird a bug a snake anything
iNaturalist
and an artificial intelligence function and an expert vetting system

works to verify that observation

The app gives the observation the date the time the latitude and the longitude

geolocates that observation

That's the data that's the science of citizen science

And then that data is shared

and that sharing that is the soul of citizen science

When we share data

we can see much bigger pictures of what's going on

There's no way to see that whole monarch migration

without sharing data that's been collected over decades

seeing the heart and soul of how nature works

through citizen science

This is a Xerces blue butterfly

which went extinct when it lost its habitat in Golden Gate Park

It had a coevolutionary relationship with an ant and that's another story

Laughter

I'll end by asking you

please participate in citizen science in some way shape or form

It is an amazingly positive thing

It takes an army of people to make it really work

And I'll just add that I think butterflies

probably really do have enough on their plate

without carrying around human souls

Laughter

But there's a lot we don't know right

And what about all those stories What are those stories telling us

Maybe we coevolved our souls with butterflies

Certainly we are connected to butterflies in deeper ways than we currently know

and the mystery of the butterfly will never be revealed

if we don't save them

So please join me in helping to save nature now

Thank you

Autism is something that many people know about

For example some people think

that autistic people are fairskinned males

that speak in monotone

and constantly go on and on about the same topic

Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong

avoid attention

and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time

Some people think that autistic people are socially awkward

and lack humor and empathy

Now if you agree with what I just said

I'm sorry to tell you

but you do not have the right impression of autism

How do I know

Because I have autism

I do have my own obsessions with things like electronics

and public transit

but that does not define me

Each of us are different and unique in our own way

However there is not a lot of information out there

on what an autistic life actually looks like

so people often resort to stereotypes

And we see these often in the media

Some of the more common stereotypes in the media

include being socially awkward

lacking empathy

and even being a supergenius

And the lack of knowledge on autism doesn't stop there either

Did you know that some people are trying to find a cure for autism

That's because they see it as a negative thing

as a disease

Many people are challenging the idea

and to us we think autism is not a disease

It's just another way of thinking and looking at the world

Our brains function differently from most people's brains

Think of it like comparing and Xbox and a PlayStation
XboxPlayStation
They're both highly capable consoles with different programming

But if you put your Xbox game in a PlayStation
XboxPlayStation
it won't work because the PlayStation communicates differently
PlayStation
When I look in the mirror

I see someone who thinks differently

Oh and I also see nice hair

Laughter

Applause

But the question is

am I really diseased if I just think differently

The main problem with living autistic in today's society

is that the world just isn't built for us

There's so many ways that we can get overwhelmed

For example

the thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noises

which means I never crank up my music really loud

and I usually am not a fan of large parties

But other people on the spectrum might get overwhelmed

with things like bright lights or strong smells

or gooey textures

that all have the potential to create anxiety

Think about all of the social gatherings you've been to in the past

Was there loud music playing

Were there really bright lights

Were there lots of different food smells going on at the same time

Were there lots of conversations happening all at once

Those things may not have bothered you guys

but for someone with autism

they can be quite overwhelming

So in those situations we do something called stimming

which is like a repetitive motion or a noise

or some other random fidgeting that may or may not seem normal

Some people will flap their arms

or make a noise or spin

Ya it's basically our way of zoning out

It can often feel necessary for us to stim

However it's often frowned upon

and we're forced to hide it

When we're forced to hide our autistic traits like this

it's called masking

And some people mask better than others

I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic

until I give them the big reveal Laughs
 
But at the end of the day it gets really stressful

Even something like doing my homework at night

becomes very tiring

Some people think

because of our ability to mask

that this is the cure to autism

However all it really does is makes us ashamed

of showing our true selves

Another common stereotype that is often associated with autism

is that autistic people lack empathy

And again this is not true

I actually have lots of empathy

I'm just not really good at showing it

Whenever a friend is trying to tell me

some of the struggles that they're going through

I often don't know how to express my reply

And that is why I don't show as much empathy

as my nonautistic friends do

Emotional expression however much or however little

is difficult for me

And that is because I am bursting inside

with every single emotion one feels at all times

Though of course I cannot express it that way

Otherwise let's say happiness for example

would come out as a huge burst of gleeful wheezing

hand flapping and loud vocal woohoos

Laughter

Whereas you may just smile

Laughter

Whether it be receiving an awesome birthday gift

or listening to a tragic story on the news

I cannot really express my reply without bursting

so once again I have to mask it in order to appear normal

My inner feelings are unlimited

but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing

So my 
 
I am not great with my emotions

and I communicate differently

and because of that I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder

This diagnosis helps me and my friends and family

to know how my mind works

And in the world

approximately one percent of the population

is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder

And this number is growing

However we are still a big minority

And there's still lots of people that do not see us as equals

to other people

This is my family

And in my family

there is one other person who is also autistic

My mother

Yes adult women can also be autistic

My dad and my brother are both nonautistic

Sometimes it can be a bit difficult for us to communicate with each other

however

Sometimes I'll say something like

Oh Toronto's Union Station right

thinking that I can

help them to remember certain aspects of it

When they get confused I often have to elaborate myself on that

And we often have to say things

in a number of different ways so that everyone understands

However despite all that

we all love each other and respect each other as equals

In his book NeuroTribes

author Steve Silberman states that autism and other mental conditions
Steve Silberman
should be seen as naturally human

naturally part of a human spectrum

and not as defects

And this is something that I agree to completely

If autism was seen as part of a natural human spectrum

then the world could be designed to work better for autistic people

I am not ashamed of my autism

And I may not think like you

or act like you

but I am still human and I am not diseased

Thank you

Applause

Humankind loves to build walls

Have you ever noticed that

We build walls for everything

for shelter for protection for privacy

Over the past  years

the number of barriers between countries has doubled

Right now there are more walls than at the end of the Second World War

more than during the Cold War

Growing up in Germany

the fall of the Berlin Wall always felt to me

like the introduction of a new world a world without barriers

But since the attacks of 

the construction has experienced an extreme rise

Since then the amount has doubled

with about  new structures that were planned or built

Walls and fences are often built with the intention of security

security from another group of people

from crime from illegal trades

But walls and fences only provide us with a feeling of security

which is different from real security

Even though they might make us feel safe

the structures themselves can't protect us

Instead they do something else

they separate

They create an us and a them

They establish an enemy

Walls make us build a second wall in our head a mental wall

And those mental walls slowly make us lose sight

of all the things we have in common with the people on the other side

The other way around

mental walls can grow so strong that they encourage us to build

keep or strengthen physical walls

Physical and mental walls are closely interlinked

and one almost always comes with the other

It's a constant cycle

physical walls empower mental walls and mental walls empower physical walls

until at one point one part falls away

and the cycle is disrupted

When the Berlin Wall was being built

it was hard to tell who the wall was facing

because the people living around it identified as one

There was no us and them

There was no others

During the time of separation

both sides developed differently and formed individual identities

All of a sudden there was an us and a them

A mental wall was built

and when the Berlin Wall fell again in 

this mental wall in the head of the people stayed

Eastern Germans had to be reintegrated into their own country

and even though they didn't have to move places

many still today feel like they have never fully arrived

Those remaining effects of the mental wall are also measurable

A study from the Freie University of Berlin in 

shows that even  years after the reunification

Germans still believed that cities on the other side of the former wall

are further away than they really are

The interesting thing is that they found a link between political attitude

and estimation of the distance

The more a participant was against the German reunification

the further away they estimated cities to be

It's the mental wall which keeps cities on the other side far away

and the higher and stronger this mental wall

the more difficult they seem to be reached

I tried to repeat this study

with a group of young Germans who grew up without the wall

to see if these effects are still measurable nowadays

And the results show that this generation

my generation

is just kind of bad at geography in general 

Laughter

East and West

But in our defense this could be seen as an improvement right

We never experienced the actual wall

This physical barrier was never able to make us build a mental wall

in the first place

I would love to take this as a serious indication

that there could be a future without a mental wall dividing Germany

but I think we have to face reality

this one wall could be disappearing

but in the meanwhile a billion others are constructed

One global trend we are currently experiencing

is the rise of gated communities

And in a way gated communities can be seen the same exact way as countries

just on the small scale 

neighborhoods surrounded by walls and fences

to protect citizens from other citizens 

and the only difference is it's by choice

But the physical and mental effects on the people living inside

and the people kept outside

are the same

separating cities neighborhoods

and even playgrounds

In the spring of last year I worked on a design project in Brussels

at two elementary schools where this was the case

Both the schools share an entrance and the schoolyard

Both schools teach in Dutch

But one school is mainly visited by Belgian children

and the other school by immigrant children

The schools are separated by walls and fences

leaving the children no point of interaction

other than this fence on the schoolyard that separates them

When I started to work there

it made me sad to see children having to stand at a fence

to talk to their friend on the other side

But what's even worse is that most of the children

will never get the opportunity to even make a friend on the other side

School should be the place where children all children

come together and learn 

learn from the teacher but more importantly

learn from each other

And the more diversity the more there is to learn

In fact school might be the only time in our lives

where establishing a contact despite social differences is even possible

Separating children during this time of their development

will make integration extremely difficult

if not impossible

And yet somehow

I seem to be the only one having a problem with this fence in Brussels

Most of the parents teachers and children

stopped seeing or at least questioning the structure

It's just how it is

Nobody has ever seen it differently

And people are in favor of it

I once asked a boy if he would like to play with the other side

and he said No

Then I asked if he would play with them if the fence wasn't there

and he said Probably

But then he quickly added that the fence should stay

because the other side is mean and they never give back his ball

It's funny because I talked to children from both sides

and everyone told me that the other side is mean

because they never give back the ball

The children on both sides dislike each other

and there are regularly arguments breaking out at this fence

which is also the main reason why people feel the need

for it to be there

it protects the children from each other

or at least their toys

and it prevents chaos

At some point the children started to crawl beneath the fence

to get their ball back

and the reaction of the schools was to put these metal plates there

Now they climb over

I don't know what came first in Brussels

a mental wall that grew too strong that it made them build a physical fence

or this fence that now emphasizes the social differences

even on the schoolyard

But what I did know when I started to work there

was that I wanted to change something about the situation

I wanted to show both sides again how much they have in common

For children this isn't very hard

because even though one schoolyard speaks Dutch

and the other schoolyard a mix of French Turkish and Arabic

they all speak the universal language of play

And it turned out the desire to play

is a lot stronger than all the supposed differences between them

I installed different games at the fence

which turned it into an interface a common ground

instead of a barrier

And all of a sudden children were drawing together

exchanging pencils

and talking on the phone

Especially the phones were a great success

because they were so amazed

by the fact that they can hear the other side through this device

that they couldn't stop speaking

In the case of an elementary school parents play a very big role

in shaping the everyday life and the environment of their children

So I knew that if I wanted to make a difference

I had to somehow show them too how much they have in common

with the other side

But for parents this was a lot more difficult

because most of them speak different languages

work different jobs with different incomes

live in different social circles

believe in different religions

experience different cultures

and share different values

And then there was me a student

different in all of these aspects again

So how could I show them

how much they have in common

I chose not to convince them myself

but by letting their own children do the talking

I designed a picture exhibition on the schoolyard

showing them their children playing together through the fence

At the end of this exhibition

I asked people to write down their thoughts ideas and wishes

on these big wooden boxes

and I labeled the boxes with What do you think

A lot of people wrote Yes on it

Yes what

I never mentioned my opinion or an action that should follow

so which question were they answering with yes

When I asked they said yes the fence should go

Yes we want to play with the other side

The pictures implied enough to answer a question

that was never proposed

People were seeing the absurdity of the situation again

and felt how unnecessary this fence is

without me forcing an opinion on them

The exhibition showed the two sides their similarities for once

That day there was no us and them

there was no others

The mental wall started to crumble

I chose the word crumbling

because breaking a mental wall is a long journey

and breaking a mental wall can be a lot more difficult

than simply tearing down the physical one

We have to challenge our opinion and beliefs

and maybe even admit our own wrongs

So what happened in Brussels was a big step

a step that has been taking generations in Germany

There are many examples from all over the world

telling the same story I experienced in Brussels and Germany

enough examples from which we could have learned

But still we seek walls as solutions for problems that they cannot solve

because walls don't fight the root of our problem

If anything they reduce the symptoms

So the next time you are planning to build a wall

or you are planning to support someone who wants to build a wall

I want you to remember the impact you are really having

Because this simple structure will hardly create more security

Instead it will affect the people living with it every day

people who despite the geographic border

often share a lot of culture and values

For them you are not building one wall but two

two walls which will take decades and generations to overcome again

Thank you

One morning  years ago

I stepped out of a New York City subway on a beautiful day in September

The sun was warm and bright the sky was a clear perfect blue

I had my sixmonthold son in one of those frontfacing baby carriers

you know so he could see everything

And when I turned right on Sixth Avenue

what he saw

was the World Trade Center on fire

As soon as I realized that this was an attack

the first thing I did without even really thinking about it

was to take my baby and turn him around in that carrier

I didn't want him to see what was going on

And I just remember feeling so grateful that he was still young enough

that I didn't have to tell him that someone had done this on purpose

 was like crossing a border

a hostile border into dangerous uncharted territory

The world was suddenly in this terrifying new place

and I was in this place as a new mother

I remember my thoughts kind of pingponging around

from How am I ever going to protect this baby

to How am I ever going to get some sleep

Well my son turned  this year

along with millions of other people who were babies on 

And in that time

we have all crossed into this hostile uncharted territory

of climate breakdown

of endless wars

of economic meltdowns

of deep political divisions

of the many crises around the world that I don't need to list off

because they are blaring at you every single day from your news feed

But there is something I've learned in these  years of parenting

and in my years leading a global women's rights organization

There is a way to face these big crises in the world

without feeling overwhelmed and despairing

It's simple and it's powerful

It's to think like a mother

Now to be clear you don't have to be a woman

or a parent to do this

Thinking like a mother is a lens that's available to everybody

The poet Alexis De Veaux writes

Motherhood is not simply the organic process of giving birth

It's an understanding of the needs of the world

Now it's easy to focus on all of the obstacles

to making this the world we want

greed inequality violence

Yes there is all of that

But there's also the option to plant a seed a different seed

and cultivate what you want to see grow

even in the midst of crisis

Majid from Iraq understands this

He is a housepainter by trade

and someone who believes deeply in equal rights for women

When ISIS invaded northern Iraq where he lives
ISIS
he worked with a local women's organization

to help build an underground railroad

an escape network for women's rights activists

and LGBTIQ folks who were targeted with assassination
LGBTIQ
And when I asked Majid why he risked his own life
Majid
to bring people to safety

he said to me

If we want a brighter future

we have to build it now in the dark times

so that one day we can live in the light

That's what social justice work is and that's what mothers do

We act in the present with an idea of the future

that we want to bring about

All of the best ideas seem impossible at first

But just in my lifetime

we've seen the end of apartheid

the affirmation that women's rights are human rights

marriage equality

the fall of dictators who ruled for decades

and so much more

All of these things seemed impossible

until people took action to make them happen

and then like almost right away

they seemed inevitable

When I was growing up

whether we were stuck in traffic or dealing with a family tragedy

my mother would say

Something good is going to happen we just don't know what it is yet

Now I will admit that my brothers and I make fun of her for this

but people ask me all the time

how I deal with the suffering that I see in my work

in refugee camps and disaster zones

and I think of my mom and that seed of possibility

that she planted in me

Because when you believe that something good is coming

and you're part of making it happen

you start to be able to see beyond the suffering

to how things could be

Today there is a new set of necessary ideas

that seem impossible but one day will feel inevitable

that we could end violence against women

make war a thing of the past

learn to live in balance with nature before it's too late

and make sure that everybody has what they need to thrive

Of course being able to picture a future like this is not the same thing

as knowing what to do to make it come about

but thinking like a mother can help with that too

A few years ago

East Africa was gripped by a famine

and women I know from Somalia

walked for days carrying their hungry children

in search of food and water

A quarter of a million people died

and half of them were babies and toddlers

And while this catastrophe unfolded

too much of the world looked away

But a group of women farmers in Sudan

including Fatima Ahmed  that's her holding the corn 
Fatima Ahmed
heard about what was happening

And they pooled together the extra money that they had from their harvest

and asked me to send it to those Somali mothers

Now these farmers could have decided that they didn't have the power to act

They were barely getting by themselves

some of them

They lived without electricity without furniture

But they overrode that

They did what mothers do

they saw themselves as the solution and they took action

You do it all the time if you have kids

You make major decisions about their health care

their education their emotional wellbeing

even if you're not a doctor or a teacher or a therapist

You recognize what your child needs

and you step up to provide it the best you can

Thinking like a mother means seeing the whole world

through the eyes of those who are responsible

for its most vulnerable people

And we're not used to thinking of subsistence farmers as philanthropists

but those women were practicing the root meaning of philanthropy

love for humanity

What's at the core of thinking like a mother shouldn't be a surprise

it's love

Because love is more than just an emotion

It's a capacity a verb

an endlessly renewable resource 

and not just in our private lives

We recognize hate in the public sphere

Right Hate speech hate crimes

But not love

What is love in the public sphere

Well Cornel West who is not a mother but thinks like one
Cornel West
says it best

Justice is what love looks like in public

And when we remember that every policy is an expression of social values

love stands out as that superstar value

the one best able to account for the most vulnerable among us

And when we position love as a kind of leading edge

in policy making

we get new answers to fundamental social questions

like What's the economy for

What is our commitment to those in the path of the hurricane

How do we greet those arriving to our borders

When you think like a mother

you prioritize the needs of the many

not the whims of the few

When you think like a mother

you don't build a seawall around beachfront property

because that would divert floodwaters

to communities that are still exposed

When you think like a mother

you don't try to prosecute someone

for leaving water for people crossing the desert

Because you know 

Applause

Because you know that migration

just like mothering

is an act of hope

Now not every mother thinks like a mother

When presented with a choice some of us have made the wrong one

hiding behind weapons or barbed wire or privilege

to deny the rest of the world

thinking they can see their way to safety in some kind of armed lifeboat

fueled by racism and xenophobia

Not every mother is a role model

but all of us have a choice

Are we going to jump on that armed lifeboat

or work together to build a mother ship that can carry everyone

You know how to build that mother ship

how to repair the world and ease the suffering

Think like a mother

Thinking like a mother is a tool we can all use

to build the world we want

Thank you

Applause

Till death do us part

When we get married we make vows

To love to honor

to forsake all others

Or as a friend of mine put it

Not to leave dirty socks all over the house

Laughter

We may fall short of some of our promises

some of the time

but one that will always hold true is that first one

Till death do us part

Because spouses are bound together by their decisions

in marriage and in divorce

So a mentor of mine once told me

You should always marry your second husband first

Laughter

What did that mean

It didn't mean that Mr Right is somehow waiting behind door number two

It meant that if you want to understand

what makes a marriage work

you should think about how a marriage ends

Divorce makes extremely explicit

what the tacit rules of marriage are

And everyone should understand those rules

because doing so can help us build better marriages from the beginning

I know it doesn't sound very romantic

but sometimes the things we do out of love

can be the very things that make it hard for that love to last

I am a familylaw professor

I have taught students

I've been an attorney

I'm a mediator

and I've also been divorced

And I'm now happily married to my actual second husband

Laughter

The reason that I think this is so important

is that I think everyone should be having some of these very painful conversations

that divorced people experience

These are painful conversations about what we contributed

what we owe

what we are willing to give

and what we give up

And also what's important to us

Those conversations should be happening in a good marriage

not after it is broken

Because when you wait until it's broken

it's too late

But if you have them early on

they can actually help build a better marriage

Three ideas that I want to put on the table

for you to consider

One sacrifice should be thought of as a fair exchange

Two there's no such thing as free childcare

And three what's yours probably becomes ours

So let me talk about each of these ideas

The first one

sacrifice should be a fair exchange

Take the example of Lisa and Andy

Lisa decides to go to medical school early in the marriage

and Andy works to support them
Andy
And Andy works night shifts in order to do that
Andy
and he also gives up a great job in another city

He does this out of love

But of course he also understands

that Lisa's degree will benefit them both in the end

But after a few years Andy becomes neglected and resentful

And he starts drinking heavily

And Lisa looks at her life and she looks at Andy and she thinks

This is not the bargain I wanted to make

A couple of years go by

she graduates from medical school

and she files for a divorce

So in my perfect world

some kind of marriage mediator would have been able to talk to them

before Lisa went to medical school

And at that point that mediator might have asked

How exactly does fair exchange work

What does it look like in your marriage

What are you willing to give and what are you willing to owe

So in a divorce

Lisa now probably is going to owe Andy financial support for years

And Andy 

no amount of financial support is going to make him feel compensated

for what he gave up

and the lost traction in his career

If the two of them had thought about their split early on

what might have gone differently

Well it's possible that Lisa would have decided

that she would take loans or work a parttime job

in order to support her own tuition

so that Andy wouldn't have had to bear the entire burden for that
Andy
And Andy might have decided to take that job in that other city
Andy
and maybe the two of them would have commuted for a couple of years

while Lisa finished her degree

So let's take another couple Emily and Deb

They live in a big city

they have two children they both work

Emily gets a job in a small town
Emily
and they decide to move there together

And Deb quits her job to look after the children fulltime
Deb
Deb leaves behind an extended family
Deb
her friends

and a job that she really liked

And in that small town Deb starts to feel isolated and lonely

And  years later Deb has an affair
Deb
and things fall apart

Now the marriage mediator who would have come in

before they moved and before Deb quit her job
Deb
might have asked them

What do your choices about childcare

do to the obligations you have to each other

How do they affect your relationship

Because you have to remember

that there is no such thing as free childcare

If the two of them had thought about their split beforehand

what would have gone differently

Well maybe Deb would have realized a little better
Deb
how much her family and her friends were important to her

precisely in what she was taking on

which is fulltime parenthood

Perhaps Emily

in weighing the excitement of the new job offer

might have also thought about what that would mean for the cost to Deb
Deb
and what would be owed to Deb
Deb
as a result of her taking on fulltime parenthood

So let's go back to Lisa and Andy

Lisa had an inheritance from her grandmother

before the marriage

And when they got married they bought a home

and Lisa put that inheritance toward a down payment on that home
Lisa
And then Andy of course worked to make the mortgage payments
Andy
And all of their premarital and marital property

became joined

That inheritance is now marital property

So in a split what's going to happen

They're going to have to sell the house and split the proceeds

or one of them can buy the other out

So this marriage mediator

if they had talked to them before all of this happened

that person would have asked

What do you want to keep separate and what do you want to keep together

And how does that choice

actually support the security of the marriage

Because you have to remember

that what's yours probably will become ours

unless you actually are mindful and take steps to do otherwise

So if they had thought about their split

maybe they would have decided differently

maybe Lisa would have thought

Maybe the inheritance can stay separate

and saved for a day when they might actually need it

And maybe the mortgage that they took on wouldn't have been as onerous

and maybe Andy wouldn't have had to work so hard to make those payments
Andy
And maybe he would have become less resentful

Maybe they would have lived in a smaller house

and been content to do that

The point is

if they had had a divorceconscious discussion

about what to keep separate

their marriage might have been more connected and more together

Too often in marriage we make sacrifices

and we demand them

without reckoning their cost

But there is wisdom in looking at the price tags

attached to our marital decisions

in just the way that divorce law teaches us to do

What I want

is for people to think about their marital bargains

through the lens of divorce

And to ask

How is marriage a sacrifice

but an exchange of sacrifice

How do we think about our exchange

Second

How do we think about childcare

and deal with the fact

that there is no such thing as free childcare

How do we deal with the fact

that some things can be separate and some things can be together

and if we don't think about it

then it will all be part of the joint enterprise

So basically

what I want to leave you with is that in marriage or divorce

people should think about the way

that till death do us part marriage

is forever

Thank you

So I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one in this room

who at some point have found myself you know looking up towards the stars

and wondered you know Are we it

or are there other living planets out there such as our own

I guess it is possible that I'm then the only person

who has obsessed enough about that question

to make it my career

But moving on

How do we get to this question

Well I would argue the first thing to do

is to turn our eyes back down from the sky to our own planet the Earth

And think about just how lucky did the Earth have to be

to be the living planet it is

Well it had to be at least somewhat lucky

Had we been sitting closer to the Sun

or a bit further away

any water that we have had would have boiled off or frozen over

And I mean it's not a given that a planet has water on it

So had we been a dry planet

there would not have been a lot of life on it

And even if we had had all the water that we have today

if that water had not been accompanied

by the right kind of chemicals to get life going

we would have a wet planet but just as dead

So it's so many things that can go wrong

what are the chances that they go right

What are the chances that the planet forms

with at least the basic ingredients needed

to have an origins of life happening

Well let's explore that together

So if you're going to have a living planet

the first thing you're going to need

is a planet

Laughter

But not any planet will do

You're probably going to need a rather specific and earthlike planet

A planet that is rocky

so you can have both oceans and land

and it's sitting neither too close nor too far away from its star

but at the justright temperature

And it's just right for liquid water that is

So how many of these planets do we have in our galaxy

Well one of the great discoveries of the past decades

is that planets are incredibly common

Almost every star has a planet around them

Some have many

And among these planets

on the order of a few percent are earthlike enough

that we would consider them potentially living planets

So having the right kind of planet is actually not that difficult

when we consider that there's about  billion stars in our galaxy

So that gives you about a billion potential living planets

But it's not enough to just be at the right temperature

or have the right overall composition

You also need the right chemicals

And what the second and important ingredient to make a living planet is 

I think it's pretty intuitive 

it's water

After all we did define our planet as being potentially living

if it had the right temperature to keep water liquid

And I mean here on Earth life is waterbased

But more generally

water is just really good as a meeting place for chemicals

It is a very special liquid

So this is our second basic ingredient

Now the third ingredient I think

is probably a little bit more surprising

I mean we are going to need some organics in there

since we are thinking about organic life

But the organic molecule

that seems to be at the center of the chemical networks

that can produce biomolecules is hydrogen cyanide

So for those of you who know what this molecule is like

you know it's something that it's a good idea to stay away from

But it turns out

that what's really really bad for advanced life forms

such as yourselves

is really really good to get the chemistry started

the right kind of chemistry that can lead to origins of life

So now we have our three ingredients that we need

you know the temperate planet

water and hydrogen cyanide

So how often do these three come together

How many temperate planets are there out there

that have water and hydrogen cyanide

Well in an ideal world

we would now turn one of our telescopes towards one of these temperate planets

and check for ourselves

Just Do these planets have water and cyanides on them

Unfortunately we don't yet have large enough telescopes to do this

We can detect molecules in the atmospheres of some planets

But these are large planets

sitting often pretty close to their star

nothing like these you know justright planets

that we're talking about here

which are much smaller and further away

So we have to come up with another way

And the other way that we have conceived of and then followed

is to instead of looking for these molecules

in the planets when they exist

is to look for them in the material that's forming new planets

So planets form in discs of dust and gas around young stars

And these discs get their material from the interstellar medium

Turns out that the empty space you see between stars

when you are looking up towards them asking existential questions

is not as empty as it seems

but actually full of gas and dust

which can you know come together in clouds

then collapses to form these discs stars and planets

And one of the things we always see when we do look at these clouds

is water

You know I think we have a tendency to think about water

as something that's you know special to us

Water is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe

including in these clouds

these star and planetforming clouds

And not only that 

water is also a pretty robust molecule

it's actually not that easy to destroy

So a lot of this water that is in interstellar medium

will survive the rather dangerous collapsed journey from clouds

to disc to planet

So water is alright

That second ingredient is not going to be a problem

Most planets are going to form with some access to water

So what about hydrogen cyanide

Well we also see cyanides and other similar organic molecules

in these interstellar clouds

But here we're less certain about the molecules surviving

going from the cloud to the disc

They're just a bit more delicate a bit more fragile

So if we're going to know that this hydrogen cyanide

is sitting in the vicinity of new planets forming

we'd really need to see it in the disc itself

in these planetforming discs

So about a decade ago

I started a program to look for this hydrogen cyanide

and other molecules in these planetforming discs

And this is what we found

So good news in these six images

those bright pixels represent emissions originating from hydrogen cyanide

in planetforming discs hundreds of lightyears away

that have made it to our telescope

onto the detector

allowing us to see it like this

So the very good news

is that these discs do indeed have hydrogen cyanide in them

That last more elusive ingredient

Now the bad news is that we don't know where in the disc it is

If we look at these

I mean no one can say they are beautiful images

even at the time when we got them

You see the pixel size is pretty big

and it's actually bigger than these discs themselves

So each pixel here

represents something that's much bigger than our solar system

And that means

that we don't know where in the disc the hydrogen cyanide is coming from

And that's a problem

because these temperate planets

they can't access hydrogen cyanide just anywhere

but it must be fairly close to where they assemble

for them to have access to it

So to bring this home let's think about an analogous example

that is of cypress growing in the United States

So let's say hypothetically

that you've returned from Europe

where you have seen beautiful Italian cypresses

and you want to understand you know

does it make sense to import them to the United States

Could you grow them here

So you talk to the cypress experts

they tell you that there is indeed

a band of nottoohot nottoocold across the United States

where you could grow them

And if you have a nice highresolution map or image like this

it's quite easy to see that this cypress strip

overlaps with a lot of green fertile land pixels

Even if I start degrading this map quite a bit

making it lower and lower resolution

it's still possible to tell

that there's going to be some fertile land overlapping with this strip

But what about if the whole United States

is incorporated into a single pixel

If the resolution is that low

What do you do now

how do you now tell whether you can grow cypresses in the United States

Well the answer is you can't

I mean there's definitely some fertile land there

or you wouldn't have that green tint to the pixel

but there's just no way of telling

whether any of that green is in the right place

And that is exactly the problem we were facing

with our singlepixel images of these discs

with hydrogen cyanide

So what we need is something analogous

at least those lowresolution maps that I just showed you

to be able to tell whether there's overlap between where the hydrogen cyanide is

and where these planets can access it as they are forming

So coming to the rescue a few years ago

is this new amazing beautiful telescope ALMA
ALMA
the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array

in northern Chile

So ALMA is amazing in many different ways
ALMA
but the one that I'm going to focus on

is that as you can see I call this one telescope

but you can there are actually many dishes in this image

And this is a telescope that consists of  individual dishes

that all work in unison

And that means that you have a telescope

that is the size of the largest distance that you can put these dishes

away from one another

Which in ALMA's case are a few miles
ALMA
So you have a more than milesized telescope

And when you have such a big telescope

you can zoom in on really small things

including making maps of hydrogen cyanide in these planetforming discs

So when ALMA came online a few years ago
ALMA
that was one of the first things that I proposed that we use it for

And what does a map of hydrogen cyanide look like in a disc

Is the hydrogen cyanide at the right place

And the answer is that it is

So this is the map

You see the hydrogen cyanide emission being spread out across the disc

First of all it's almost everywhere

which is very good news

But you have a lot of extra bright emission

coming from close to the star towards the center of the disc

And this is exactly where we want to see it

This is close to where these planets are forming

And this is not what we see just towards one disc 

here are three more examples

You can see they all show the same thing 

lots of bright hydrogen cyanide emission

coming from close to the center of the star

For full disclosure we don't always see this

There are discs where we see the opposite

where there's actually a hole in the emission towards the center

So this is the opposite of what we want to see right

This is not places where we could research

if there is any hydrogen cyanide around where these planets are forming

But in most cases

we just don't detect hydrogen cyanide

but we detect it in the right place

So what does all this mean

Well I told you in the beginning

that we have lots of these temperate planets

maybe a billion or so of them

that could have life develop on them

if they have the right ingredients

And I've also shown

that we think a lot of the time the right ingredients are there 

we have water we have hydrogen cyanide

there will be other organic molecules as well

coming with the cyanides

This means that planets with the most basic ingredients for life

are likely to be incredibly common in our galaxy

And if all it takes for life to develop

is to have these basic ingredients available

there should be a lot of living planets out there

But that is of course a big if

And I would say the challenge of the next decades

for both astronomy and chemistry

is to figure out just how often

we go from having a potentially living planet

to having an actually living one

Thank you

Applause

I live in Utah

a place known for having some of the most aweinspiring

natural landscapes on this planet

It's easy to be overwhelmed by these amazing views

and to be really fascinated by these sometimes alienlooking formations

As a scientist I love observing the natural world

But as a cell biologist

I'm much more interested in understanding the natural world

at a much much smaller scale

I'm a molecular animator and I work with other researchers

to create visualizations of molecules that are so small

they're essentially invisible

These molecules are smaller than the wavelength of light

which means that we can never see them directly

even with the best light microscopes

So how do I create visualizations of things

that are so small we can't see them

Scientists like my collaborators

can spend their entire professional careers

working to understand one molecular process

To do this they carry out a series of experiments

that each can tell us a small piece of the puzzle

One kind of experiment can tell us about the protein shape

while another can tell us

about what other proteins it might interact with

and another can tell us about where it can be found in a cell

And all of these bits of information can be used to come up with a hypothesis

a story essentially of how a molecule might work

My job is to take these ideas and turn them into an animation

This can be tricky

because it turns out that molecules can do some pretty crazy things

But these animations can be incredibly useful for researchers

to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work

They can also allow us to see the molecular world

through their eyes

I'd like to show you some animations

a brief tour of what I consider to be some of the natural wonders

of the molecular world

First off this is an immune cell

These kinds of cells need to go crawling around in our bodies

in order to find invaders like pathogenic bacteria

This movement is powered by one of my favorite proteins

called actin

which is part of what's known as the cytoskeleton

Unlike our skeletons

actin filaments are constantly being built and taken apart

The actin cytoskeleton plays incredibly important roles in our cells

They allow them to change shape

to move around to adhere to surfaces

and also to gobble up bacteria

Actin is also involved in a different kind of movement

In our muscle cells actin structures form these regular filaments

that look kind of like fabric

When our muscles contract these filaments are pulled together

and they go back to their original position

when our muscles relax

Other parts of the cytoskeleton in this case microtubules

are responsible for longrange transportation

They can be thought of as basically cellular highways

that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the other

Unlike our roads microtubules grow and shrink

appearing when they're needed

and disappearing when their job is done

The molecular version of semitrucks

are proteins aptly named motor proteins

that can walk along microtubules

dragging sometimes huge cargoes

like organelles behind them

This particular motor protein is known as dynein

and its known to be able to work together in groups

that almost look at least to me like a chariot of horses

As you see the cell is this incredibly changing dynamic place
As you see the cell is this incredibly changing dynamic place
where things are constantly being built and disassembled

But some of these structures

are harder to take apart than others though

And special forces need to be brought in

in order to make sure that structures are taken apart in a timely manner

That job is done in part by proteins like these

These donutshaped proteins

of which there are many types in the cell

all seem to act to rip apart structures

by basically pulling individual proteins through a central hole

When these kinds of proteins don't work properly

the types of proteins that are supposed to get taken apart

can sometimes stick together and aggregate

and that can give rise to terrible diseases such as Alzheimer's

And now let's take a look at the nucleus

which houses our genome in the form of DNA
DNA
In all of our cells

our DNA is cared for and maintained by a diverse set of proteins
DNA
DNA is wound around proteins called histones
DNA
which enable cells to pack large amounts of DNA into our nucleus
DNA
These machines are called chromatin remodelers

and the way they work is that they basically scoot the DNA
DNA
around these histones

and they allow new pieces of DNA to become exposed
DNA
This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery
DNA
In this case this large molecular machine

is looking for a segment of DNA
DNA
that tells it it's at the beginning of a gene

Once it finds a segment

it basically undergoes a series of shape changes

which enables it to bring in other machinery

that in turn allows a gene to get turned on or transcribed

This has to be a very tightly regulated process

because turning on the wrong gene at the wrong time

can have disastrous consequences

Scientists are now able to use protein machines

to edit genomes

I'm sure all of you have heard of CRISPR
CRISPR
CRISPR takes advantage of a protein known as Cas
CRISPRCas
which can be engineered to recognize and cut

a very specific sequence of DNA
DNA
In this example

two Cas proteins are being used to excise a problematic piece of DNA
CasDNA
For example a part of a gene that may give rise to a disease

Cellular machinery is then used

to basically glue two ends of the DNA back together
DNA
As a molecular animator

one of my biggest challenges is visualizing uncertainty

All of the animations I've shown to you represent hypotheses

how my collaborators think a process works

based on the best information that they have

But for a lot of molecular processes

we're still really at the early stages of understanding things

and there's a lot to learn

The truth is

that these invisible molecular worlds are vast and largely unexplored

To me these molecular landscapes

are just as exciting to explore as a natural world

that's visible all around us

Thank you

A friend called me a few weeks ago

with bad news

She dropped her cell phone into the toilet

Anyone here done that before

Laughter

So it was a bad situation

You know without getting into the details of exactly how that happened

or how she got it out

let's just say it was a bad situation

And she panicked because like for many of us

her phone is one of the most used and essential tools in her life

But on the other hand she had no idea how to fix it

because it's a completely mysterious black box

So think about it what would you do

What do you really understand about how your phone works

What are you willing to test or fix

For most people the answer is nothing

In fact one survey found

that almost  percent of smartphone users in this country

have never even replaced their phone batteries

and  percent didn't even know this was possible

Now I'm an experimental physicist

hence the toys

I specialize in making new types of nanoscale electronic devices

to study their fundamental quantum mechanical properties

But even I wouldn't know where to start in terms of testing elements on my phone

if it broke

And phones are just one example of the many devices that we depend upon

but can't test take apart or even fully understand

Cars electronics even toys are now so complicated and advanced

that we're scared to open and fix them

So here's the problem

there's a disconnect between us and the technology that we use

We're completely alienated from the devices that we most depend upon

which can make us feel helpless and empty

In fact it's not surprising then that one study found

that we are now more afraid of technology

than we are of death

Laughter

But I think that we can reconnect to our devices

rehumanize them in a sense

by doing more handson experiments

Why Well because an experiment is a procedure to test a hypothesis

demonstrate a fact

It's the way that we use our senses

our hands

to connect the world

and figure out how it works

And that's the connection that we're missing

So let me give you an example

Here's an experiment that I did recently

to think about how a touchscreen works

It's just two metal plates

and I can put charge on one of the plates from a battery

OK

And I can measure the charge separation with this voltmeter here

Now  let's make sure it's working

So when I wave my hand near the plates

you can see that the voltage changes

just like the touchscreen responds to my hand

But what is it about my hand Now I need to do more experiments

So I can say take a piece of wood

and touch one of the plates and see that not much happens

but if I take a piece of metal and touch the plate

then the voltage changes dramatically

So now I can do further experiments to see what the difference is

between the wood and the metal

and I should find out that the wood is not conducting

but the metal is conducting like my hand

And you see I build up my understanding

Like now I can see why I can't use a touchscreen with gloves

because gloves aren't conducting

But I've also broken down some of the mystery behind the technology

and built up my agency

my personal input and interactions with the basis of my devices

But experimenting is a step beyond just taking things apart

It's testing and doing handson critical thinking

And it doesn't really matter whether I'm testing how a touchscreen works

or if I'm measuring how conducting different types of materials are

or even if I'm just using my hands to see how hard it is to break

different thicknesses of materials

In all cases I'm gaining control and understanding

of the basis of the things that I use

And there's research behind this

For one I'm using my hands

which seem to promote wellbeing

I'm also engaging in handson learning

which has been shown to improve understanding and retention

and even activate more parts of your brain

So handson thinking through experiments

connects our understanding

even our sense of vitality

to the physical world and the things that we use

Looking things up on the internet

does not have the same effect

Now for me this focus on experiments

is also personal

I didn't grow up doing experiments

I didn't know what a physicist did

I remember my sister had a chemistry set that I always wanted to use

but she never let me touch

I felt mentally disconnected from the world

and didn't know why

In fact when I was nine years old

my grandmother called me a solipsist

which is something I had to look up

It means that you think that yourself is all that exists

And at the time I was pretty offended

because whose grandmother calls them that

Laughter

But I think that it was true

And it wasn't until years later

when I was in college and studying basic physics

that I had a revelation

that the world

at least the physical world

could be tested and understood

that I started to gain a completely different sense

of how the world worked

and what my place was in it

And then later when I was able my own testing

and understanding through research

a big part of my connection to the world was complete

Now I know that not everyone is an experimental physicist by profession

but I think that everyone could be doing more handson experiments

And actually I think we sort of 

I'll give you another example

I was recently working with some middle school students

helping them learn about magnetism

and I gave them a Magna Doodle to take apart
Magna Doodle
Remember one of these things

So at first none of them wanted to touch it

They'd been told for so long not to break things

that they're accustomed to just passive using

But then I started asking them questions

You know how does it work What parts are magnetic

Can you make a hypothesis and test it

But they still didn't want to break it open

They wanted to take it home with them really

Until one kid finally sliced it through and found really cool stuff inside

And so this is something we can do here together

They're pretty easy to take apart

See there's a magnet inside and I can just cut this open

Cut it open again you can split it

OK so when I do that  I don't know if you can see this

but there is sort of  there it is this oozy white stuff in here

Now you can see it on my finger

And when I drag the pen on it

you can see that these filaments are attached to it

So the kids saw this

and at this point they're like this is really cool

They got excited

They all started ripping them open and taking them apart

and yelling out the things that they discovered

how these magnetic filaments connected to the magnetic pen

and that's how it wrote

Or how the oozy white stuff kept things dispersed so it could write

And as they were leaving the room

two of them turned to me and said

We loved that

Me and her are going home this weekend to do more experiments

Laughter

Yeah I know the parents in there are worried about it

but it's a good thing

Experimenting is good and actually I found it extremely gratifying

and I think hopefully it was very lifeenriching for them

Because even a basic magnet

is something that we can experiment with at home

They're both simple and complex at the same time

For example you can ask yourself

how can the same material both attract and repel

If I take a magnet is it useful if I can get one of them

to rotate the other for example

Or you can take this dollar bill over here

and I can take a set of magnets

and you can see that the dollar bill gets lifted by the magnets

There's magnetic ink hidden in here that prevents counterfeiting

Or here I have some crushedup bran cereal OK

And that's also magnetic Right

That has iron in it

Laughter

And that can be good for you right

OK here's something else

This thing over here is not magnetic

I can't lift it up with the magnet

But now I'm going to make it cold

The same thing in here cold

and when I make it cold

and put it on top of the magnet

so 

Applause

It's amazing

That's not magnetic

but somehow it's interacting with a magnet

So clearly understanding this is going to take many more experiments

In fact this is something that I've spent much of my career studying

It's called a superconductor

Now superconductors can be complex

but even simple experiments can connect us better to the world

So now if I tell you that flash memory works by rotating small magnets

then you can imagine it You've seen it

Or if I say that MRI machines
MRI
use magnetism to rotate magnetic particles in your body

you've seen it done

You've interacted with the technology and understood the basis of these devices

Now I know that it's hard to add more things to our lives

especially experiments

But I think that the challenge is worth it

Think about how something works then take it apart to test it

Manipulate something and prove some physical principle to yourself

Put the human back in the technology

You'll be surprised at the connections that you make

Thank you

Applause

I am a public policy wonk

I investigate data that points to problems in the American economy 

problems like rising household debt

declining wages and benefits

shortfalls in public revenue

And I try to pinpoint solutions

to make our economy more prosperous for more people

I geek out about tax policy

and infrastructure investments

and I get really excited

by a gracefully designed regulatory regime

Laughter

These are the kinds of topics that I was talking about

on a public television live callin show in August of 

I was about halfway through the program

when a man called in

identified as Gary from North Carolina

and he said 

I'm a white male and I'm prejudiced

He then went on to detail his prejudice

talking about black men and gangs

and drugs and crime

But then he said something that I'll never forget

He said But I want to change

And I want to know what I can do to become a better American

Now remember my career is about economic policy

as translated into dollars and cents

not personal thoughts and feelings

But when I opened my mouth to respond to this man on live television

the most surprising words came out

I said 
 
Thank you

I thanked him for admitting his prejudice

for wanting to change and for knowing somehow

that that would make him a better American

The exchange between Gary and me went viral

It's been viewed over eight million times

and inspired waves of social media commentary

and news coverage

And I think people were surprised

that a black woman would show such compassion

for a prejudiced white man

and they were surprised that a white man would admit his bias

on national television

Not long after Gary and my viral moment
Gary
we met in person

He said that he had taken my advice

He said that my words had been like someone wiped the dust from a window

and let the light in

Over the years Gary and I have become friends

And Gary would tell you that I've taught him a lot

about systemic racism in America and public policy

But I've learned a lot from Gary too

And the biggest lesson for me

has been that Gary's prejudice has caused him to suffer

Fear anxiety isolation

And it's made me rethink

many of the economic problems I've been focusing on

my entire career

I wondered

is it possible that our society's racism

has likewise been backfiring on the very same people

set up to benefit from privilege

Driven by this question

I've spent the past few years traveling the country

researching and writing a book

My conclusion

Racism leads to bad policymaking

It's making our economy worse

And not just in ways that disadvantage people of color

It turns out it's not a zero sum

Racism is bad for white people too

Take for example

America's underinvestment in our public goods

the things that we all need that we share in common 

our schools and roads and bridges

Our infrastructure gets a D plus
D 
from the American Society of Civil Engineers

and we invest less per capita than almost every other advanced nation

But it wasn't always this way

I traveled to Montgomery Alabama

and there I saw how racism can destroy a public good

and the public will to support it

In the s and 's

the United States went on a nationwide building boom of public amenities

funded by tax dollars

which in Montgomery Alabama included the Oak Park pool

which was the grandest one for miles

You know back then people didn't have air conditioners

and so they spent their hot summer days

in a steady rotation of sunning and splashing

and then cooling off under a ring of nearby trees

It was the meeting place for the town

Except the Oak Park pool

though it was funded by all of Montgomery citizens

was for whites only

When a federal court finally deemed this unconstitutional

the reaction of the town council was swift

Effective January  

they decided they would drain the public pool

rather than let black families swim too

This destruction of public goods

was replicated across the country

in towns not just in the South

Towns closed their public parks pools and schools

all in response to desegregation orders

all throughout the s

In Montgomery they shut down the entire Parks Department

for a decade

They closed the recreation centers

they even sold off the animals in the zoo

Today you can walk the grounds of Oak Park as I did
Oak Park
but very few people do

They never rebuilt the pool

Racism has a cost for everyone

I remember having that same thought on September  

when I learned the breaking news that Lehman Brothers was collapsing

Now Lehman was

like the other financial firms that would go under in the coming days

done in by overexposure to a toxic financial instrument

based on something that used to be simple and safe 

a year fixedrate home loan

But the mortgages at the center and the root of the financial crisis

had strange new terms

And they were developed and aggressively marketed for years

in black and brown middleclass communities

like the one that I visited when I met a homeowner named Glenn

Glenn had owned a home

on a leafy street in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Cleveland

for over a decade

But when I met him he was near foreclosure

Like nearly all of his neighbors

he'd received a knock on the door

from a broker promising to refinance his mortgage

But what the broker didn't tell him was that this was a new kind of mortgage

A mortgage with an inflated interest rate

and a balloon payment

and a prepayment penalty if he tried to get out of it

Now the common misperception

then and still today

is that people like Glenn were buying properties they couldn't afford

That they themselves were risky borrowers

I saw how this stereotype made it harder for policymakers

to see the crisis for what it was

back when we still had time to stop it

But that's all it was

A stereotype

The majority of subprime mortgages went to people who had good credit

like Glenn

And African Americans and Latinos were three times as likely 

even if they had good credit 

than white people to get sold these toxic loans

The problem wasn't the borrower 

the problem was the loan

After the crash

most of the nation's big lenders from Wells Fargo to Countrywide
Countrywide
would go on to be fined for racial discrimination

But that realization came too late

These loans superprofitable for the lenders

but designed to fail for the borrowers

spread out past the confines

of black and brown neighborhoods like Glenn's
Glenn's
and into the wider whiter mortgage market

All of the nation's big Wall Street firms bet on these loans

At its peak

one out of every five mortgages in the country was in this mold

and the crisis

the crisis that my colleagues and I saw coming 

would go on to cost us all

Nineteen trillion in lost wealth

Pensions home equity savings

Eight million jobs vanished

A homeownership rate that has never recovered

My years of advocating in vain for homeowners like Glenn

left me convinced

we would not have had a financial crisis if it weren't for racism

In  I traveled to Mississippi

where a group of autofactory workers was trying to organize into a union

Now the benefits they were fighting for 

higher pay better health care coverage

a real pension 

they would have helped everybody at the plant

But in person after person that I talked to 

white black for the union against the union 

race kept coming up

A white man named Joey put it this way

He said

White workers think I ain't voting yes if the blacks are voting yes

If the blacks are for it I'm against it

A white man named Chip told me

The idea is that if you uplift black people

you're downing white people

It's like the world's got this crabinabarrel mentality

Now the union vote failed

Wages at the plant are still lower than their unionized peers'

and people there still worry about their health care

You know it's tempting perhaps

to focus on the prejudiced attitudes

of the men and the workers that I heard in Mississippi

But I'm more interested in holding accountable

the people who are selling racist ideas for their profit

than those who are desperate enough to buy it

My travels also took me to places

where I saw however that it doesn't have to be this way

I went to Maine the whitest state in the nation

the oldest

where there are more deaths every year than births

and I went to this dying mill town called Lewiston

that is being revitalized by new people 

mostly African mostly Muslim

immigrants and refugees

There I met a woman named Cecile

whose parents had been part of the last wave of new people

to come to Lewiston

These are FrenchCanadian millworkers at the turn of the century

Cecile is retired but she had found a new purpose in life

by organizing Congolese refugees

to join with the white retirees at the Franco Heritage Center

Laughter

These men and women from the Congo

were helping these retirees remember the French

that they hadn't spoken since their childhoods

And together these two communities helped each other feel at home

You know for all the political talk

about the newcomers being a drain on the town

a bipartisan think tank found that the local refugee community there

created  million dollars in tax revenue

and  million in income

And I talked to the town administrator

who was boasting about the fact that Lewiston was building a new school

when all the rest of towns like theirs in Maine

was closing them

You know it costs us so much to remain divided

This zerosum thinking

that's what's good for one group has to come at the expense of another

it's what's gotten us into this mess

I believe it's time to reject that old paradigm

and realize that our fates are linked

An injury to one is an injury to all

You know we have a choice

Our nation was founded on a belief in a hierarchy of human value

But we are about to be a country with no racial majority

So we can keep pretending like we're not all on the same team

We can keep sabotaging our success

and hamstringing our own players

Or we can let the proximity of so much difference

reveal our common humanity

And we can finally invest in our greatest asset

Our people

All of our people

Thank you

Helen Walters So Chris who's up first
Helen Walters
Chris Anderson Well we have a man who's worried about pandemics
Chris Anderson
pretty much his whole life

He played an absolutely key role more than  years ago

in helping the world get rid of the scourge of smallpox

And in 

he came to TED to warn the world
TED
of the dire risk of a global pandemic

and what we might do about it

So please welcome here Dr Larry Brilliant
Larry Brilliant
Larry so good to see you

Larry Brilliant Thank you nice to see you
Larry Brilliant
CA Larry in that talk
CA
you showed a video clip that was a simulation

of what a pandemic might look like

I would like to play it  this gave me chills

Larry Brilliant TED Let me show you a simulation
Larry BrilliantTED
of what a pandemic looks like

so we know what we're talking about

Let's assume for example that the first case occurs in South Asia

It initially goes quite slowly

you get two or three discrete locations

Then there will be secondary outbreaks

And the disease will spread from country to country so fast

that you won't know what hit you

Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world

Now if we had an undo button

and we could go back

and isolate it and grab it when it first started

if we could find it early and we had early detection

and early response

and we could put each one of those viruses in jail

that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic

CA Larry that phrase you mentioned there
CA
early detection early response

that was a key theme of that talk

you made us all repeat it several times

Is that still the key to preventing a pandemic

LB Oh surely
LB
You know when you have a pandemic

something moving at exponential speed

if you miss the first two weeks if you're late the first two weeks

it's not the deaths and the illness from the first two weeks you lose

it's the two weeks at the peak

Those are prevented if you act early

Early response is critical

early detection is a condition precedent

CA And how would you grade the world
CA
on its early detection early response to COVID
COVID
LB Of course you gave me this question earlier
LB
so I've been thinking a lot about it

I think I would go through the countries

and I've actually made a list

I think the island republics of Taiwan Iceland and certainly New Zealand

would get an A
A
The island republic of the UK and the United States 

which is not an island no matter how much we may think we are 

would get a failing grade

I'd give a B to South Korea and to Germany
B
And in between 

So it's a very heterogeneous response I think

The world as a whole is faltering

We shouldn't be proud of what's happening right now

CA I mean we got the detection pretty early
CA
or at least some doctors in China got the detection pretty early

LB Earlier than the  SARS which took six months
LBSARS
This took about six weeks

And detection means not only finding it

but knowing what it is

So I would give us a pretty good score on that

The transparency the communication  those are other issues

CA So what was the key mistake
CA
that you think the countries you gave an F to made
F
LB I think fear
LB
political incompetence interference

not taking it seriously soon enough 

it's pretty human

I think throughout history

pretty much every pandemic is first viewed with denial and doubt

But those countries that acted quickly

and even those who started slow like South Korea

they could still make up for it and they did really well

We've had two months that we've lost

We've given a virus that moves exponentially

a twomonth head start

That's not a good idea Chris

CA No indeed
CA
I mean there's so much puzzling information still out there

about this virus

What do you think the scientific consensus is going to likely end up being

on like the two key numbers

of its infectiousness and its fatality rate

LB So I think the kind of equation to keep in mind
LB
is that the virus moves dependent on three major issues

One is the R
R
the first number of secondary cases that there are when the virus emerges

In this case

people talk about it being  

But a really important paper three weeks ago

in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal came out

suggesting that looking back on the Wuhan data

it's really 

So for argument's sake

let's say that the virus is moving at exponential speed

and the exponent is somewhere between  and 

The other two factors that matter

are the incubation period or the generation time

The longer that is

the slower the pandemic appears to us

When it's really short like six days it moves like lightning

And then the last and the most important 

and it's often overlooked 

is the density of susceptibles

This is a novel virus

so we want to know how many customers could it potentially have

And as it's novel that's eight billion of us

The world is facing a virus

that looks at all of us like equally susceptible

Doesn't matter our color our race

or how wealthy we are

CA I mean none of the numbers that you've mentioned so far
CA
are in themselves different from any other infections in recent years

What is the combination that has made this so deadly

LB Well it is exactly the combination
LB
of the short incubation period and the high transmissibility

But you know everybody on this call has known somebody who has the disease

Sadly many have lost a loved one

This is a terrible disease when it is serious

And I get calls from doctors in emergency rooms

and treating people in ICUs all over the world

and they all say the same thing

How do I choose who is going to live and who is going to die

I have so few tools to deal with

It's a terrifying disease

to die alone with a ventilator in your lungs

and it's a disease that affects all of our organs

It's a respiratory disease 

perhaps misleading

Makes you think of a flu

But so many of the patients have blood in their urine

from kidney disease

they have gastroenteritis

they certainly have heart failure very often

we know that it affects taste and smell the olfactory nerves

we know of course about the lung

The question I have

is there any organ that it does not affect

And in that sense

it reminds me all too much of smallpox

CA So we're in a mess
CA
What's the way forward from here

LB Well the way forward is still the same
LB
Rapid detection

rapid response

Finding every case

and then figuring out all the contacts

We've got great new technology for contact tracing

we've got amazing scientists working at the speed of light

to give us test kits and antivirals and vaccines

We need to slow down

the Buddhists say slow down time

so that you can put your heart your soul into that space

We need to slow down the speed of this virus

which is why we do social distancing

Just to be clear 

flattening the curve social distancing

it doesn't change the absolute number of cases

but it changes what could be a Mount Fujilike peak

into a pulse

and then we won't also lose people because of competition for hospital beds

people who have heart attacks need chemotherapy difficult births

can get into the hospital

and we can use the scarce resources we have

especially in the developing world

to treat people

So slow down

slow down the speed of the epidemic

and then in the troughs in between waves

jump on double down step on it

and find every case

trace every contact

test every case

and then only quarantine the ones who need to be quarantined

and do that until we have a vaccine

CA So it sounds like we have to get past the stage of just mitigation
CA
where we're just trying to take a general shutdown

to the point where we can start identifying individual cases again

and contacttrace for them

and treat them separately

I mean to do that

that seems like it's going to take a step up of coordination

ambition organization investment

that we're not really seeing the signs of yet in some countries

Can we do this how can we do this

LB Oh of course we can do this
LB
I mean Taiwan did it so beautifully

Iceland did it so beautifully Germany

all with different strategies

South Korea

It really requires competent governance

a sense of seriousness

and listening to the scientists not the politicians following the virus

Of course we can do this

Let me remind everybody 

this is not the zombie apocalypse

it's not a mass extinction event

You know   percent of us are going to get out of this alive

We need to deal with it the way we know we can

and we need to be the best version of ourselves

Both sitting at home

as well as in science and certainly in leadership

CA And might there be even worse pathogens out there
CA
in the future

Like can you picture or describe

an even worse combination of those numbers

that we should start to get ready for

LB Well smallpox had an R of  to 
LBR
so that's probably about what I think this COVID will be
COVID
But it killed a third of the people

But we had a vaccine

So those are the different sets that you have

But what I'm mostly worried about

and the reason that we made Contagion

and that was a fictional virus 

I repeat for those of you watching

that's fiction

We created a virus that killed a lot more than this one did

CA You're talking about the movie Contagion
CA
that's been trending on Netflix
Netflix
And you were an advisor for

LB Absolutely that's right
LB
But we made that movie deliberately

to show what a real pandemic looked like

but we did choose a pretty awful virus

And the reason we showed it like that

going from a bat to an apple

to a pig to a cook to Gwyneth Paltrow

was because that is in nature what we call spillover

as zoonotic diseases

diseases of animals spill over to human beings

And if I look backwards three decades

or forward three decades 

looking backward three decades Ebola SARS Zika

swine flu bird flu West Nile

we can begin almost a catechism

and listen to all the cacophony of these names

But there were  to  novel viruses that jumped into human beings

And I'm afraid looking forward

we are in the age of pandemics

we have to behave like that

we need to practice One Health

we need to understand that we're living in the same world

as animals the environment and us

and we get rid of this fiction that we are some kind of special species

To the virus we're not

CA Mmm
CA
You mentioned vaccines though

Do you see any accelerated path to a vaccine

LB I do
LB
I'm actually excited to see that we're doing something

that we only get to think of in computer science

which is we're changing what should have always been

or has always been rather

multiple sequential processes

Do safety testing then you test for effectiveness

then for efficiency

And then you manufacture

We're doing all three or four of those steps

instead of doing it in sequence we're doing in parallel

Bill Gates has said he's going to build seven vaccine production lines

in the United States

and start preparing for production

not knowing what the end vaccine is going to be

We're simultaneously doing safety tests and efficacy tests

I think the NIH has jumped up
NIH
I'm very thrilled to see that

CA And how does that translate into a likely time line do you think
CA
A year  months is that possible

LB You know Tony Fauci is our guru in this
LBTony Fauci
and he said  to  months

I think that we will do faster than that in the initial vaccine

But you may have heard that this virus

may not give us the longterm immunity 

that something like smallpox would do

So we're trying to make vaccines where we add adjuvants

that actually make the vaccine create better immunity

than the disease

so that we can confer immunity for many years

That's going to take a little longer

CA Last question Larry
CA
Back in  as a winner of the TED Prize
TED
we granted you a wish

and you wished the world would create this pandemic preparedness system

that would prevent something like this happening

I feel like we the world let you down

If you were to make another wish now

what would it be

LB Well I don't think we're let down in terms of speed of detection
LB
I'm actually pretty pleased

When we met in 

the average one of these viruses leaping from an animal to a human

it took us six months to find that 

like the first Ebola for example

We're now finding the first cases in two weeks

I'm not unhappy about that

I'd like to push it down to a single incubation period

It's a bigger issue for me

What I found is that in the Smallpox Eradication Programme

people of all colors all religions all races

so many countries

came together

And it took working as a global community

to conquer a global pandemic

Now I feel that we have become victims of centrifugal forces

We're in our nationalistic kind of barricades

We will not be able to conquer a pandemic

unless we believe we're all in it together

This is not some Age of Aquarius or Kumbaya statement
Kumbaya
this is what a pandemic forces us to realize

We are all in it together

we need a global solution to a global problem

Anything less than that is unthinkable

CA Larry Brilliant thank you so very much
CALarry Brilliant
LB Thank you Chris
LB
Hi everyone my name is Elizabeth

and I work on the trading floor

But I'm still pretty new to it

I graduated from college about a year and a half ago

and to be quite honest

I'm still recovering from the recruiting process

I had to go through to get here

Laughter

Now I don't know about you

but this is the most ridiculous thing

that I still remember about the whole process

was asking insecure college students what their biggest passion was

Like do you expect me to have an answer for that

Laughter

Of course I did

And to be quite honest

I really showed those recruiters just how passionate I was

by telling them all about my early interest in the global economy

which conveniently stemmed from the conversations

that I would overhear my immigrant parents having

about money and the fluctuating value of the Mexican peso

They love a good personal story

But you know what

I lied

Laughter

And not because the things I said weren't true 

I mean my parents were talking about this stuff

But that's not really why I decided to jump into finance

I just really wanted to pay my rent

Laughter

And here's the thing

The reality of having to pay my rent and do real adult things

is something that we're rarely willing to admit to employers

to others and even to ourselves

I know I wasn't about to tell my recruiters

that I was there for the money

And that's because for the most part

we want to see ourselves as idealists

and as people who do what they believe in

and pursue the things that they find the most exciting

But the reality is

very few of us actually have the privilege to do that

Now I can't speak for everyone

but this is especially true for young immigrant professionals like me

And the reason this is true has something to do with the narratives

that society has kept hitting us with

in the news in the workplace

and even by those annoyingly selfcritical voices in our heads

So what narratives am I referring to

Well there's two that come to mind when it comes to immigrants

The first is the idea of the immigrant worker

You know people that come to the US in search of jobs as laborers

or field workers dish washers

You know things that we might consider lowwage jobs

but the immigrants

That's a good opportunity

The news nowadays has convoluted that whole thing quite a bit

You could say that it's made America's relationship with immigrants complicated

And as immigrant expert George Borjas would have put it
George Borjas
it's kind of like America wanted workers

but then they got confused when we got people instead

Laughter

I mean it's natural that people want to strive

to put a roof over their heads and live a normal life right

So for obvious reasons

this narrative has been driving me a little bit crazy

But it's not the only one

The other narrative that I'm going to talk about

is the idea of the superimmigrant

In America we love to idolize superimmigrants

as the ideal symbols of American success

I grew up admiring superimmigrants

because their existence fueled my dreams and it gave me hope

The problem with this narrative is that it also seems to cast a shadow

on those that don't succeed

or that don't make it in that way as less than

And for years I got caught up in the ways

in which it seemed to celebrate one type of immigrant

while villainizing the other

I mean were my parents' sacrifices not enough

Was the fact that my dad came home from the metal factory

covered in corrosive dust

was that not super

Don't get me wrong

I've internalized both of these narratives to some degree

and in many ways

seeing my heroes succeed it has pushed me to do the same

But both of these narratives are flawed in the ways

in which they dehumanize people if they don't fit within a certain mold

or succeed in a certain way

And this really affected my selfimage

because I started to question these ideas for who my parents were

and who I was

and I started to wonder

Am I doing enough to protect my family and my community

from the injustices that we felt every day

So why did I choose to sell out

while watching tragedies unfold right in front of me

Now it took me a long time to come to terms with my decisions

And I really have to thank the people

running the Hispanic Scholarship Fund or HSF
HSF
for validating this process early on

And the way that HSF 
HSF
an organization that strives to help students achieve higher education

through mentorship and scholarships 

the way that they helped calm my anxiety

it was by telling me something super familiar

Something that you all probably have heard before

in the first few minutes after boarding a flight

In case of an emergency

put your oxygen mask on first before helping those around you

Now I understand that this means different things to different people

But for me it meant that immigrants couldn't

and would never be able to fit into any one narrative

because most of us are actually just traveling along a spectrum

trying to survive

And although there may be people that are further along in life

with their oxygen mask on and secured in place

there are undoubtedly going to be others

that are still struggling to put theirs on

before they can even think about helping those around them

Now this lesson really hit home for me

because my parents

while they wanted us to be able to take advantage of opportunities

in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do so anywhere else 

I mean we were in America

and so as a child this made me have these crazy ambitious

and elaborate dreams for what my future could look like

But the ways in which the world sees immigrants

it affects more than just the narratives in which they live

It also impacts the ways laws and systems can affect communities

families and individuals

I know this firsthand

because these laws and systems well they broke up my family

and they led my parents to return to Mexico

And at 

my eightyearold brother and I

we found ourselves alone and without the guidance

that our parents had always provided us with

Despite being American citizens

we both felt defeated

by what we had always known to be the land of opportunity

Now in the weeks that followed my parents' return to Mexico

when it became clear that they wouldn't be able to come back

I had to watch as my eightyearold brother

was pulled out of school to be with his family

And during this same time

I wondered if going back

would be validating my parents' sacrifices

And so I somehow convinced my parents to let me stay

without being able to guarantee them that I'd find somewhere to live

or that I'd be OK

But to this day I will never forget how hard it was

having to say goodbye

And I will never forget how hard it was

watching my little brother crumble in their arms

as I waved goodbye from the other side of steel grates
gr
Now it would be naive to credit grit

as the sole reason for why I've been able to take advantage

of so many opportunities since that day

I mean I was really lucky and I want you to know that

Because statistically speaking

students that are homeless or that have unstable living conditions

well they rarely complete high school

But I do think

that it was because my parents had the trust in letting me go

that I somehow found the courage and strength

to take on opportunities

even when I felt unsure or unqualified

Now there's no denying that there is a cost

to living the American dream

You do not have to be

an immigrant or the child of immigrants to know that

But I do know that now today

I am living something close to what my parents saw

as their American dream

Because as soon as I graduated from college

I flew my younger brother to the United States to live with me

so that he too could pursue his education

Still I knew that it would be hard flying my little brother back

I knew that it would be hard

having to balance the demands and professionalism

required of an entrylevel job

while being responsible for a child with dreams and ambitions of his own

But you can imagine how fun it is to be  years old

at the peak of my youth living in New York

with an angsty teenage roommate who hates doing the dishes

Laughter

The worst

Laughter

But when I see my brother learning how to advocate for himself

and when I see him get excited about his classes and school

I do not doubt anything

Because I know that this bizarre

beautiful and privileged life that I now live

is the true reason for why I decided to pursue a career

that would help me and my family find financial stability

I did not know it back then

but during those eight years that I lived without my family

I had my oxygen mask on and I focused on survival

And during those same eight years

I had to watch helplessly the pain and hurt

that it caused my family to be apart

What airlines don't tell you is that putting your oxygen mask on first

while seeing those around you struggle 

it takes a lot of courage

But being able to have that selfcontrol

is sometimes the only way that we are able to help those around us

Now I'm super lucky to be in a place where I can be there for my little brother

so that he feels confident and prepared

to take on whatever he chooses to do next

But I also know

that because I am in this position of privilege

I also have the responsibility

to make sure that my community finds spaces where they can find guidance

access and support

I can't claim to know where each and every one of you are

on your journey through life

but I do know that our world is one

that flourishes when different voices come together

My hope is that you will find the courage

to put your oxygen mask on when you need to

and that you will find the strength

to help those around you when you can

Thank you

Joseph GeniCamilleMartnez
I never thought that I would be giving my TED Talk somewhere like this
TED
But like half of humanity

I've spent the last four weeks under lockdown

due to the global pandemic created by COVID
COVID
I am extremely fortunate that during this time

I've been able to come here to these woods near my home in southern England

These woods have always inspired me

and as humanity now tries to think about how we can find the inspiration

to retake control of our actions

so that terrible things don't come down the road

without us taking action to avert them

I thought this is a good place for us to talk

And I'd like to begin that story six years ago

when I had first joined the United Nations

Now I firmly believe that the UN is of unparalleled importance

in the world right now

to promote collaboration and cooperation

But what they don't tell you when you join

is that this essential work is delivered

mainly in the form of extremely boring meetings 

extremely long boring meetings

Now you may feel that you have attended some long boring meetings in your life

and I'm sure you have

But these UN meetings are nextlevel

and everyone who works there approaches them with a level of calm

normally only achieved by Zen masters

But myself I wasn't ready for that

I joined expecting drama and tension and breakthrough

What I wasn't ready for

was a process that seemed to move at the speed of a glacier

at the speed that a glacier used to move at

Now in the middle of one of these long meetings

I was handed a note

And it was handed to me by my friend and colleague and coauthor

Christiana Figueres
Christiana Figueres
Christiana was the Executive Secretary
Christiana
of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

and as such had overall responsibility

for the UN reaching what would become the Paris Agreement

I was running political strategy for her

So when she handed me this note

I assumed that it would contain detailed political instructions

about how we were going to get out of this nightmare quagmire

that we seemed to be trapped in

I took the note and looked at it

It said Painful

But let's approach with love

Now I love this note for lots of reasons

I love the way the little tendrils are coming out from the word painful

It was a really good visual depiction of how I felt at that moment

But I particularly love it because as I looked at it

I realized that it was a political instruction

and that if we were going to be successful

this was how we were going to do it

So let me explain that

What I'd been feeling in those meetings was actually about control

I had moved my life from Brooklyn in New York to Bonn in Germany

with the extremely reluctant support of my wife

My children were now in a school where they couldn't speak the language

and I thought the deal for all this disruption to my world

was that I would have some degree of control over what was going to happen

I felt for years that the climate crisis is the defining challenge

of our generation

and here I was ready to play my part and do something for humanity

But I put my hands on the levers of control that I'd been given

and pulled them

and nothing happened

I realized the things I could control were menial daytoday things

Do I ride my bike to work and Where do I have lunch

whereas the things that were going to determine

whether we were going to be successful

were issues like Will Russia wreck the negotiations

Will China take responsibility for their emissions

Will the US help poorer countries deal with their burden of climate change

The differential felt so huge

I could see no way I could bridge the two

It felt futile

I began to feel that I'd made a mistake

I began to get depressed

But even in that moment

I realized that what I was feeling had a lot of similarities

to what I'd felt when I first found out about the climate crisis years before

I'd spent many of my most formative years as a Buddhist monk

in my early s

but I left the monastic life because even then  years ago

I felt that the climate crisis was already a quickly unfolding emergency

and I wanted to do my part

But once I'd left and I rejoined the world

I looked at what I could control

It was the few tons of my own emissions and that of my immediate family

which political party I voted for every few years

whether I went on a march or two

And then I looked at the issues that would determine the outcome

and they were big geopolitical negotiations

massive infrastructure spending plans

what everybody else did

The differential again felt so huge

that I couldn't see any way that I could bridge it

I kept trying to take action

but it didn't really stick

It felt futile

Now we know that this can be a common experience for many people

and maybe you have had this experience

When faced with an enormous challenge

that we don't feel we have any agency or control over

our mind can do a little trick to protect us

We don't like to feel like we're out of control

facing big forces

so our mind will tell us Maybe it's not that important

Maybe it's not happening in the way that people say anyway

Or it plays down our own role

There's nothing that you individually can do so why try

But there's something odd going on here

Is it really true that humans will only take sustained and dedicated action

on an issue of paramount importance

when they feel they have a high degree of control

Look at these pictures

These people are caregivers and nurses

who have been helping humanity face the coronavirus COVID
COVID
as it has swept around the world as a pandemic in the last few months

Are these people able to prevent the spread of the disease

No

Are they able to prevent their patients from dying

Some they will have been able to prevent

but others it will have been beyond their control

Does that make their contribution futile and meaningless

Actually it's offensive even to suggest that

What they are doing is caring for their fellow human beings

at their moment of greatest vulnerability

And that work has huge meaning

to the point where I only have to show you those pictures

for it to become evident

that the courage and humanity those people are demonstrating

makes their work some of the most meaningful things

that can be done as human beings

even though they can't control the outcome

Now that's interesting

because it shows us that humans are capable

of taking dedicated and sustained action

even when they can't control the outcome

But it leaves us with another challenge

With the climate crisis

the action that we take is separated from the impact of it

whereas what is happening with these images

is these nurses are being sustained not by the lofty goal of changing the world

but by the daytoday satisfaction of caring for another human being

through their moments of weakness

With the climate crisis we have this huge separation

It used to be that we were separated by time

The impacts of the climate crisis were supposed to be way off in the future

But right now the future has come to meet us

Continents are on fire

Cities are going underwater

Countries are going underwater

Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move as a result of climate change

But even if those impacts are no longer separated from us by time

they're still separated from us in a way that makes it difficult to feel

that direct connection

They happen somewhere else to somebody else

or to us in a different way than we're used to experiencing it

So even though that story of the nurse demonstrates something to us

about human nature

we're going to have find a different way

of dealing with the climate crisis in a sustained manner

There is a way that we can do this

a powerful combination of a deep and supporting attitude

that when combined with consistent action

can enable whole societies to take dedicated action in a sustained way

towards a shared goal

It's been used to great effect throughout history

So let me give you a historical story to explain it

Right now I am standing in the woods near my home in southern England

And these particular woods are not far from London

Eighty years ago that city was under attack

In the late s

the people of Britain would do anything to avoid facing the reality

that Hitler would stop at nothing to conquer Europe

Fresh with memories from the First World War

they were terrified of Nazi aggression

and would do anything to avoid facing that reality

In the end the reality broke through

Churchill is remembered for many things and not all of them positive

but what he did in those early days of the war

was he changed the story the people of Britain told themselves

about what they were doing and what was to come

Where previously there had been trepidation and nervousness and fear

there came a calm resolve

an island alone

a greatest hour

a greatest generation

a country that would fight them on the beaches and in the hills

and in the streets

a country that would never surrender

That change from fear and trepidation

to facing the reality whatever it was and however dark it was

had nothing to do with the likelihood of winning the war

There was no news from the front that battles were going better

or even at that point that a powerful new ally had joined the fight

and changed the odds in their favor

It was simply a choice

A deep determined stubborn form of optimism emerged

not avoiding or denying the darkness that was pressing in

but refusing to be cowed by it

That stubborn optimism is powerful

It is not dependent on assuming that the outcome is going to be good

or having a form of wishful thinking about the future

However what it does is it animates action

and infuses it with meaning

We know that from that time

despite the risk and despite the challenge

it was a meaningful time full of purpose

and multiple accounts have confirmed

that actions that ranged from pilots in the Battle of Britain

to the simple act of pulling potatoes from the soil

became infused with meaning

They were animated towards a shared purpose and a shared outcome

We have seen that throughout history

This coupling of a deep and determined stubborn optimism with action

when the optimism leads to a determined action

then they can become selfsustaining

without the stubborn optimism the action doesn't sustain itself

without the action the stubborn optimism is just an attitude

The two together can transform an entire issue and change the world

We saw this at multiple other times

We saw it when Rosa Parks refused to get up from the bus
Rosa Parks
We saw it in Gandhi's long salt marches to the beach

We saw it when the suffragettes said that Courage calls to courage everywhere

And we saw it when Kennedy said that within  years

he would put a man on the moon

That electrified a generation and focused them on a shared goal

against a dark and frightening adversary

even though they didn't know how they would achieve it

In each of these cases

a realistic and gritty but determined stubborn optimism

was not the result of success

It was the cause of it

That is also how the transformation happened

on the road to the Paris Agreement

Those challenging difficult pessimistic meetings transformed

as more and more people decided that this was our moment to dig in

and determine that we would not drop the ball on our watch

and we would deliver the outcome that we knew was possible

More and more people transformed themselves to that perspective

and began to work

and in the end that worked its way up into a wave of momentum

that crashed over us

and delivered many of those challenging issues

with a better outcome than we could possibly have imagined

And even now years later and with a climate denier in the White House

much that was put in motion in those days is still unfolding

and we have everything to play for in the coming months and years

on dealing with the climate crisis

So right now we are coming through one of the most challenging periods

in the lives of most of us

The global pandemic has been frightening

whether personal tragedy has been involved or not

But it has also shaken our belief that we are powerless

in the face of great change

In the space of a few weeks

we mobilized to the point where half of humanity took drastic action

to protect the most vulnerable

If we're capable of that

maybe we have not yet tested the limits of what humanity can do

when it rises to meet a shared challenge

We now need to move beyond this narrative of powerlessness

because make no mistake 

the climate crisis will be orders of magnitude worse than the pandemic

if we do not take the action that we can still take

to avert the tragedy that we see coming towards us

We can no longer afford the luxury of feeling powerless

The truth is that future generations

will look back at this precise moment with awe

as we stand at the crossroads between a regenerative future

and one where we have thrown it all away

And the truth is that a lot is going pretty well for us in this transition

Costs for clean energy are coming down

Cities are transforming Land is being regenerated

People are on the streets calling for change

with a verve and tenacity

we have not seen for a generation

Genuine success is possible in this transition

and genuine failure is possible too

which makes this the most exciting time to be alive

We can take a decision right now that we will approach this challenge

with a stubborn form of gritty realistic and determined optimism

and do everything within our power to ensure that we shape the path

as we come out of this pandemic towards a regenerative future

We can all decide that we will be hopeful beacons for humanity

even if there are dark days ahead

and we can decide that we will be responsible

we will reduce our own emissions by at least  percent

in the next  years

and we will take action to engage with governments and corporations

to ensure they do what is necessary coming out of the pandemic

to rebuild the world that we want them to

Right now all of these things are possible

So let's go back to that boring meeting room

where I'm looking at that note from Christiana
Christiana
And looking at it took me back

to some of the most transformative experiences of my life

One of the many things I learned as a monk

is that a bright mind and a joyful heart is both the path and the goal in life

This stubborn optimism is a form of applied love

It is both the world we want to create

and the way in which we can create that world

And it is a choice for all of us

Choosing to face this moment with stubborn optimism

can fill our lives with meaning and purpose

and in doing so we can put a hand on the arc of history

and bend it towards the future that we choose

Yes living now feels out of control

It feels frightening and scary and new

But let's not falter at this most crucial of transitions

that is coming at us right now

Let's face it with stubborn and determined optimism

Yes seeing the changes in the world right now

can be painful

But let's approach it with love

Thank you

I remember watching my father raised the

pistol to my mother's head she pleaded

with him to put the gun down he ignored

her when she bolted toward the door he

followed close behind and once outside

he fired one single shot I was  I

remember this moment frame by frame

I remember feeling numb I remember

feeling alone thank God the bullet

missed her but my family would never be

the same I would never be the same I

didn't know then all the ways that my

parent's onagain offagain relationship

would impact me but I knew I didn't want

to love like theirs my story would be

different

years later when I met you I fell madly

in love our connection was undeniable It

was as if you had been handpicked just

for me

I thought we'd be together forever but

we struggled with some of the same

issues my parents had and after nearly

nine years together we called it quits

we had sake ooh then he was only three

though he was too young to really

understand what was going on he was old

enough to know that mommy and daddy

weren't gonna be living in the same

house anymore our breakup hit me really

hard but I decided I wouldn't let my

broken heart get in the way of what was

best for sake ooh we struggled initially

trying to navigate this new space as

coparents I asked myself how do we

raise this beautiful boy full of wonder

and promise and so much power

in spite of our failures as a couple the

answer for me was simple

I could either choose fear fear of being

alone fear of the unknown or choose love

and I chose love that means seeing the

good in you as a father it means seeing

the good in you as a father and not your

missteps as a partner it means putting

sake who first every time even if it

means I don't get my way I know my

parents went back and forth trying to

work things out for my brothers my

brother and I sake though I appreciate

their effort I wish they hadn't I saw

too much I heard too much I knew I

didn't want that to be sake whose story

I want to say ku to know what it was
Ku
like to see two parents who got along

two parents who worked together as a

team I wanted him to know what love

looks like in its truest form love is

patient love is kind love does not anger

easily keeps no wrongs love always

protects always trusts always hopes

always perseveres

it's  I was  years old I remember

being in the basement with my father and

our home on the east side of Detroit I

watched some stuff albums into the blue

and orange milk crates

I see restrained from his eyes just
restrain
before that his my mother and I him and

my mother had just sat me and my

siblings down and told us that they were

calling it quits  years later I found

myself with tears in my eyes as I packed

my belongings and our home

Devon and I met while I was serving the
Devon
 year prison sentence for four years

we use letters phone calls and visits to

build when we imagine to be an

unshakable bond we fought the system

together and we thought that we would be

able to write the laws of our parents

she was a poet I was a writer she was

gorgeous with a PhD I was handsome with

a GED but we bought something built
GED
something magical we build something

that we thought would endure but

unfortunately our relationship became on

hands when I was released from prison

posttraumatic stress syndrome trauma

from prior to Guana prison baggage from

her relationship my inexperience in a

relationship undid the magic of what we

built behind the laws centered and all

of that was our beautiful boy I remember

we first brought us a cool home it was

so exciting it was amazing we worked

together we collaborated we supported

each other

you took the night shift I took the

morning shift hymns going amazing and

then it all changed it changed the

morning that you came in and really

excited he was like hey I'm going back

to work aren't you excited and I was

like yes I am ecstatic right now

I could not be more delighted but inside

I was really afraid but I can tell you

that so instead I said hey go off and

have a wonderful day and you go and I

was left with say cool what I understand

now about that moment is that we were

fostering the trust that's necessary for

parents to coexist and that you were

trusting me with our most precious gift

and that you were building the

foundation and the blocks for what's

important for this portal we call

Parenthood knowing how our parents

breakups impacted us you know we were

really sensitive about how I break up

what impacts a coowee struggles but we

found our way and let's say coutelle it

were the best parents in the world I

love that he sees us that way we made a

choice in the beginning to coparent as

allies and not adversaries to break the

toxic pattern that we see play out over

and over again when parents lose focus

on what's most important the children

they allow their relationship pain to

get in the way at the end of the day

we're on the same team and that's say

coos team you know I have to admit we

have an unconventional relationship a

lot of people don't understand

we're not perfect as parents or people

but we honor each other's role and sake

whose life we allow him to do things

that our parents would never allow us to

do we don't allow our fears to put

limits on him we nurture his natural

curiosity about the universe and his

relationship to the world remember that

time when we were coming in from a long

day of work and sake who found a puddle

outside a puddle of mud mind you had a

brandnew fresh outfit on leave

from head to toe and he found his puddle

of mud and he reached for it and he

wanted to touch the muddy earth and we

allowed him to do that we resisted the

urge to say no and in fact went and got

him a shovel and allowed him to feel the

Earth's properties and explore as much

as he wanted to and he played and was as

happy as a pig in mud we realized that

the outfit could be washed that a bath

would clean up all the dirt but the

thrill of being in the moment of being

able to touch and and be amazed at this

thing that he had never discovered

before was more valuable than the

clothes or the dirt that could be washed

away we continue to rethink what is

right and wrong when it comes to

parenting sake who challenges us every

day you know we allow him to climb on

couches and draw on his clothes and his

shoes let him run around the store well

I do anyway and I get the death stares

from other Mamas who look at me

and who think that children should be

quiet and wellbehaved in public I also

get those questions that are really

judgements but I don't pay them any mind

because at the end of the day our job is

to guys sake who on this journey of life

not to control him we're here to help

him figure out his place in the world to

uncover his greatest gifts to discover

why he was born we are raising a free

black boy in a world that despises black

joy and we refuse to put limits on him

that the world already has our parenting

can be seen as an allegory but it's

twosided coin the possibilities on one

side the reality of raising a black boy

in a society that says that black boys

black bodies and black lives only seen

as profitable for disposable and then

there's the other side possibility of

two parents who no longer together

coexisting supporting each other

loving each other so affection publicly

in a way that honors the release it with

our son and even more importantly is the

power to support each other know those

vulnerable moments like there was this

one time that it was my day to go pick

up stay cool you remember that time I go

pick Seiko up he's in first grade and as

I'm walking up another parent walks up

and says hey soccer I seen Oprah Winfrey

give a shoutout to you on CNN last
CNN
night she was super excited exuberant

even I was mortified because I thought

what's going to happen when she tells

another parent and they said another

parent and then they go and look me up

and then he discovered that I was in

prison for seconddegree murder and then

a child hears about it and they come to

school and they say to say cool your dad

was convicted of murdering someone and I

remember as watching sake who race out

and I knew that I had to call evany when

I called her explain to her what

happened evany said you have to have the

talk so I took say cold home got him

ready for bed and we talked for half an

hour and I've talked to him about why I

went to prison and I listened to his

feedback and then we called his mom so

we can do our nightly ritual of her

offering prayer and then me doing

affirmations and I remember holding them

tightly and I realized the importance of

the affirmations that we do at night and

I see them as a role map as a guy as a

touchstone for other parents to perfect

protect and empower their children

especially in the world where it's very

difficult for us coparent and there's

so much more than scheduling pick up and

drop off playdates deciding what he's

going to wear what he's going to eat for

us it's about helping each other carry

two weight unpack the low and show up in

the world

the way that honors the beauty of our

Sun and it's for these reasons that we

do affirmations we never thought we'd be

here but here we are and we hope that

the way that we show up for say ku and
ku
for each other is a model of what

successful coparenting can look like

we'd like to bring you all in to this

nightly ritual of affirmations that

shaka does we'll say KU every night at
ShakaKU
bedtime

I am great great I'm awesome I'm awesome

I'm amazing amazing I'm thoughtful and

thoughtful I'm time okay I'm loving I

love I'm Carrie I don't carry no funny

Oh funny I'm smart I'm smart I'm a big

boy big boy I'm a soldier I'm a soldier

I'm warrior I don't say cool I'll take

it

Poet Ali Hi Audience Hi

PA I want to ask you guys a question How many languages do you speak
PA
This is not a rhetorical question

I actually want you to think of a number

For some of you it's pretty easy

Inside your head you're like It's one You're speaking it buddy I'm done

Others of you maybe are wondering

if the language an exboyfriend or exgirlfriend taught you

where you learned all the cusswords

if it counts  go ahead and count it

When I asked myself the question I came up with four

arguably five if I've been drinking

Laughter

In Italian With a little bit of wine I can speak Italian

Applause

Cheers

But on closer examination I came up with    languages

and I got tired and I stopped counting

And it forced me to revisit this definition that we have of language

The first entry said

The method of human communication either spoken or written

consisting of the use of words in a structured or conventional way

The definition at the bottom refers to specialized fields

like medicine science tech

We know they have their own vernacular

their own jargon

But what most interested me was that definition right in the center there

the system of communication used by a particular community or country

And I'm not interested in altering this definition

I'm interested in applying it to everything we do

because I believe that we speak far more languages than we realize

And for the rest of our time together

I'm going to attempt to speak in one language

that is native to every single human being in this room

But that changes things a little bit

because then it's no longer a presentation

It becomes a conversation

and in any conversation

there must be some sort of interaction

And for any interaction to happen

there has to be a degree of willingness on both parties

And I think if we just are willing we will see the magic that can happen

with just a little bit of willingness

So I've chosen a relatively lowrisk common denominator

that can kind of gauge if we're all willing

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands

Claps

Now you're talking

In Spanish For all the people who speak Spanish

please stand up

And look at a person sitting to your side

and start laughing

Laughter

Thank you so much Please be seated

Now if that felt a little bit awkward

I promise there was no joke being had at your expense

I simply asked the Spanishspeaking audience to stand up

look at a person that was sitting close to them and laugh

And I know that wasn't nice and I'm sorry

but in that moment

some of us felt something

You see we're often aware of what language does

when we speak somebody's language

what it does to connect what it does to bind

But we often forget what it does when you can't speak that language

what it does to isolate what it does to exclude

And I want us to hold on as we journey through

our little walk of languages here

In Farsi I'd like to translate the idea of taarof
 taarof
I said in Farsi I'd like to translate

this idea of 'taarof' in the Persian culture
 taarof
which really  it has no equivalent in the English lexicon

The best definition would be something like an extreme grace

or an extreme humility

But that doesn't quite get the job done

So I'll give you an example

If two gentlemen were walking by each other

it'd be very common for the first one to say

In Farsi I am indebted to you

which means I am indebted to you

The other gentlemen would respond back

In Farsi I open my shirt for you

which means I open my shirt for you

The first guy would respond back

In Farsi I am your servant

which means I am your servant

And then the second guy would respond back to him

In Farsi I am the dirt beneath your feet

which literally means I am the dirt beneath your feet

Laughter

Here's an exhibit for you guys in case you didn't get the picture

Laughter

And I share that with you because

with new languages come new concepts that didn't exist before

And the other thing is

sometimes we think language is about understanding the meaning of a word

but I believe language is about making a word meaningful for yourself

If I were to flash this series of words on the screen

some of you you'd know exactly what it is right away

Others of you you might struggle a little bit

And I could probably draw a pretty clearcut line

right around the age of  and older  and younger

And for those of us that are in the know

we know that's textspeak or SMS language
SMS
It's a series of characters meant to convey the most amount of meaning

with the least amount of characters

which sounds pretty similar to our definition of languages

system of communication used by a community

Now anyone who's ever got into an argument via text

can make a case for how it's maybe not the best method of communication

but what if I told you that what you saw earlier

was a modernday love letter

If you follow along

For the time being I love you lots

because you positively bring out all the best in me

and I laugh out loud in other words let's me know what's up

'Cause you are a cutie in my opinion and as far as I know to see you

if you're not seeing someone would make happy

For your information I'll be right there forever

In any case keep in touch no response necessary

all my best wishes don't know don't care if anyone sees this

Don't go there see you later bye for now hugs and kisses

you only live once

Applause

Kind of a modernday Romeo or Juliet

In that moment if you laughed

you spoke another language that needs no explanation laughter

It's one of the most common languages in the world

We don't have to explain it to each other it's just something we all feel

and that's why things like laughter and things like music are so prevalent

because they seem to somehow transcend explanation

and convey a profound amount of meaning

Every language we learn is a portal

by which we can access another language

The more you know the more you can speak

And it's something common that we all do

We take any new concept and we filter it through

an already existing access of reality within us

And that's why languages are so important

because they give us access to new worlds

not just people

It's not just about seeing or hearing it's about feeling experiencing sharing

And despite these languages that we've covered

I really don't think we've covered

one of the most profound languages

and that's the language of experience

That's why when you're talking with someone

if they've shared something you've shared you don't need to explain it much

Or that's why when you're sharing a story and you finish

and the people you're talking to don't quite get it

the first thing we all say is

Guess you had to be there

I guess you had to be here this week to know what this is about

It's kind of hard to explain isn't it

And for the sake of our research I'm going to close by asking

that you participate one more time in this language of experience

I'm going to filter through some languages

and if I'm speaking your language

I'm going to ask that you just stand and you stay standing

You don't need to ask permission

just let me know that you see me

and I can also see you

if you speak this language of experience

Do you speak this language

When I was growing up in primary school

at the end of the year we would have these parties

and we'd vote on whether we wanted to celebrate at an amusement park

or a water park

And I would really hope the party wasn't at a water park

because then I'd have to be in a bathing suit

I don't know about you but sometimes when I approach a dressing room

my sweat glands start activating on their own

because I know the garment is not going to look on me

like it did on that mannequin

Or how about this

When I would go to family functions or family gatherings

every time I wanted a second plate 

and I usually did 

Laughter

it was a whole exercise in costbenefit analysis

my relatives looking at me like

I don't know Do you really need that Looks like you're doing OK there bud

Did my cheeks have a big Pinch me sign that I didn't see
 Pinch me
And if you're squirming or you're laughing or you stood up

or you're beginning to stand

you're speaking the language that I endearingly call

the language of growing up a fat kid

And any bodyimage issue is a dialect of that language

I want you to stay standing

Again if I'm speaking your language please go ahead and stand

Imagine two bills in my hand

One is the phone bill

and one is the electric bill

Eeny meeny miny mo pay one off let the other one go
Eenymeenyminymo
which means I might not have enough to pay both at the current moment

You've got to be resourceful You've got to figure it out

And if you're standing you know the language of barely making ends meet

of financial struggle

And if you've been lucky enough to speak that language

you understand that there is no motivator of greatness like deficiency

Not having resources not having looks not having finances

can often be the barren soil

from which the most productive seeds are painstakingly plowed and harvested

I'm going to ask if you speak this language

The second you recognize it feel free to stand

When we heard the diagnosis

I thought Not that word

Anything but that word

I hate that word

And then you ask a series of questions

Are you sure

Has it spread

How long

Doctor how long

And a series of answers determines a person's life

And when my dad was hungry we'd all rush to the dinner table to eat

because that's what we did before

We ate together so we were going to continue doing that

And I didn't understand why we were losing this battle

because I was taught if you fight and if you have the right spirit

you're supposed to win

And we weren't winning

For any of you that stood up

you know very well that I'm speaking the language

of watching a loved one battle cancer

Applause

Any terminal illness is a derivative of that language

I'm going to speak one last language

Oh  no no I'm listening

Yeah yeah yeah no no no no me and you right here yup

Laughter

No I'm with ya I'm with ya

Laughter

Or imagine the lights are all off and a blue light is just shining in your face

as you're laying on the bed

And I know some of you like me

have dropped that phone right on your face

Laughter

Or this one right

Passenger seat freaking out like Can you watch the road

And for anybody that stood up

you speak the language that I like to call the language of disconnection

It's been called the language of connection

but I like to call it the language of disconnection

I don't mean disconnection I mean disconnection

human disconnection

disconnected from each other

from where we are from our own thoughts

so we can occupy another space

If you're not standing

you probably know what it's like to feel left out

Laughter

Applause

You probably  you know what it's like when everybody's a part of something

and you're not

You know what it's like being the minority

And now that I'm speaking your language

I'm going to ask you to stand

since we're speaking the same language

Because I believe that language of being the minority

is one of the most important languages you can ever speak in your life

because how you feel in that position of compromise

will directly determine how you act in that position of power

Thank you for participating

If you'd take a seat I want to speak one last language

Applause

This one you don't need to stand

I just want to see if you recognize it

Most the girls in the world are complainin' about it

Most the poems in the world been written about it

Most the music on the radio be hittin' about it kickin' about it

or rippin' about it

Most the verses in the game people spittin' about it

most the songs in the world people talkin' about it

Most the broken hearts I know are walkin' without it

started to doubt it

or lost without it

Most the shadows in the dark have forgotten about it

Everybody in the world would be trippin' without it

Every boy and every girl will be dead without it

struggle without it nothing without it

Most the pages that are filled are filled about it

[It  Love]
[ It ]
The tears that are spilled are spilled about it

The people that have felt it are real about it

A life without it you'd be lost

When I'm in it and I feel it I be shoutin' about it

Everybody in the whole world knowin' about it

I'm hurt and broke down and be flowin' about it

goin' about it wrong 'cause I didn't allow it

Can the wound or scar heal without it

Can't the way that you feel be concealed about it

Everybody has their own ideal about it

dream about it

appeal about it

So what's the deal about it

Are you 'bout it to know that life is a dream

and unreal without it

But I'm just a writer

What can I reveal about it

Why is it that the most spokenabout language in the world

is the one we have the toughest time speaking or expressing

No matter how many books how many seminars

how many lifecoaching sessions we go to

we just can't get enough of it

And I ask you now

Is that number that you had at the beginning has that changed

And I challenge you when you see someone

to ask yourself

What languages do we share

And if you don't come up with anything

ask yourself What languages could we share

And if you still don't come up with anything

ask yourself What languages can I learn

And now matter how inconsequential

or insignificant that conversation seems at the moment

I promise you it will serve you in the future

My name is Poet Ali Thank you

Ivana KoromKrystian Aparta
When I was approximately nine weeks pregnant with my first child

I found out I'm a carrier for a fatal genetic disorder

called TaySachs disease

What this means

is that one of the two copies of chromosome number 

that I have in each of my cells

has a genetic mutation

Because I still have one normal copy of this gene

the mutation doesn't affect me

But if a baby inherits this mutation from both parents

if both copies of this particular gene don't function properly

it results in TaySachs

an incurable disease

that progressively shuts down the central nervous system

and causes death by age five

For many pregnant women this news might produce a fullon panic

But I knew something that helped keep me calm

when I heard this bombshell about my own biology

I knew that my husband

whose ancestry isn't Eastern European Jewish like mine

had a very low likelihood

of also being a carrier for the TaySachs mutation
TaySachs
While the frequency of heterozygotes

individuals who have one normal copy of the gene

and one mutated copy

is about one out of  people among Jews of Ashkenazi descent like me

in most populations

only one in about  people carry the TaySachs mutation
TaySachs
Thankfully it turned out I was right not to worry too much

My husband isn't a carrier

and we now have two beautiful and healthy children

As I said

because of my Jewish background

I was aware of the unusually high rate of TaySachs in the Ashkenazi population
AshkenaziTaySachs
But it wasn't until a few years after my daughter was born

when I created and taught a seminar in evolutionary medicine at Harvard

that I thought to ask

and discovered a possible answer to

the question why

The process of evolution by natural selection

typically eliminates harmful mutations

So how did this defective gene persist at all

And why is it found at such a high frequency

within this particular population

The perspective of evolutionary medicine offers valuable insight

because it examines how and why

humans' evolutionary past has left our bodies vulnerable

to diseases and other problems today

In doing so

it demonstrates that natural selection doesn't always make our bodies better

It can't necessarily

But as I hope to illustrate with my own story

understanding the implications of your evolutionary past

can help enrich your personal health

When I started investigating TaySachs using an evolutionary perspective
TaySachs
I came across an intriguing hypothesis

The unusually high rate of the TaySachs mutation
TaySachs
in Ashkenazi Jews today

may relate to advantages the mutation gave this population

in the past

Now I'm sure some of you are thinking

I'm sorry did you just suggest that this diseasecausing mutation

had beneficial effects

Yeah I did

Certainly not for individuals who inherited two copies of the mutation

and had TaySachs

But under certain circumstances

people like me

who had only one faulty gene copy

may have been more likely to survive reproduce

and pass on their genetic material

including that mutated gene

This idea that there can be circumstances in which heterozygotes are better off

might sound familiar to some of you

Evolutionary biologists call this phenomenon

heterozygote advantage

And it explains for example

why carriers of sickle cell anemia

are more common among some African and Asian populations

or those with ancestry from these tropical regions

In these geographic regions malaria poses significant risks to health

The parasite that causes malaria though

can only complete its life cycle in normal round red blood cells

By changing the shape of a person's red blood cells

the sickle cell mutation confers protection against malaria

People with the mutation aren't less likely to get bitten

by the mosquitoes that transmit the disease

but they are less likely to get sick or die as a result

Being a carrier for sickle cell anemia

is therefore the best possible genetic option

in a malarial environment

Carriers are less susceptible to malaria

because they make some sickled red blood cells

but they make enough normal red blood cells

that they aren't negatively affected by sickle cell anemia

Now in my case

the defective gene I carry won't protect me against malaria

But the unusual prevalence of the TaySachs mutation
TaySachs
in Ashkenazi populations

may be another example of heterozygote advantage

In this case increasing resistance to tuberculosis

The first hint of a possible relationship between TaySachs and tuberculosis
TaySachs
came in the s

when researchers published data

showing that among the Eastern Europeanborn grandparents

of a sample of American Ashkenazi children born with TaySachs
TaySachsAshkenazi
tuberculosis was an exceedingly rare cause of death

In fact only one out of these  grandparents

had died of TB

despite the fact that in the early th century

TB caused up to  percent of deaths in large Eastern European cities

Now on the one hand these results weren't surprising

People had already recognized

that while Jews and nonJews in Europe

had been equally likely to contract TB during this time

the death rate among nonJews was twice as high

But the hypothesis that these Ashkenazi grandparents

had been less likely to die of TB

specifically because at least some of them were TaySachs carriers

was novel and compelling

The data hinted

that the persistence of the TaySachs mutation
TaySachs
among Ashkenazi Jews

might be explained by the benefits of being a carrier

in an environment where tuberculosis was prevalent

You'll notice though

that this explanation only fills in part of the puzzle

Even if the TaySachs mutation persisted
TaySachs
because carriers were more likely to survive

reproduce and pass on their genetic material

why did this resistance mechanism proliferate

among the Ashkenazi population in particular
Ashkenazi
One possibility is that the genes and health of Eastern European Jews

were affected not simply by geography

but also by historical and cultural factors

At various points in history

this population was forced to live in crowded urban ghettos

with poor sanitation

Ideal conditions for the tuberculosis bacterium to thrive

In these environments where TB posed an especially high threat

those individuals who were not carriers of any genetic protection

would have been more likely to die

This winnowing effect

together with a strong cultural predilection

for marrying and reproducing only within the Ashkenazi community

would have amplified the relative frequency of carriers

boosting TB resistance

but increasing the incidence of TaySachs as an unfortunate side effect
TaySachs
Studies from the s support this idea

The segment of the American Jewish population

that had the highest frequency of TaySachs carriers
TaySachs
traced their descent

to those European countries where the incidence of TB was highest

The benefits of being a TaySachs carrier were highest

in those places where the risk of death due to TB was greatest

And while it was unclear in the s or 's

how exactly the TaySachs mutation offered protection against TB
TaySachs
recent work has identified

how the mutation increases cellular defenses against the bacterium

So heterozygote advantage can help explain

why problematic versions of genes persist at high frequencies

in certain populations

But this is only one of the contributions evolutionary medicine can make

in helping us understand human health

As I mentioned earlier

this field challenges the notion

that our bodies should have gotten better over time

An idea that often stems from a misconception

of how evolution works

In a nutshell

there are three basic reasons why human bodies

including yours and mine

remain vulnerable to diseases and other health problems today

Natural selection acts slowly

there are limitations to the changes it can make

and it optimizes for reproductive success

not health

The way the pace of natural selection affects human health

is probably most obvious

in people's relationship with infectious pathogens

We're in a constant arms race with bacteria and viruses

Our immune system is continuously evolving to limit their ability to infect

and they are continuously developing ways to outmaneuver our defenses

And our species is at a distinct disadvantage

due to our long lives and slow reproduction

In the time it takes us to evolve one mechanism of resistance

a pathogenic species will go through millions of generations

giving it ample time to evolve

so it can continue using our bodies as a host

Now what does it mean that there are limitations

to the changes natural selection can make

Again my examples of heterozygote advantage

offer a useful illustration

In terms of resisting TB and malaria

the physiological effects of the TaySachs and sickle cell anemia mutations
TaySachs
are good

Taken to their extremes though

they cause significant problems

This delicate balance highlights the constraints

inherent in the human body

and the fact that the evolutionary process

must work with the materials already available

In many instances

a change that improves survival or reproduction

in one sense

may have cascading effects that carry their own risk

Evolution isn't an engineer that starts from scratch

to create optimal solutions to individual problems

Evolution is all about compromise

It's also important to remember

when considering our bodies' vulnerabilities

that from an evolutionary perspective

health isn't the most important currency

Reproduction is

Success is measured not by how healthy an individual is

or by how long she lives

but by how many copies of her genes she passes to the next generation

This explains why a mutation

like the one that causes Huntington's disease

another degenerative neurological disorder

hasn't been eliminated by natural selection

The mutation's detrimental effects

usually don't appear until after the typical age of reproduction

when affected individuals have already passed on their genes

As a whole

the biomedical community focuses on proximate explanations

and uses them to shape treatment approaches

Proximate explanations for health conditions

consider the immediate factors

What's going on inside someone's body right now

that caused a particular problem

Nearsightedness for example

is usually the result of changes to the shape of the eye

and can be easily corrected with glasses

But as with the genetic conditions I've discussed

a proximate explanation only provides part of the bigger picture

Adopting an evolutionary perspective

to consider the broader question of why do we have this problem

to begin with 

what evolutionary medicine calls the ultimate perspective 

can give us insight into nonimmediate factors

that affect our health

This is crucial

because it can suggest ways by which you can mitigate your own risk

or that of friends and family

In the case of nearsightedness

some research suggests

that one reason it's becoming more common in some populations

is that many people today

including most of us in this room

spend far more time reading writing

and engaging with various types of screen

than we do outside interacting with the world on a bigger scale

In evolutionary terms this is a recent change

For most of human evolutionary history

people used their vision across a broader landscape

spending more time in activities like hunting and gathering

The increase in recent years in what's termed near work

focusing intensely on objects directly in front of us

for long periods of time

strains our eyes differently

and affects the physical shape of the eye

When we put all these pieces together

this ultimate explanation for nearsightedness 

that environmental and behavioral change impact the way we use our eyes 

helps us better understand the proximate cause

And an inescapable conclusion emerges 

my mother was right

I probably should have spent a little less time with my nose in a book

This is just one of many possible examples

So the next time you or a loved one are faced with a health challenge

whether it's obesity or diabetes

an autoimmune disorder

or a knee or back injury

I encourage you to think

about what an ultimate perspective can contribute

Understanding that your health

is affected not just by what's going on in your body right now

but also by your genetic inheritance culture and history

can help you make more informed decisions

about predispositions risks and treatments

As for me

I won't claim that an evolutionary medicine perspective

has always directly influenced my decisions

such as my choice of spouse

It turned out though

that not following the traditional practice

of marrying within the Jewish community

ultimately worked in my favor genetically

reducing the odds of me having a baby with TaySachs
TaySachs
It's a great example of why not every set of Ashkenazi parents
Ashkenazi
should hope that their daughter marries a nice Jewish boy

Laughter

Audience Woohoo

More importantly though

the experience of learning about my own genes

taught me to think differently about health in the long run

and I hope sharing my story inspires you to do the same

Thank you

Applause

Picture yourself driving down the road tomorrow

heading somewhere to buy an item you found on Craigslist
Craigslist
perhaps a nice mountain bike for  dollars

At that price it's probably one of those bikes

with a little electric motor on it 

Laughter

maybe some streamers from the handlebars

Laughter

The seller has declared this a cashonly deal

so you have in the console of your car  dollars

Suddenly you are pulled over

During the stop the officer asks

Do you have any drugs weapons or large amounts of cash in your car

You truthfully answer Yes

not to the drugs or to the weapons

but to the cash

In the blink of an eye you are ordered out of your car

The officer searches it and finds your cash

On the spot he seizes it

and he says he suspects it's part of a drug crime

A few days later

the local district attorney files paperwork to keep your money 

permanently

And all of this happens

without you ever being charged or convicted of any crime

Now you might be saying

Ah this would never happen in the United States

Laughter

Incidents like this occur every day in our country

It's one of the most significant threats to your property rights

most people have never even heard of

It's called civil forfeiture

Most of you are generally aware of criminal forfeiture

although the term itself might be a little unfamiliar

so let's begin with forfeiture

When we forfeit something we give up that thing

or we're forced to give it up

In criminal forfeiture

someone is charged and convicted of a crime

and therefore they have to give up property related to that crime

For example suppose you use your car to transport and deal drugs

You're caught and convicted

now you have to give up or forfeit your car

as part of the sentencing

That's criminal forfeiture

But in civil forfeiture no person is charged with a crime 

the property is charged and convicted of a crime

Laughter

You heard that correctly

the government actually convicts an inanimate object with a crime

It's as if that thing itself committed the crime

That's why civil forfeiture cases have these really peculiar names

like The United States of America v One  Ford Thunderbird

Laughter

Or The State of Oklahoma v  Dollars in Cash

Laughter

Or my personal favorite

The United States of America v One Solid Gold Object

in the Form of a Rooster

Laughter

Now you're thinking

How does something like this happen

That's exactly what I said when I first learned about civil forfeiture

while on a road trip with my wife

No we did not get pulled over

Laughter

I was reading about the history of civil forfeiture

as part of my work as a research director at the law firm

and I came across one of the cases I just mentioned

The United States of America v One  Ford Thunderbird

In that case Carol Thomas loaned her car to her son
Carol Thomas
While in the car her son committed a minor drug crime

Carol didn't commit any crime

so law enforcement couldn't convict her and take the car

but they could  and did 

use civil forfeiture to convict the car and take it

Carol was completely innocent but she lost her car nonetheless

In other words

she was punished for a crime she did not commit

When I read this I was gobsmacked

How could this occur

How is this even legal

It turns out it began in our country with maritime law

Early in our republic the government sought to fight piracy 

yes actual pirates

The problem was the government often couldn't catch the pirates

so instead it used civil forfeiture to convict the pirates' property

and take it

and therefore deny the pirates their illegal profits

Of course the government could've simply taken and kept the booty

without necessarily using civil forfeiture

but doing so would have violated

our most basic due process and property rights

Now the government rarely used civil forfeiture until the s

and the war on drugs

We expanded civil forfeiture law to cover drug crimes

and then later other types of crime

Canada and the European Union adopted similar provisions

so that now all kinds of people are ensnared in the forfeiture web

people like Russ Caswell
Russ Caswell
Russ Caswell owned a small budget motel in Tewksbury Massachusetts
Russ CaswellTewksbury
His father built the motel in  and Russ took it over in the s
Russ
During the years that Russ owned the motel

from time to time people would rent rooms

and they would commit drug crimes

Russ didn't condone the activities 

in fact whenever he found out about it he would immediately call police

Russ was entirely innocent of any crime

but that did not stop the US Department of Justice from seizing his motel

simply because other people committed crimes there

But Russ's case was not alone
Russ
Between  and 

the US Department of Justice took more than  properties

This means each year

tens of thousands of people lose their properties

in cases in which they're never charged or convicted of any crime

And we're not necessarily talking about major drug kingpins

or headlinegrabbing financial fraudsters

whose cases involve hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars

Many of these seizures and forfeitures involve just everyday people

like Russ Caswell

or you

or me

But it gets worse

Are you wondering

Where does all this cash and property end up

In most places law enforcement keeps it

And they use it to buy equipment

or pay for building repairs

or even pay salaries and overtime

This is a clear conflict of interest

It creates a perverse profit incentive that can distort law enforcement

And this is a problem that's not lost on those in law enforcement either

Former chief of police in Rochester Minnesota Roger Peterson

described the choice that police officers often face

As he described it

suppose I'm a police officer

and I see a drug deal

Now I face a choice

Do I go after the buyer and remove from the street illegal drugs

or do I go after the seller

and get cash for my agency to use

So it's easy to see why a police officer might go for the cash

It was just such a circumstance

that compelled police officers in Philadelphia to seize an entire house

In  Chris and Markela Sourovelis' son sold  dollars worth of drugs
ChrisMarkela Sourovelis
down the street from their house

Forty dollars

The police watched the deal go down

They could've arrested the buyer and confiscated the drugs

but they didn't

They could've arrested the Sourovelises' son
Sourovelises
right there on the street

and grabbed  dollars

But they didn't

They waited to arrest him at home

because then they could seize their entire house

The house was worth  dollars

That is what I mean by a perverse profit incentive

But the Sourovelises' case was no outlier
Sourovelises
Philadelphia the City of Brotherly Love

the Athens of America

the Cradle of Liberty birthplace to the Constitution

home to the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall

the City that Loves you Back 

Laughter

that Philadelphia was running a forfeiture machine

Between  and 

Philadelphia took more than  million dollars through forfeiture

including  homes

Cars jewelry electronics  all of it they sold

the proceeds they kept

And they would have kept right on doing it

had it not been for a classaction lawsuit 

our team's classaction lawsuit 

Applause and cheers

Thank you

We forced them to change their forfeiture practices

and to compensate victims

Applause and cheers

When our team first began researching forfeiture in 

we had no idea how much forfeiture revenue there was

In fact no one knew

It wasn't until our groundbreaking study Policing for Profit

that we found federal law enforcement agencies have taken in

almost  billion dollars 

billion with a B 
B
since 

more than  percent of that through civil forfeiture

Unfortunately we have no idea

how much state and local agencies have taken in

because in many states they don't have to report it

So until we reform forfeiture

we'll never know how much forfeiture activity actually occurs

in the United States

And we desperately need reform

Legislatures should abolish civil forfeiture

and replace it with criminal forfeiture

And all forfeiture proceeds should go to a neutral fund

such as a general fund

When forfeiture proceeds stop hitting law enforcement budgets directly

that is when we will end policing for profit

Applause

Now as you can imagine

law enforcement officials don't love these recommendations

Laughter

They stand to lose a lot of money

and they believe civil forfeiture is an effective crimefighting tool

The trouble is

it's not

In June  we released a study

that found forfeiture does not improve crimefighting

And the report also found

that law enforcement agencies pursue more forfeiture money

during economic downturns

So when city and county budgets are tight

law enforcement will use forfeiture to find the money

So it's no wonder then

that law enforcement officials predict a criminal apocalypse 

Laughter

if these reforms are adopted

But some states have already implemented them

and we're pushing for reform all across the country

because until we reform forfeiture

this is something that could happen to any of us

It can happen in the United States

it can happen in the United Kingdom

it can happen in countries throughout the European Union

and beyond

People like you and me and the Sourovelises and Russ Caswell
SourovelisesRuss Caswell
just doing the everyday stuff of life

can be caught in a scheme we never thought possible

It is time we end policing for profit

once and for all

Thank you

Applause and cheers

For nearly a decade

my collaborators and I at the SelfAssembly Lab

have been working on material systems that transform themselves

assemble themselves

and adapt to their environment

From our early work on D printing
D
where we printed objects dipped them underwater

and they transform

to our active auxetics that respond to temperature and sunlight

to our more recent work on active textiles

that respond to body temperature and change porosity

to our rapid liquid printing work

where we print inflatable structures

that morph based on air pressure

and go from one shape to another

or our selfassembly work

where we dip objects underwater

they respond to wave energy and assemble themselves

into precise objects like furniture

Or at larger scales

using wind energy

we have meterdiameter weather balloons

that assemble in the airspace above a construction site

For dangerous environments or harsh extreme places

where it's hard to get people or equipment

they can assemble in the airspace and as the helium dies

they then come back to the ground

and you're left with a big space frame structure

All of this research is about taking simple materials

activating them with forces in their environment 

gravity wind waves temperature sunlight 

and getting them to perform

getting them to transform assemble etc

How do we build smart things

without complex electromechanical devices

But more recently we were approached by a group in the Maldives

and they were interested in taking some of this research and ways of thinking

and applying it to some of the challenges that they've faced

in terms of climate change

And the first thing you do

when you're approached by someone in the Maldives

is say you want to go on a site visit

Laughter

It is amazing

So we went there

and I actually walked away with a really different perspective

on the future of climate change

Because you would imagine you know the Maldives are sinking

They're screwed What are they going to do

But I walked away thinking they might be the model

the future model of the built environment where they can adapt and be resilient

rather than our fixed manmade infrastructure

But there's typically three main approaches

to sea level rise and climate change

One of them is that we can do nothing and we can run away

And that's a pretty bad idea

As more than  percent of the world's population

is living in coastal areas

as sea levels rise and as storms get worse and worse

we're going to be more and more underwater

So it's imperative that we solve this pretty demanding problem

The second is that we can build barriers

We can build walls

The problem here is that we take a static solution

trying to fight against a superdynamic highenergy problem

and nature is almost always going to win

So that's likely not going to work either

The third approach is using dredging
ging
So dredging is where you suck up a bunch of sand from the deep ocean

and you pump it back onto the beaches

If you go to any beach around the Northeast or Western Coast

you'll see that they use dredging year after year after year

just to survive

It's really not a good solution

In the Maldives they do the same thing and they can build an island in a month

a brand new island they build from dredging
build
But it's really really bad for the marine ecosystem

and then they become addicted to dredging

They need to do that year after year

But in the time that it took them to build that one island

three sandbars built themselves

and these are massive amounts of sand

so big you can park your boat on it

and this is what's called a site visit

It's really hard work

Laughter

In Boston winters

This is massive amounts of sand that naturally accumulates

just based on the forces of the waves

and the ocean topography

So we started to study that Why do sandbars form

If we could tap into that

we could understand it and we could utilize it

It's based on the amount of energy in the ocean

and the topography in the landscape that promotes sand accumulation

So what we're proposing is to work with the forces of nature

to build rather than destroy

and in my lab at MIT we set up a wave tank

a big tank that's pumping waves

and we placed geometries underwater

We tried all sorts of different geometries

The waves interact with the geometry

and then create turbulence and start to accumulate the sand

so the sand starts to form these sandbars on their own

Here's an aerial view

On the lefthand side you'll see the beach that's growing

In the middle you'll see the sandbar that formed

So these are geometries that collaborate with the force of the wave to build

We then started to fabricate one This was in February in Boston

We have large rolls of canvas

It's a biodegradable material

it's super cheap easy to work with

We then sew it into these large bladders

and then we flew over there

And I know what you're thinking This is not the Fyre Festival
Fyre Festival
Laughter

This is real life It's real

And we flew there with these canvas bladders in our suitcases

we got sunburned because it was Boston winter

and then we filled them with sand and we placed them underwater

These are exactly the same geometries that you saw in the tank

they're just human scale

Large objects filled with sand

we'd place them underwater they're just really simple geometries

In the front of them you'll see it's clear water

The waves are crashing over

It's quite clear

And then on the backside there's turbulence

The water and the sand is mixing up

It's causing sediment transport and then the sand is accumulating

You'll see some friendly stingrays here that visited us

On the left is day one the right is day three

You'll see the sand ripples in the light areas

where the sand is accumulating

just after two days

So this was last February and it's very much ongoing work

This is just in the beginning of this research

Over the next year and longer

we're going to be studying this through satellite imagery

and bathymetry data

to understand what the shortterm and longterm impacts are

of natural sand accumulation in the environment

And the bigger vision though

is that we want to build submersible geometries

almost like submarines that we can sink and float

Like adaptable artificial reefs

you could deploy them

if there's a storm coming from one direction or another

or if the seasons are changing

you can use these adaptable reef structures

to use the force of the waves to accumulate sand

And we think this could be used in many coastal regions

and many island nations around the world

But when we think about building smarter environments

think of smarter buildings or smarter cars or smarter clothing

that typically means adding more power

more batteries more devices more cost more complexity

and ultimately more failure

So we're always trying to think about how do we build smarter things with less

How do we build smarter things that are simple

And so what we're proposing at the lab and with this project specifically

is to use simple materials like sand

that collaborates with forces in the environment like waves

to accumulate and adapt

And we'd like to work with you collaborate with us to develop this

to scale it and apply this way of thinking

We think it's a different model for climate change

one that's about adaptation and resilience

rather than resistance and fear

So help us turn natural destruction into natural construction

Thank you

Chris Anderson I get now to introduce

one of the most powerful women in the world

she is going to play a major part in helping us do that

a delight to welcome here Kristalina Georgieva
Kristalina Georgieva
Kristalina welcome

Kristalina Georgieva Great to be with you Chris
Kristalina GeorgievaChris
Thank you for having me

CA So you just took on this role late last year
CA
and within four months boom COVID arrives
COVID
That is one heck of an introduction to a new job

How are you doing

KG Well I find strength in action
KG
And at the Fund

we have been from day one on this crisis

leaning forward with everything we have

to provide lifelines to countries

and that means to people and businesses

Already we have received over  requests

and we have offered to  countries

critical financial packages

CA You've described this pandemic as a crisis like no other
CA
In what way a crisis like no other

KG Truly like no other
KG
First never before

we will inflict on the economy consciously so much pain

to fight a virus and save lives

We are asking businesses not to produce

and consumers not to go out and consume

At the Fund we labeled this the Great Lockdown

Second

never before

there would be such a rapid change of fortunes

practically for everybody around the world

In January I was in Davos

talking about anemic growth growth of three percent

In April during our spring meetings it was already minus three percent

In January

we predicted  countries to have positive income per capita growth

Now it is  countries with negative income per capita growth

Now this we call the Great Reversal

Very painful

And three uncertainty

We always live with uncertainty Chris

but this time

it is the uncertainty of a novel coronavirus

that policymakers have to integrate

We at the Fund combine epidemiological projections

with our traditional macroeconomic modeling

to see through that uncertainty

I must add to this

I very much hope that when we go on the other side in the recovery

we can use a new term and call it the Great Transformation

Make the world a better place

CA Well I'll be excited to come on to that in a bit
CA
But in this moment of responding to the crisis

the main tool that seems to have been executed

at least by the rich countries

has been this massive economic stimulus

to the tune of trillions of dollars

Is that a wise response

KG It is a necessity
KG
And you don't hear the Fund often telling countries

Please spend

Spend as much as you can

And that is what we do now

We do add to that

And keep the receipts

Don't lose accountability to the citizens to the tax payers

The reason financial injection is necessary

these fiscal measures of almost nine trillion dollars are necessary

is because when the economy is standing still

unless there is help

unless there is monetary policy stimulus

firms are going to go massively bankrupt

people would be unemployed

the economy would be scarred

When we go to the other side

this scarring is going to make the recovery much more difficult

So that is a wise thing to do

and it helps the fact that central banks in major economies

have been acting in a synchronized manner

and that fiscal stimulus came really really fast

This is how we see people being able to go through this

very very tough time

CA But how far can it go
CA
Because it's been described in a sense as printing money 

governments are issuing more and more bonds

that have to paid back at some point

There's this term in economics of the Minsky moment

where things can go very well for a while

as everyone believes that you know

that the train can keep running

the cycle can keep turning

you know that governments have all this money

At some point though doesn't that break down

Do you worry that we may be nearing a Minsky moment

where like Michael in Mary Poppins

grabs his tuppence and starts a run on the bank

Is there stress in the international financial system now

that concerns you

that makes you feel that we may be running out of headroom

KG Of course this cannot go on forever
KG
I for one have trust in our scientists

I think we will see breakthroughs

and we will see also people in businesses

getting accustomed to social distancing

to micromeasures that protect from spreading the disease

We have seen very massive injection in health systems

so hospitals can actually treat people that are coming for help

Obviously if it is to go for a very long time

we would be worried

For now

what we are projecting

is that there would be a gradual reopening 

we see it already happening in a number of countries

And we project for next year 

a partial recovery

Not a full recovery unfortunately

but coming to a better place

Now what helps us

is something that I don't particularly love

but I see it as a positive feature 

very low interest rates

in some cases negative 

that allows this injection of fiscal measures and liquidity

to be sustained over a number of years

And for now we do not see on the horizon

any return to increase in interest rates

So low for longer

and that is in that environment a helpful feature

CA I mean the financial crisis of 
CA
came perilously close to breaking the entire financial system 

arguably it did that

By most people's calculation

this is a far worse impact to the economy overall

Did the world learn something from 

that has helped us so far be resilient this time

KG What the world learned is that the financial system
KG
has to be tested

and then strengthened to withstand shocks

And that is helping us tremendously today

The banking system is resilient

and even in the nonbanking financial institutions

there is more attention paid

to how far can you go without running into trouble

I would say

if you look around the world

the most important lesson then was build resilience to shocks

Those who have done it cope now better

And those who have not done it are in a much tougher spot

And actually for the Fund

what we are praying

is that we will come out of this crisis with this lesson about resilience

being spread beyond the banking system

so we actually have this crisismanagement mindset

for a world that is inevitably going to be more shockprone

because of climate

and also because of the sheer density of economic and social life on our planet

CA In your role
CA
you're paying special attention to the situation in developing countries

And it does seem that they're facing a really terrible situation right now

Many of them have significant debt denominated in dollars

In the current crisis

their currencies are depreciating against the dollar

making it nigh impossible for them to execute the kind of injection

stimulus injections

that the rich countries are doing

and seems to be the only way out

So that seems like a really dangerous cycle

Is there any way to break that cycle

KG Well let me first separate
KG
countries that have built strong fundamentals

And now in this crisis

as we are receiving incoming data

not very many but there are still some positive surprises

and they come from countries that have built stronger buffers

stronger fundamentals

have been more disciplined during good times

But indeed we do see

quite a number of emerging markets developing countries

faced with multiple pressures

They had the hit from the coronavirus

many of them with weak health systems

Then they have the high level of indebtedness

from before the crisis

which creates a much more difficult environment for them

Then many of them are commodity exporters

Commodity prices oil price

they went down very dramatically

that hits them again

Many rely on remittances

Remittances shrunk some  to  percent

And then you have a number of countries that are highly dependent on tourism

Tourism is the hardest hit sector or one of the hardest hit

So very tough for these countries

but this is why institutions like mine have been wisely created

The IMF the World Bank the regional development banks

we work very closely together in this crisis

The IMF fortunately

that was one of the lessons from the  crisis 

make sure that in the center of the financial safety net is an IMF
IMF
with financial strength

We have four times more money to lend today

than we had then

From  billion to one trillion dollars

And of course

we are deploying these funds

exactly for the countries that need us the most

And we did one more thing

With David Malpass the president of the World Bank
David Malpass
we called for a debt moratorium for the poorest countries

to their official bilateral creditors

And people tend to say Oh we don't work together

it's not good enough

But here is an area where we made this call in late March

and in midApril

the G agreed on this moratorium
G
Amazing we had the Paris Club China

the Gulf countries

all agreeing that we should not suffocate the poorest countries

by asking them to pay their debts

when their economies are standing still

CA Is it possible that some developing countries
CA
are overdoing the lockdown policy

I mean if large numbers of your citizens are already struggling to stay alive

isn't it almost like a death sentence to order them not to leave their homes

KG Well Chris one of the most heartbreaking conversations I would have
KG
is with leaders of countries where they have to stare in the face

a choice of people dying from the virus

or dying from hunger

And it is a very dramatic situation for them

Where you have a very large part of your economy

being informal

where people live handtomouth every day

the lockdowns we have in advanced economies

are not quite applicable

but even there

countries are doing really well in social distancing

to the extent it is possible

Many of the countries in Africa

were very early to step up preventive measures

Why

They learned from the Ebola they learned from prior crises

that hygiene

taking any measure you can really helps

So again I cannot stress enough

how important is solidarity with these countries

How important it is for my institution to be there for them in a timely manner

And we do it

CA Whitney
CA
Whitney Pennington Rogers Hi there thank you

this is a wonderful conversation

and we're starting to see some questions coming from the community

The first one we have is from Bill Elkus
Bill Elkus
and it's a followup to something you were mentioning earlier

related to the stimulus Kristalina
Kristalina
What are the prospects for inflation from such a large stimulus

KG At this point
KG
we are not worried about inflation in advanced economies

and in the majority of emerging market economies

We do worry about inflation

in countries that have weak fundamentals

no access to foreign exchange easily

where the only way to address the crisis

is our help

or their central banks printing more money

And sometimes it's a combination of those two

Why I don't worry about inflation in advanced economies

Because countries that have their hard currency

are putting liquidity in place

but at the same time

they're not seeing a big expansion of demand

and prices being pushed up

So for these countries

at least for the observable future

we don't see a way of going like after the Second World War

in inflation jumping up

The consumers are not consuming so aggressively

demand is not that strong

and these are societies where there is a lot of maturity

in how they exercise their policy options

But if you are a poor country

that out of desperation with no access to markets

no access to hard currency

ought to somehow put money supply enough

then inflation is going to be there

A very extreme case is Zimbabwe

and I do worry there may be other countries

So this is why we are so determined to engage with these countries early

And also look at some of the highdebt countries

Would it be necessary on a countrybycountry basis

to restructure debts

to prevent that moving in a desperate direction

WPR Thank you
WPR
And we have one more question that I wanted to share from our community

This is from Keith Yamashita

and it's about how we all can be involved in some of this change

You are tasked with macroeconomic and funding efforts

What should we do as citizens to help renewal and recovery

KG Well it is incredibly important for all of us citizens 
KG
and aside of being the head of the IMF I am also a global citizen 
IMF
that we are to bring that notion

of solidarity in a moment of crisis

I loved the way this segment

was musically backed and it was Lean on Me

It is very important that we do create that sense 

we are in this together we will get through it together

And please speak up on that

I was for many years crisis commissioner

and one thing I learned is that the majority of people

are positive good people

You can lean on them

And there is a minority that is hateful and fearful

and also very loud

So good people speak up

Spread that sense of we are in this together

we'll get through it together

WPR Thank you I'll come back later with other questions
WPR Thank you I'll come back later with other questions
CA Kristalina I'd love to expand on that
CAKristalina
and just ask you a bit more about leadership actually

You know when people think of the nations that have performed best

they often refer to 

when I say best best in response to the current pandemic 

they often refer to Germany New Zealand

South Korea Taiwan Denmark and Norway

When they think of those that have performed worst

they often think of Spain Italy the UK Belgium

Sweden Iran Brazil Russia

and the United States

All of that second group are run by men

all but one of the first group are run by women

Is that a coincidence

KG Well now
KG
speaking a bit subjectively as a woman

I do believe that women are great to lead in a crisis

They are more likely to show empathy

to care about the most vulnerable people

and to be able to speak about that

They are decisive

I can say that for myself

we take energy from action

And we don't tend to kind of mourn and complain

too much

So there is perhaps something to be said

about the value of gender equality for the future

Bring more women for this world of more crisis ahead of us

CA It's obviously hard to make generalizations about gender of any kind
CA
but I mean is there also almost something

about the embracing of nuance

that women might be better at that than men

Men are often it's like let's win let's conquer

and in a situation like this where it's all probabilities

it's like there are so many complex dials to turn

on this dangerous pandemic machine that we're trying to wrestle

I mean are women better at handling nuance

KG Let me say something Chris
KG
We need everybody

and we need this mixture of experience knowledge and predisposition

Men and women coming together

I find it that it is great to have different perspectives

when we make decisions

Then the chances of making a good decision are higher

So we need each other

but we also need to recognize is that yes there are certain things

I have seen it time and again

women are more willing to find a pathway to compromise

they're more willing to be corrected if they're wrong

Say Oh OK that's a good point

let me integrate it in the way I think about it

And when you are in uncertainty

that is a huge advantage in decisionmaking

CA So perhaps talk a bit more about your own leadership in this moment
CA
I mentioned you've only recently come to this job

Before that you were European Commissioner

you dealt with humanitarian crises in more than one part of the world

And in your own country Bulgaria

you witnessed the wholesale transformation of the country

both politically and economically

What lessons can you bring from your past experience

to this moment

KG Well there are many things I learned
KG
I was very fortunate to have these multiple experiences

for the job I have now

But let me highlight three

First how critically important it is

to prepare for a crisis

Kind of think of the unthinkable

and then act with some foresight

when a shock hits you

You have a title for this series called Build Back Better
 Build Back Better
I actually would like to modify it if I may

and I would talk about Build Better Before

Preparedness prevention pay off big time

The second 
  
and not necessarily in priority it is as important 

is collective action

working together

Seeking help offering help

Makes a huge difference in an emergency

And the third is something I learned time and again

We don't know our internal strength

until we are hit

We are so resilient

we are so able to withstand shocks

especially when we come together

that this always gives me this sense of optimism

that as hard as it is we can overcome it

From the days when my country collapsed the economy collapsed

I would get up at four o'clock in the morning

queue to buy milk for my daughter

to the days when I would see Syrian refugees in terrible situations

helping each other

to today when I'm the head of the IMF

that internal strength

our power of resilience

the more we are together

the more it is amplified

CA Actually could you talk a bit more about the role of the IMF
CAIMF
especially as we look forward to trying to recover from this

What specifically can your organization do

to take us forward

KG So there are three things that are quite unique for the IMF
KGIMF
and they're really so important in a time of crisis

The first one is to give a good diagnostic of what is happening

and what is the way forward

Let me just say in this crisis

in the very first weeks

we put together we call it policy action tracker for  countries

What actions are countries taking

how they can learn from each other

so we can be more effective together

We are adding to it now

actions for responsible reopening of the economies

exactly with that purpose

What we are known best for

we are the financial first responder

We are coming in this incredible shock

with very significant financial firepower

And what people don't know is that the Fund has multiple instruments

Emergency financing is the one we doubled for this crisis

And it is no conditionalities

We are asking one thing Chris

Pay your doctors and your nurses your hospitals

protect your most vulnerable people and parts of the economy

That's it this is the condition

And the third thing we do at the Fund

is to help countries have the capacity for good policies

After the financial crisis

we helped many countries to have good debt management

good fiscal management

transparency and accountability

to improve the performance of public finance

So the Fund is not a very big organization

by any standard

we are some  people

Highly professional incredibly committed

When you use the expression all hands on deck that's us

And it is a digital deck

it is a digital deck these days

CA I mean this is a global crisis
CA
A lot of people are worried that unlike perhaps even in 

where it really did seem there was a lot of global cooperation

there's actually in some worrying ways

less this time

Are you worried about

how crucial is that to getting us through this

KG I mean my preoccupation is
KG
in our mandate in my area of responsibility

bring the membership together

We have almost the whole world

 countries are our members

and so far I am very impressed by how responsive the membership has been

I put in front of them in the spring

a package very strong package of measures

to expand the role of the IMF in the crisis

Everything that we ask for 

we ask for doubling emergency financing

we got it

Very interesting

We ask for tripling concession of financing

Exactly because you know

like the virus hits people with a weak system the hardest

the crisis hits weak economies the hardest

So we wanted to triple concession of financing

Within one month we got it

We asked for grants for debt relief

we got it

So what I'm trying to say here is that we need to focus

on ways in which we bring the world together

And then act on that

Rather than complaining

that maybe not everything is the way it should be

do your duty to the global community

CA Well indeed
CA
And the IMF is dependent on the financing from its members

its key members

KG Yes
KG
CA I mean you spoke of the trillion dollars
CA
that you are looking to make available to nations that need it

As I read it that comes from 

you've got these units called Special Drawing Rights

You basically draw a currency from members

And hasn't there been pushback though from the US

to block that effort of raising all that money

KG So the one trillion dollars is from our quotas
KG
and also from our ability to move money

from welltodo members from the advanced economies

and lend it at very low or zero interest

to the developing emerging markets

And we had this one trillion

and what was very interesting not everybody noticed that 

the US in their two trillion dollars stimulus package

included the support for the IMF
IMF
The Special Drawing Rights

is something that we indeed

don't have yet consensus among the membership to do

It was done during the  crisis

issuing liquidity

and it goes to everybody

And there are many voices including mine 

I spoke to the G about that 
G
that are saying well that may be a good thing to do now

It is not being supported for reasons

It is not just capriciously

The problem with Special Drawing Rights is that when we issue them

they go to all members

and the advanced economies get  percent of the new allocation

and there are some that are saying

Can we think of something that is more directed

or exclusively directed to those who need it

But Chris everything is on the table for us

As the crisis unfolds

we need to do more we bring the membership to do more

CA Whitney
CA
WPR We actually have a question from the community
WPR
that builds on what you're discussing right now

Yavnika Khanna asks
Yavnika Khanna
Which countries will prove to be resilient in the Great Transformation

those with popular leaders or those with sound financial systems

KG You know they both matter
KG
Countries with strong fundamentals

are clearly going through this crisis

with less trauma than those that had weak fundamentals to begin with

And of course leadership matters

How you mobilize a country for action matters

In my view what we would see on the other side

the winners would be those who think today of this crisis

also as an opportunity

Clearly digital transformation is a huge opportunity

Moving to elearning egovernment

epayments ecommerce

linking small and mediumsized enterprises

through digital to consumers

big winner

Secondly I very much hope

that we would come on the other side

with a low carbon footprint

and a more climateresilient economy

Those who move in this direction

they would reduce the risk for themselves and the world

From this other crisis

that we are not talking so much about these days

but it hasn't gone anywhere

And you know if you don't like pandemic

you are not going to like the climate crisis at all

And also countries that are thinking

of how to make the economy in the future

a fairer economy

In other words

we have been seeing inequality building up before this crisis

My colleagues who have researched pandemics

have a very bitter lesson for us

After pandemics

after HN
HN
after SARS after Zika
SARSZika
inequality goes up

Well are we going to let inequality to go up up

after this crisis

And if we do

we are damaging the fabric of our societies

and my sense is that hundreds of millions of people in this crisis

would much prefer to have a simpler fairer

more equitable world to live in

and definitely a more sustainable world

CA Mm
CA
KG Those would be the winners
KG
WPR Definitely
WPR
And just one more question from our community

before turning it back to Chris for some final questions here
Chris
You know this one is from Sarah Rugheimer
Sarah Rugheimer
And the question is

What do you see as the main potential positive shifts  changes

in this world

from this pandemic say two to  years from now

KG Well I touched upon it a little bit
KG
First I hope to see fiscal policy

to help us recover

to be geared towards green recovery

and more equitable recovery

And that is something that is in the hands of policymakers

It can be done

Secondly I very much hope to see us

integrating what we have learned from the crisis

in terms of virtual work

My organization the IMF
IMF
well we can shrink our carbon footprint dramatically

just by sustaining the practices we are developing now

and we will

I certainly hope to see in the future

much more attention to two things that we saw in this crisis are essential

Universal access to health in some form

strong health systems

as well as strong social safety nets

built as automatic stabilizers in a time of shock

And by the way it is cheaper if we do it in this way

The bill for everyone is going to be smaller

And also I very much hope that this notion of investing in people

recognizing that now that we see this horrible tragedy

the loss of lives

that investing in people is the very best investment we can make

CA Mm
CA
WPR That's great
WPR
CA So see you again in a minute Whitney
CA
Kristalina it's so 

It's so inspiring actually hearing the energy and stuff

the energy that you're bringing to this

I don't think many people coming into this

would have expected to hear from the head of the IMF

this emphasis on you know

Let's solve the climate crisis

let's tackle inequality and injustice

Do you really believe that this moment

this crisis could help lead us into a great transformation

People will feel it's your job to sound positive

you have to do that

Do you really see the path forward that we can get through this

and what sort of timescale are we talking about here Kristalina

KG Well you know one thing I learned from the transition I lived through
KG
the transition from central planning to markets

is it is tough it is long it is painful

and it is a road that takes turns

So I don't have an expectation of miracle from here to there

But I genuinely believe that we are now

in a point of our history

when people demand from their leaders

safety and security

and a society that is not torn apart by conflicts

And that is actually not unusual to see

So I would turn the table a little bit on you Chris

After a war

we see the world coming together

and building a better world

Why not after a pandemic

And yes

we can make mistakes and not take the right road to travel

But we certainly have an obligation to try to get on that road

CA So if you could just inject 
CA
KG And everybody matters for that
KG
CA So if you could inject one idea into the mind of everybody
CA
or into to the world leaders who listen to you

what would that idea be at this moment

KG Optimism
KG
Build a better world

Possible desirable we must do it

CA That sounds like optimism as the stance
CA
not just a naive belief that it will happen

but a determination to make it so

That's what you're calling for

To use that as the motivation to pull us all forward together

KG Chris do I have one minute or I'm done I need to go
KG
CA If you want to say one last thing in one minute alright go
CA
KG I want to say one thing
KG
To recommend to the audience to watch the movie

Bridge of Spies

There is a part in the movie

in which the two main actors

the lawyer and the Russian spy talk to each other

The lawyer says Things are very bad it looks like you may hang

The spy is very calm

Lawyer says Aren't you worried

The spy answers Would it help

So my message is it is tough

but worries won't help

Positive action will

Positive stay positive so that's my message

CA Well I have to say thank you
CA
It's incredibly inspiring actually to see your energy

and your determined optimism let's call it that

I think we wish you the very best

as you use your position to help get us out of this mess

Thank you so much Kristalina for spending time here at TED
KristalinaTED
Thank you

WPR Thank you Kristalina
WPR
So how are we going to beat this novel coronavirus

By using our best tools

our science and our technology

In my lab we're using the tools of artificial intelligence

and synthetic biology

to speed up the fight against this pandemic

Our work was originally designed

to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis

Our project seeks to harness the power of machine learning

to replenish our antibiotic arsenal

and avoid a globally devastating postantibiotic era

Importantly the same technology can be used

to search for antiviral compounds

that could help us fight the current pandemic

Machine learning is turning the traditional model of drug discovery

on its head

With this approach

instead of painstakingly testing thousands of existing molecules

one by one in a lab

for their effectiveness

we can train a computer to explore the exponentially larger space

of essentially all possible molecules that could be synthesized

and thus instead of looking for a needle in a haystack

we can use the giant magnet of computing power

to find many needles in multiple haystacks simultaneously

We've already had some early success

Recently we used machine learning to discover new antibiotics

that can help us fight off the bacterial infections

that can occur alongside SARSCoV infections
SARSCoV
Two months ago TED's Audacious Project approved funding for us
TEDAudacious Project
to massively scale up our work

with the goal of discovering seven new classes of antibiotics

against seven of the world's deadly bacterial pathogens

over the next seven years

For context

the number of new class of antibiotics

that have been discovered over the last three decades is zero

While the quest for new antibiotics is for our mediumterm future

the novel coronavirus poses an immediate deadly threat

and I'm excited to share that we think we can use the same technology

to search for therapeutics to fight this virus

So how are we going to do it

Well we're creating a compound training library

and with collaborators applying these molecules to SARSCoVinfected cells
SARSCoV
to see which of them exhibit effective activity

These data will be use to train a machine learning model

that will be applied to an in silico library of over a billion molecules

to search for potential novel antiviral compounds

We will synthesize and test the top predictions

and advance the most promising candidates into the clinic

Sound too good to be true

Well it shouldn't

The Antibiotics AI Project is founded on our proof of concept research
AI
that led to the discovery of a novel broadspectrum antibiotic

called halicin

Halicin has potent antibacterial activity
Halicin
against almost all antibioticresistant bacterial pathogens

including untreatable panresistant infections

Importantly in contrast to current antibiotics

the frequency at which bacteria develop resistance against halicin
halicin
is remarkably low

We tested the ability of bacteria to evolve resistance against halicin
halicin
as well as Cipro in the lab
Cipro
In the case of Cipro
Cipro
after just one day we saw resistance

In the case of halicin

after one day we didn't see any resistance

Amazingly after even  days

we didn't see any resistance against halicin
halicin
In this pilot project we first tested roughly  compounds against E coli

This training set included known antibiotics

such as Cipro and penicillin
Cipro
as well as many drugs that are not antibiotics

These data we used to train a model

to learn molecular features associated with antibacterial activity

We then applied this model to a drugrepurposing library

consisting of several thousand molecules

and asked the model to identify molecules

that are predicted to have antibacterial properties

but don't look like existing antibiotics

Interestingly only one molecule in that library fit these criteria

and that molecule turned out to be halicin
halicin
Given that halicin does not look like any existing antibiotic
halicin
it would have been impossible for a human including an antibiotic expert

to identify halicin in this manner
halicin
Imagine now what we could do with this technology

against SARSCoV
SARSCoV
And that's not all

We're also using the tools of synthetic biology

tinkering with DNA and other cellular machinery
DNA
to serve human purposes like combating COVID
COVID
and of note we are working to develop a protective mask

that can also serve as a rapid diagnostic test

So how does that work

Well we recently showed

that you can take the cellular machinery out of a living cell

and freezedry it along with RNA sensors onto paper
RNA
in order to create lowcost diagnostics for Ebola and Zika
Zika
The sensors are activated when they're rehydrated by a patient sample

that could consist of blood or saliva for example

It turns out this technology is not limited to paper

and can be applied to other materials including cloth

For the COVID pandemic
COVID
we're designing RNA sensors to detect the virus
RNA
and freezedrying these along with the needed cellular machinery

into the fabric of a face mask

where the simple act of breathing

along with the water vapor that comes with it

can activate the test

Thus if a patient is infected with SARSCoV
SARSCoV
the mask will produce a fluorescent signal

that could be detected by a simple inexpensive handheld device

In one or two hours a patient could thus be diagnosed

safely remotely and accurately

We're also using synthetic biology

to design a candidate vaccine for COVID
COVID
We are repurposing the BCG vaccine
BCG
which had been used against TB for almost a century

It's a live attenuated vaccine

and we're engineering it to express SARSCoV antigens
SARSCoV
which should trigger the production of protective antibodies

by the immune system

Importantly BCG is massively scalable
BCG
and has a safety profile that's among the best of any reported vaccine

With the tools of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence

we can win the fight against this novel coronavirus

This work is in its very early stages but the promise is real

Science and technology can give us an important advantage

in the battle of human wits versus the genes of superbugs

a battle we can win

Thank you

Transcriber Joseph Geni Reviewer Camille Martnez
Joseph GeniCamilleMartnez
Helen Walters Huang it's so good to see you

Thank you for joining us How's your  been

Huang Hung My  started totally normal

In January I went to Paris

did my interview for the fashion week there

came back to Beijing on January nd

and finding things a little bit tense

because there were a lot of rumors

Having lived through SARS

I wasn't that concerned

And on the rd I had a friend of mine from New York come to my house

who had a flu

and we had dinner together

and another friend who came

who left the next day for Australia for vacation on an airplane

So we were not taking this terribly seriously

until there was a lockdown

HW And we've seen that echo around the world

I think still some people find it hard to understand the magnitude

of some of the measures that China took

I mean  what else are we missing about China's response in all of this

HH You know historically
HH
we're just two very different countries

in terms of culture and history

I mean these are two completely different human experiences for its people

So for China

when the lockdown happens

people are OK

People are OK with it

because they think that's what a good parent should do

You know if a kid gets sick

you put him in the other room

and you lock him up and make sure that the other kids don't get sick

And they expect that out of the government

But when it is outside of China from America it becomes a huge issue

of the right political thing to do

and whether it's infringing on personal freedom

So the issues that you have to deal with in a democratic society

are issues that one does not have to deal with in China

I have to say that there's a word in Chinese

that doesn't exist in any other language

and the word is called gui
gui
It is what you call a kid

who listens to his or her parents

So I think as a people we are very gui
gui
We have this sort of authoritarian figure

that Chinese always look up to

and they do expect the government to actually take the actions

and they will deal with it

However much suffering there is

they feel that OK if big brother says that this has to be done

then it must be done

And that really defines China as a separate mentality

Chinese has a separate mentality

as say people in Europe and America

HW That sense of collective responsibility

sometimes feels a little absent from this culture

At the same time there are I think valid concerns

around surveillance and data privacy things like that

What is the balance here

and what is the right tradeoff between surveillance and freedom

HH I think in the internet age
HH
it is somewhere between China and the US

I think when you take individual freedom

versus collective safety

there has to be a balance somewhere there

With surveillance the head of Baidu Robin Li once said

the Chinese people are quite willing to give up certain individual rights

in exchange for convenience

Actually he was completely criticized on Chinese social media

but I think he is right

Chinese people are willing to give up certain rights

For example we have 

Chinese mostly are very proud of the payment system we have

which is you can go anywhere just with your iPhone
iPhone
and pay for everything

and all they do is facescan

I think that probably freaks Americans out

You know China right now we're still under semilockdown

so if you go anywhere there's an app where you scan

and you input your mobile phone number

and the app will tell the guard at the entrance of the mall for example

where you have been for the past  days

Now when I told that to an American

she was horrified

and she thought it was such an invasion of privacy

On the other hand

as someone who is Chinese

and has lived in China for the past  years

although I understand that American mentality

I still find I'm Chinese enough to think I don't mind this

and I am better I feel safer entering the mall

because everybody has been scanned

whereas I think individual freedom as an abstract concept

in a pandemic like this

is actually really meaningless

So I think the West really needs to move a step towards the East

and to think about the collective as a whole

rather than only think about oneself as an individual

HW The rise of antagonistic rhetoric between the US and China

is obviously troubling

and the thing is the countries are interlinked

whether people understand global supply chains or not

Where do you think we head next

HH You know this is the most horrifying thing that came out of this
HH
the kind of nationalistic sentiments on both sides in this pandemic

Because I'm an optimist

I think what will come out of this

is that both sides will realize that this is a fight

that the entire human race has to do together and not apart

Despite the rhetoric

the global economy has grown to such an integration

that decoupling will be extremely costly and painful

for both the United States and China

HW It's also been interesting to me

to see the criticism that China has received quite vocally

For instance they've been criticized for downplaying the death toll

arguably

also for trying to demonize Dr Li

the Wuhan doctor who first raised the alarm about the coronavirus

I just saw a report in The New York Times

that Weibo users have been posting repeatedly on the last post of Dr Li

and using this as kind of a living memorial to him

chatting to him

There's something like  comments and growing

on that last post

Do you see a change in the media

Do you see a change in the approach to Chinese leadership

that actually could lead to China swinging perhaps more to the center

just as perhaps America needs to swing more towards a Chinese model

HH Unfortunately not really
HH
because I think there is a way

between authoritarian governments and its people to communicate

The night that Dr Li died

when it was announced that he died

the Chinese social media just blew up

Even though he was unjustly treated as a whistleblower

he still went to work in the hospital

and tried to save lives as a doctor

and then he died

because he contracted the disease

So there was anger frustration

and all of that came out

in kind of commemorating a figure

that they feel that the government had wronged

The verdict

and sort of the official voice on

Who is Dr Li Is he a good guy or a bad guy

completely changed  degrees

He went from a doctor who misbehaved

to the hero who warned the people

So under authoritarian government

they still are very aware of public opinion

but on the other hand

when people complain and when they commemorate Dr Li

do they really want to change the system

And my answer is no

because they don't like that particular decision

but they don't want to change the system

And one of the reasons is because

they have never ever known another system

This is the system they know how to work

HW What is wokthrowing Huang

HH Oh wokthrowing is when you blame somebody else
HH
Basically someone who is responsible in a slang Chinese
Chinese
is someone who carries a black wok

You are made to be the scapegoat for something that is bad

So basically Trump started calling it the Chinese virus

the Wuhan virus

and trying to blame the entire coronavirus pandemic

on the Chinese

And then the Chinese I think threw the wok back at the Americans

So it was a very funny joke on Chinese social media

that wokthrowing

There's a wokthrowing gymnastics aerobics exercise video that went viral

HW But tell us Huang

You're also doing dances on TikTok right
TikTok
HH Oh of course
HH
I'm doing a lot of wokthrowing aerobics on TikTok
TikTok
HW I mean a potential silver lining of all of this is that it has laid bare

some of the inequities inequalities in the system

some of the broken structures that we have

and if we're smart we can rebuild better

HH Yes I think one of the silver linings of this pandemic
HH
is that we do realize

that the human race has to do something together

rather than to be distinguished by our race by the color of our skin

or by our nationality

that this virus obviously is not discriminating against anyone

whether you are rich or poor

important or not important

or whatever skin color or nationality you are

So it is a time to be together

rather than to try to pull the world apart

and crawl back to our own nationalistic shells

HW It's a beautiful sentiment

Huang Hung thank you so much for joining us from Beijing

Stay well please

HH Thank you Helen and you stay well as well
HHHelen
Stress  we all know what it is and we all handle it differently

Whether it's our thoughts speeding up or slowing down

eating our emotions or not at all

difficulty sleeping or just getting out of bed

Frankly it sucks

Laughter

But there's good stress too you know

like preparing for the biggest public speaking event you've ever given

Laughter

Applause

On a global platform

Laughter

No even the good stress can mess with you

but it's the bad stress that I came to talk about

And probably not for the reason you'd expect

I'm a relationship manager for affluent individuals

Meaning I work with wealthy folks and their families hip to hip

helping them achieve their financial goals

I like to keep the economy in mind because I know

that whatever impacts the economy impacts my clients

and it turns out stress is impacting the economy in a massive way

What if I told you that by some estimates

the cost of workrelated stress in the US is close to  billion dollars annually

Workplace stress the stress causing this massive impact

is related to productivity and wellness

Today that's what we're here to talk about

And by the way it's linked to employee disengagement

chronic diseases that impact your work

and workrelated injuries and illnesses

And when you add up the cost of all five factors

it's an estimated  trillion dollars annually

That represents  percent of our GDP
GDP
Now I know what you're thinking That is a lot of money and how

Stress is this deeply personal thing

it's crazy to think it can have such a massive impact

But consider this thought experiment to explain how

Imagine a single mother working a stressful job

in a stressfilled environment

where she sits  percent of the time

Maybe she doesn't have time to cook

so she chooses meals based off of convenience

which usually means what

Overly processed highsugar foods

Over time this poor diet mixed with stress from work

leads to a chronic disease

Let's call it diabetes

Medical care cost her and the company more money

which means more stress

Now she's worried about her health and making ends meet

so she's probably distracted and less productive

But she can't be remember

She's a single mother

Now she's thinking

What if something happens to me

Who is going to take care of my child

Who is going to take care of my baby

More stress

Now take that scenario tweak it whichever way you'd like

and lay it over the nation

and you might start to see

how we run up against that multitrillion dollar cost

This all hits very close to home for me

My father's one of the hardestworking and most intelligent people that I know

Don't get me wrong mom worked and provided too

but he definitely embraced the role of being the primary breadwinner

And I'm sure most of us can understand the stress and pressure

that comes with taking care of our families

But when you combine that with workplace stress

do you know what could happen

Developing irreversible high blood pressure

eventually losing function of your kidneys

and spending a decade on dialysis  his fate

Now I'm happy to report that he did get a kidney transplant

just last year

However 

Applause and cheers

However for nearly a decade

neither the economy nor my family got the benefit from his work ethic

or his intelligence

and as he would say

that's just really sad commentary

All I'm saying is

I think stress impacts the economy by reducing productivity

and increasing health care costs

Makes sense

Right

But here's what doesn't

Current research from the World Health Organization

puts global spending on health at  trillion dollars

Research from the Global Wellness Institute

suggests that the trilliondollar global wellness industry

grew from  to  trillion between  and 

and sees that growth into 

So what why do you care

Because that growth is nearly twice as fast as the global economy

averaging about  percent in the same period

So what does all that mean

Every year we're spending more per year on health

and the industries all about developing overall wellbeing

and living a healthier lifestyle

are growing almost twice as fast as the global economy

and yet we're losing trillions of dollars per year in output

So what's up

Laughter

Well stress levels are up

and I believe that needs to change

I also believe the way we think about stress needs to change

So let's try by reframing how we view it

See we tend to think about stress as a consequence

but I see it as a culture

Where do most of us spend our time

At work right

Where we face that scale of finding that worklife balance

So the bonds between work stress health and wellness

have never been closer

And yet there's a massive disconnect

in how we approach stress and wellbeing in the workplace

And we could blame many things right

New tech

laser focus on shareholder returns

or my favorite keeping up with the Joneses

and taking pictures while we try

But at the end of the day

I'm afraid that we've created a culture

where personal care and overall wellbeing are given the back seat

So how do we move forward

I believe the answer lies in three fundamental pillars

And if you find yourselves thinking

Rob I've heard this before tell me something I don't know

ask yourself

if we already know what to do

then what have we been doing

First corporations

Specifically how a corporation's culture and communication style

play a pivotal role in the stress and wellbeing of a workplace

The DNA of a company is its culture right

It sets the tone

even goes as far as defining the company

But I think companies should invest

in the overall mental physical and emotional wellbeing

of their employees

the way they invest in innovation R and D right

And do I think that this would increase productivity and reduce stress

I really do

But for it to really stick

a company has to figure out a way

to measure the overall wellbeing of its employees

with the same accuracy and precision that they project growth and earnings

And if this sounds like a tall order ask yourself

what really is a company's most competitive advantage

Its people

We know this

And just like anything in a company it has to start at the top

So if you're a leader

openly showing how you care for your mental health

and overall wellbeing

is a huge catalyst

It's no secret I'm a soccer fan

so growing up I had a couple of coaches

And I always had one who would lead the heavy cardio workouts

He would not stand on the side and spectate

He would participate

And that did three things

It made it difficult for me to complain

Laughter

I always made sure to keep up

and I always felt more dialed in to the exercise

It's the same idea

And finally communication

In order for me to really help my clients achieve their financial goals

requires that I actively listen and then respond

Let your employees tell you what stresses them out

Let them tell you what wellness benefits they need

And then act

And acting on what they tell you

will show how serious you take that feedback

and I can't help but feel the company will win in the long run

Why

Because properly equipped employees will be more productive and less stressed

Next I'd like to ask help from everyone's favorite uncle

That's right the government has to play a role in this

The World Economic Forum and the Harvard School of Public Health

estimate that from  to 

major chronic diseases and mental illnesses

will cost the global economy  trillion dollars

And it's 

Now I'm not saying stress causes all major chronic diseases

or all mental illnesses

but even if a portion of it is

imagine how much lower that number could be

if the government did what it does best 

serve as the enforcer

But in this case for higher workplace standards

I don't know maybe even corporate taxincentive programs

to help raise those standards

but the best wellness corporate policies and initiatives

backed by a forwardthinking government

won't matter much without help from the most crucial pillar

You

That's right stress and managing it is so dynamic

you have to play your part

And it's going to benefit you and the economy

Look folks I'm not a psychologist OK

But I have taken steps to develop my own mental health

and overall wellbeing

so here's my last two cents

I think a crucial first step is for everyone

is to be honest with themselves

About what

About putting your mental physical and emotional wellbeing

in the rear view

and the damage it has caused

Honest about placing public opinion above selfpreservation

Think social media

Honest about how we define ourselves and what actually does

Sure your career contributes to a portion of who you are

But are we allowing it to define us just a little too much

And ask

Is this bringing me the value I saw with what it costs me

And I don't just mean the dollars

For me being honest meant to get a good hard look at my relationship

with my thoughts courage and failure

Started years ago in this tournament championship game

coach comes to me and says Rob Cooke

you step up we can't lose today

So I stepped up

Failed

We lost

Laughter

Thanks for laughing

Laughter

Feels good

No but 
 
You know after that it stayed with me for a while

to the point where any opportunity to step up

grow develop

I'd quietly bow my head

step back

And then I discovered mindfulness

And I continued to develop it in my daily life to this day

To live in the present the now

Now I get it mindfulness may not be for everyone

but when I think of some of the most successful and impactful people

I see a common trend

Mastery of their mental game

Which includes stress management

It's all about developing awareness

acknowledgment and acceptance

of your current thoughts emotions environment and physical state

Right

Now I didn't say never facing stress

But the management of that stress 

that's the benefit again for you and the economy

I'll leave you with this thought

We all know that retirement is all about saving more now

for later

What if we treated our mental health and overall wellbeing

in the same capacity

Develop and save more of you now

for later in life

Doing nothing means more cost

and worse less time

And of the two

which can't you get back

So let's start moving this culture of stress forward

and start living happier healthier

and hopefully more productive lives

Thank you

Applause

Chris Anderson So our first speaker gave a TED Talk at TEDGlobal
Chris AndersonTEDGlobalTED
I think seven years ago

His name is Professor Uri Alon

at the Weizmann Institute of Science

Now he and his colleagues there have come up with a powerful idea

that addresses this key question

How on earth do we get back to work

without creating a second surge of the infection

Uri Alon welcome to TED
Uri AlonTED
Uri Alon Thank you Nice to be here again

CA It's great to see you again
CA
So I guess the key to your idea

is this obsession with the reproduction number R Rnaught
R
If that number is less than one

then fewer than one person is infected by a typical person

and eventually the epidemic fades away

People are worried that as we come back to work

R will shoot up above one again
R
You have a suggestion for how we might avoid that

What is that suggestion

UA Exactly
UA
So we are suggesting a strategy

that's based on a weak spot based on the biology of the virus

which is a cycle of work and lockdown

It exploits the vulnerability of the virus in that when a person gets infected

they're not infectious for about three days

So you don't infect others for the first three days

and after another two days on average you get symptoms

So we're proposing a strategy which is four days of work

and then  days of lockdown

and the next two weeks again four days of work  days of lockdown

And that way if a person gets infected at work

they reach their peak infectiousness during lockdown and that way

they avoid infecting many others

This restricts the viral transmission

Also just working four days out of two weeks

restricts the amount of time the virus gets to see many other people

and that's a very powerful effect

So everybody works on the same four days

kids go to school on the same four days

with all the measures of social distancing and masks etc

and then there's a lockdown period

CA So if you take the worstcase scenario
CA
where you come to work on a Monday morning at the start of your four days

and you're infected on the subway say on the way to work

the theory here is that even by the end of that four days

you're not really starting to infect your coworkers

UA That's correct
UA
So you're infected on the subway

and so for the first three days or so you're in your latent period

you don't infect your coworkers

you reach your peak infectiousness at home

there will be secondary infections at home

and people with symptoms can selfquarantine

and over the long run you have a reproduction number less than one

so the epidemic if you continue these cycles

will go away

CA I mean is it frustrating
CA
at the thought that people are going to say

Wait  I don't want to infect people at home

I'd rather infect people at work than at home

What's the response to that

UA Yes absolutely
UA
So we have to consider the alternatives

If you open up the economy and there's a second wave

you'll get all those infections anyway during the lockdown that happens

along with the devastating effects on the economy etc

And so in the long run

if you do a cyclic strategy like this

but with a reproduction number that's less than one

you avoid at least with these mathematical models and considerations

the much larger number of infections you'd get if there's a second wave

CA Right You're serving the needs of your family by  sorry go on
CA
UA Even people who are infected don't infect everyone at home
UA
The attack rates are  to  percent according to several studies

CA Right
CA
But the hope is that you're serving the needs of your family

by engaging in a strategy where very few of your fellow workers

are going to be infectious anyway

so that's the plan but um 

UA That's right
UA
CA Tell me this though  because four days out of 
CA
someone's going to say Well great idea

but that implies like a  percent loss of productivity

in the economy

so that can't possibly work

I think you think that the productivity loss

need not be anything like that much

UA That's right
UA
and of course most people don't work weekends

so it's four days out of the  work days in the two weeks

and once you have a predictable schedule

of four days at work

you can work longer hours

you can design shifts and get higher productivity

by prioritizing in those four days

much more than  percent of the workdays

CA Yes so talk through how that could work
CA
I mean let's imagine first of all manufacturing

which is currently shut down

Is the implication here that a manufacturer could set up

two possibly even three shifts of four days

maybe  hours or something of work over those four days

and still get a lot of productivity

basically having the lines almost running continuously that way

UA Exactly
UA
So this is a staggered version of this idea

where you take the population divide it into two groups or three groups

Let's say one group works four days and then  days of lockdown

Then the other group kicks in

This idea was proposed by colleagues at BarIlan University
BarIlan
Then you get an added benefit that during workdays there's less density

If there's two groups

there's half the density and less transmission

And you can keep production lines working almost continuously like that

using this staggered idea

CA And applying it to thinking about offices coming back 
CA
I mean it seems to me that as we've already seen

there's a lot of productivity that can happen when you're at home

so you could picture on this idea of people doing one set of things

during the four days when they're say back at the office

doing the exposure to each other sparking off each other

the discussions the brainstorming all that good stuff

while at home they're then doing all the things

that we've been doing the last few weeks

kind of working solo

How much have you thought about how that

whether it's possible effectively to divide work into different types

and actually use a strategy like this

to maintain almost full or even better productivity

UA I agree  for many sectors people work at home very effectively
UA
and we've heard from several industries

that productivity actually went up during lockdown

and people working at home

So if you have a schedule a [cyclic exit strategy]
[]
you can restrict the amount

or you can plan the work where you need to be together

in a very effective way

with avoiding a lot of time lost

if the person's work can be more effective at home

and more effective at work and get high productivity

I should say that some sectors really need to adjust

like hotels tourism dining

In several industries this will require more thought and adjusting

But other industries are almost built for ideas like this

Maybe it's even something you can consider after the epidemic

because productivity can be at least as high

CA I mean I read this and I started thinking about our own organization TED
CATED
and how in many ways you could argue that could work really well

I mean for one thing

there's this question about extroverts and introverts

Some introverts if they were honest

might say that this pandemic has been manna from heaven for them

They've found work less stressful

They've been able to focus and so forth

With this sort of four days on four days off type strategy

perhaps you can imagine a work world

that's optimized for both introverts and extroverts

UA Absolutely
UA
I mean I feel it also

Me and my partner with different personalities

we both teach in universities

and teaching through this

has [helped me] become productive in certain ways
[]
So I agree completely

and I think harnessing the creativity of people at workplaces

we're only at the beginning of what these kinds of mixtures can offer

CA But for people who are on the front line
CA
again if you're delivering goods and so forth

and you can't do that virtually

is there any thought about

how a four days on and then isolation strategy

how that off time could be used

to nonetheless contribute to that person's work

through some form of training

Or is it more just that people would work very intensely during four days

and maybe people still aren't quite earning their full pay in this scenario

but it's better than complete lockdown

and it's better than going back to work and seeing another surge

UA That's right
UA
So on a society level

it's better than opening up and seeing another surge

which would require complete lockdown

For people like hospital shifts

some hospitals adopted this kind of program

so we can protect shifts and avoid mixing

It also creates a lot of simplicity and clarity

So you understand when you're working

and you have some confidence because this is based on scientific modeling

about the effectiveness of this plan

It's also equitable in the sense that everybody gets to go to work

not only certain sectors

it's transparent etc

[Cross talk]
[]
CA And this is something that is best implemented
CA
by individual companies

Or is it actually much better implemented a city at a time

or even a nation at a time

UA We think it can work [in levels]
UA
So at certain companies it's very natural to adopt

or at hospitals schools etc

It can also work at the level of a town or a region

and then we would advise trying it out for something like a month

seeing whether cases rise

In that case you can dial down the number of workdays

Or if cases are declining quickly you can add workdays

and therefore adapt to the climate and the location where a person is

So it's quite adaptable

CA But by aligning work schedules with schools for example
CA
that suddenly allows parents to go back to work

on the days that their kids are at school and you'd have to try 

UA Absolutely
UA
CA I mean is the best instantiation of this
CA
that countries literally divide households

into different A and B categories or something like that
AB
so that that kind of alignment could happen

UA Exactly
UA
So you can align different households Group A and Group B
AB
and then the children go to school the parents go to work

in a synchronized way

and the other group let's say the alternating weeks

A certain amount of people need to work all the time

Maybe teachers are like essential workers and need to work throughout

Just like during lockdown situations

a certain fraction of the population still works throughout

But a region that does this should be protected in a sense

because it has a replication number of less than one

so imported infections also can't spread very much

CA And here is the aforementioned David Biello David
CADavid Biello
David Biello Yes Hello everybody
David Biello
Uri as you can imagine there are lot of questions
Uri
from the audience

and we have a first one

kind of about those workers who have been marked as essential

Can you comment on how this would impact the health care professionals and others

who may not have time or the flexibility to quarantine

in the way you suggest

UA That's great
UA
I want to say that there's essential workers

there's people with low income that just can't adhere to lockdown

because they have to make a living

And studies show that mobility [among] people in the lowincome sectors

is larger during lockdown

And also in developing countries people just have to go out of the house

You can't enforce lockdown

So this four kind of strategy can actually make lockdown easier to bear

for people who can still make a living during those days

or at least make their own choices

about what fraction to work and what fraction to stay in lockdown

Some countries can't get R less than one even with lockdown
R
because of this adherence problem because of informal sectors etc

We believe that a four cycle might make it easier to do lockdown

and maybe get our infection level less than one

That affects billions of people in the world

I hope I answered your question

DB I think so
DB
and we have another question I believe

if that can be queued up

which is

Any chance you can do the math

and quantify the increased risk of this four cycle

UA So the increased risk we're saying in our scientific paper
UA
we did all the sensitivity analyses etc

and the question is it's comparing increased risk comparing to what

So to the economy 

It's possible there will be a second wave

I mean I hope there won't be but it certainly is possible

and in that case it's clear that a second wave and another lockdown

will have worse consequences on health

than a cycle of four

And so it's really a question of what you're comparing to

DB Sure
DB
Well thank you so much for sharing this idea Uri
Uri
CA Indeed
CA
David stay on

But just before you go

Have any governments expressed interest in exploring this

Do you see people considering actually implementing this

as national policy

UA Yes we're in touch with several European countries
UA
and countries in South America and Israel of course

Austria has adopted a similar program for their school system

which is five school days every two weeks

And several companies and hospitals etc

And so we're very interested to see how this will play out

CA Well I love the basic start point
CA
of starting by looking at the enemy's weakness

And you've got this fourday period

where it's not necessarily that dangerous after an infection

if you could figure out a way to work then

I assume that testing would actually enhance this idea as well a lot right

To test people before they come back 

UA It's not predicated on testing
UA
You don't have to have testing for this idea

so that can apply to regions without a lot of testing

If you do have testing it could help you use testing in a more effective way

by concentrating testing on people at the end of their  lockdown days

just as they're about to go to work

that could make each test more impactful

in terms of reducing their reproduction number

CA Indeed instead of having to test the whole population
CA
every three or four days

it's just once every two weeks

That's a much more imaginable goal

UA Sure
UA
CA Yeah
CA
Well Uri Alon thank you so much for spending this time
Uri Alon
For the last few years

I've been a writer in residence at the Stanford Medical School

I was hired by an incredible woman

she's a poet and an anesthesiologist

named Audrey Shafer
Audrey Shafer
and she started the Medicine and the Muse Program

to reintroduce humanities back into medical education and training

My job was to teach writing storytelling

and general communication skills

to physicians nurses medical students

and other health care workers

And I thought I'd get a ton of great student essays

about dissecting cadavers and poems about the spleen

And I did

But almost immediately

I started getting more essays that made me really anxious

and really worried

My students were writing about their crushing anxiety

the unbearable pressure on them to succeed

their mental health diagnoses

their suicide attempts

how alone and isolated they felt

and wondered if they'd gone into the right profession

and they weren't even doctors yet

This is my student Uriel Sanchez
Uriel Sanchez
Audio Uriel Sanchez The choice you are given through medicine
Uriel Sanchez
from a lot of your mentors even is like

you have to choose

like being a really good person or a really good doctor

Music

Laurel Braitman Physicians' own humanity and emotional wellbeing
Laurel Braitman
are almost never made a core part of their training

or even acknowledged

And real vulnerability

like sharing certain mental health diagnoses for example

can be absolutely careerending

But nearly  percent of American medical students are depressed

and one in  have thought about suicide

And it's actually even worse for practicing physicians

There's really widespread job dissatisfaction

high rates of depression

and doctors have one of the highest suicide rates

of any profession in the United Sates

This is scary

Not just for them but for us too

I really think doctors have the most important job

And if their lives are at stake

ours are too

Now I am absolutely not a mental health professional

I'm a writer

which most days is absolutely the complete and total opposite

But I can tell you that the more opportunities

that I give health care workers

to share their daily frustrations their fears their joys

what surprises them what they resent

the better they seem to feel

So at Medicine and the Muse we offer evening weekend
Medicine and the Muse
and daylong storytelling workshops

at farms and other places with really good food

I invite other journalists writers producers

podcasters and poets

and they teach writing

communication and storytelling skills to our participants

And those participants practice being vulnerable

by sharing their stories out loud with one another

And in doing so

they reconnect with what drew them to medicine in the first place

These are the skills they'll draw on

when they realize and are confronted with the stressful messy reality

of the work they've chosen

This is how they realize it's a calling

So I have a prescription here for you today

It's not from physicians it's for them

and I asked my students for help

And before I start let me just say I work with doctors

but I'm absolutely convinced

that this applies to almost any profession

especially those of us who are so committed to our work

and it can be so intense and overwhelming

that sometimes we forget why we chose to do it in the first place

To me sharing a true vulnerable story

is a lot like raising a flag up a flagpole

Other people see it

if they agree with it and it resonates with them

they come and stand under it with you

That's what my student Maite Van Hentenryck did
Maite Van Hentenryck
Audio Maite Van Hentenryck I mean it was super anxietyinducing
Maite Van Hentenryck
and I shared parts of myself

that I really have probably told five classmates

LB When Maite was a baby she had to have her leg amputated
LBMaite
When she got to medical school

she was taking just a standard class quiz

and she got asked the question

Please tell us about the first time

you encountered someone with a disability

She wondered if her supervisors had ever considered

that the person with the disability was her the doctor

So she talked about it in front of about  of her friends peers

which is a big deal because you know she's really shy

And afterwards what happened

is a number of students with disabilities

that she didn't know

came up to her and asked her to colead a group on campus

that's now advocating for more visibility and inclusion in medical training

In English we tend to call people creatives

if they have a certain job

Like designer or architect or artist

I hate that term

I think it's offensive and exclusionary

Creativity doesn't belong to a certain group of people

A lot of my work with physicians and medical students

is just reminding them that no matter what profession we choose

we can make meaning

find beauty in the hard stuff and create

This is medical student Pablo Romano
Pablo Romano
Audio Pablo Romano My parents immigrated here from Mexico
Pablo Romano
many years ago

and when I was in college they passed away

I was  when my dad died and then  when my mom died

LB Not only has Pablo been talking publicly for the first time
LBPablo
about being an orphan

but together we started a live storytelling series we're calling Talk Rx
Talk Rx
and it's become a really popular place for his peers

to show their most vulnerable and powerful thoughts and feelings

Audio PR I go to a school
PR
that cares so much about data and research and numbers

At the end of the day what moves people is stories

LB Arifeen Rahman is a secondyear medical student
LBArifeen Rahman
And before she was born

her parents immigrated from Bangladesh to the United States

She grew up in a really beautiful home in Northern California

very safe and stable

her parents are still together

she never went hungry and she graduated from Harvard

Audio Arifeen Rahman I didn't feel like the stories I had
Arifeen Rahman
were worth telling or that they mattered

LB Arifeen did have stories though
LBArifeen
Recently she gave a talk about being maybe

the only Bangladeshi American girl

to win an essay contest

from the Daughters of the American Revolution 

Laughter

and then dress up for Halloween as the Declaration of Independence

And I love Arifeen's story so much

because to me it represents all that is good and bad

and hard and exhausting

about representing the new American dream

Audio AR The hardest thing was coming up against that voice
AR
that was telling me no one wants to hear my stories

like why invest the time in this thing

that doesn't really mean anything in the grand scale of life

Maybe the biggest thing is like maybe it does

LB Life is so short
LB
For me the only thing really that matters with my time here

is feeling like I can connect with other people

and maybe make them feel slightly less alone

And in my experience

that's what stories do absolutely the best

So my student and a collaborator in a lot of these endeavors

is Candice Kim
Candice Kim
She's an MDPhD student in medical education

She's written about MeToo in medicine
MeToo
navigating her queer identity in a conservative field

and her mom's metastatic cancer diagnosis

And recently she started also doing some really interesting research

about our work

Audio Candace Kim We've seen that students

who participate in our storytelling opportunity

show between a  and  percent decrease in distress

LB If this was a mental health drug
LB
it would be an absolute blockbuster

Results seem to last up to a month

It might be longer

a month is just when Candice stopped measuring
Candice
So we don't even know

Not only that but  percent of our participants

recommend these opportunities to a friend

For me though the most important thing that our work has done

is create a culture of vulnerability

in a place [where] there was absolutely none before

I think what this does

is that it allows doctors and other folks

an opportunity to envision a different kind of future for themselves

and their patients

This is Maite again

Audio MVH I want to be the doctor that remembers when your birthday is
MVH
without having to look at the chart

And I want to be the doctor who knows

what my patient's favorite color is

and what TV shows they like to watch

I want to be the doctor that's remembered for listening to people

and making sure I take care of all of them

and not just treating their disease

LB Being human is a terminal condition
LB
We all have it and we are all going to die

Helping health care professionals communicate more meaningfully

with each other

with their patients and with themselves

is certainly not going to magically change

everything that is wrong with the contemporary health care system

and it's not going to live to the immense burdens we place on our physicians

but it is absolutely key

in making sure that our healers are healthy enough

to heal the rest of us

Communicating with each other with vulnerability

listening with compassion

is I believe the absolute best medicine that we have

Thank you

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
Slam Ow
As anyone whos stubbed a toe in the dark
or spent an hour searching for their keys knows
we're often limited by what we can or cannot see
In fact even our own bodies can be black boxes
Today I want to take you through a vision of health care
that scientists and engineers myself included are building
We are creating a diagnostic lab inside your body
that can provide a continuous analysis of your health
so that we can better see what's happening in patients
Currently if someone is sick
we may diagnose them by using a biopsy
to bring disease tissue outside the body where we can see it
We do this if we suspect for instance that a growth might be cancerous
Unfortunately this approach can't work all the time
because of two major problems
First some tissues like brains or spinal cords
can't be routinely biopsied
And second doctors often don't know which tissue is causing the problem
so they don't know what to biopsy
So far we've dealt with these issues using external medical tests
like MRIs or blood tests
These provide a broad overview of the health of a patient
but they can't see the molecular and cellular changes
that occur within tissues
and they certainly can't provide enough information
to proactively treat patients before symptoms develop
This is unfortunate
because it's these invisible changes that ultimately cause disease
Our inability to measure these changes
results in a disparity between what we can see on a test
and what we know is happening in patients
Let's take multiple sclerosis as an example
In MS which is an autoimmune disease
the immune system attacks two specific tissues
the brain and the spinal cord
resulting in damage and in some cases paralysis
Now we obviously can't catch MS by routinely biopsying people's brains
where there would be abundant and active diseaseinducing cells
And we can't catch it using a blood test
because the MSinducing cells are so rare and inactive in the blood
that we simply can't see them
Even brain imaging technologies like MRI can't provide the information we need
to be proactive about MS
So we need to rethink how we see
My coworkers at the University of Michigan and I decided to do just that
Instead of taking an outsidein approach to diagnostics
we're taking an insideout approach
We are creating implantable sites
that have similarities to other sites in the body
and will improve our vision by giving us realtime access
to molecular and cellular information about diseased tissues
These insights will enable us to predict the onset of disease
and even identify therapies likely to work in an individual patient
So what does this insideout approach look like
Step one is to engineer new tissues just under the skin
These tissues have similarities to other inaccessible sites in the body
like the brain or the lungs
By implanting a porous plastic disk made of FDAapproved biomaterials
I can harness the body's natural responses to allow cells to migrate into the disk
survive at the site and form a tissue
Eventually we're left with an engineered tissue
with integrated immune cells
just the cells we need for diagnosis
Although these tissues are complex and chronically inflamed
they're also innocuous
and after a few weeks nearly imperceptible
Our engineered tissues contain information not present in the blood
and they can help bridge the gap
between what we can see on a traditional test
and cellular changes we know occur in disease
Step two is to read this signal
Currently I could take a biopsy of my engineered site and analyze it
because I made them accessible just under the skin
But it would certainly be better
if we could incorporate and read a sensor noninvasively
Within the next decade
rapidly converging technologies could enable diagnosis at such an implant
by harnessing simple detectors
like a blood pressure cuff or smartwatch does now
The mechanisms for diagnosing and monitoring disease
could be as simple as opening an app like Candy Crush on your phone
Step three is to harness the huge array of knowledge
in fields like engineering and material science
to improve these implants and our ability to read their data
Eventually tens if not hundreds of individual engineered tissues
with integrated sensors
may be implantable with a single application
Now this approach to diagnosis is unconventional to be sure
but it is robust
So far my colleagues and I have used it
to diagnose models of metastatic cancer
type  diabetes multiple sclerosis and organ transplant rejection
But this is just the beginning of what we can see
With continuous improvements
we will be able to truly create
a diagnostic lab inside your body
that provides a continuous analysis of your health
By changing how we see what's going wrong in patients
we will be able to diagnose and treat diseases better
and faster than ever before
If you're willing to rethink how you see
you may be surprised what comes into view
Thank you

You might have heard that if you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water
it will jump out right away
but if you put it in lukewarm water and then slowly heat it up
the frog won't survive
The frog's big problem is that it lacks the ability to rethink the situation
It doesnt realize that the warm bath is becoming a death trap 
until its too late
Humans might be smarter than frogs
but our world is full of slowboiling pots
Think about how slow people were to react to warnings about a pandemic
climate change or a democracy in peril
We fail to recognize the danger
because we're reluctant to rethink the situation
We struggle with rethinking in all kinds of situations
We expect our squeaky brakes to keep working
until they finally fail on the freeway
We believe the stock market will keep going up
even after we hear about a realestate bubble
And we keep watching Game of Thrones even after the show jumps the shark
Rethinking isn't a hurdle in every part of our lives
We're happy to refresh our wardrobes and renovate our kitchens
But when it comes to our goals identities and habits
we tend to stick to our guns
And in a rapidly changing world that's a huge problem
I'm an organizational psychologist
It's my job to rethink how we work lead and live
But that hasn't stopped me from getting stuck in slowboiling pots
so I started studying why
I learned that intelligence doesn't help us escape
sometimes it traps us longer
Being good at thinking can make you worse at rethinking
There's evidence that the smarter you are
the more likely you are to fall victim to the I'm not biased bias
You can always find reasons
to convince yourself you're on the right path
which is exactly what my friends and I did on a trip to Panama
I worked my way through college
and by my junior year I'd finally saved enough money to travel
It was my first time leaving North America
I was excited for my first time climbing a mountain
actually an active volcano literally a slowboiling pot
I set a goal to reach the summit and look into the crater
So we're in Panama
we get off to a late start
but it's only supposed to take about two hours to get to the top
After four hours we still haven't reached the top
It's a little strange that it's taking so long
but we don't stop to rethink whether we should turn around
We've already come so far
We have to make it to the top
Do not stand between me and my goal
We don't realize we've read the wrong map
We're on Panama's highest mountain
it actually takes six to eight hours to hike to the top
By the time we finally reach the summit
the sun is setting
We're stranded with no food no water no cell phones
and no energy for the hike down
There's a name for this kind of mistake
it's called escalation of commitment to a losing course of action
It happens when you make an initial investment of time or money
and then you find out it might have been a bad choice
but instead of rethinking it you double down and invest more
You want to prove to yourself and everyone else
that you made a good decision
Escalation of commitment
explains so many familiar examples of businesses plummeting
Blockbuster BlackBerry Kodak
Leaders just kept simmering in their slowboiling pots
failing to rethink their strategies
Escalation of commitment
explains why you might have stuck around too long in a miserable job
why you've probably waited for a table way too long at a restaurant
and why you might have hung on to a bad relationship
long after your friends encouraged you to leave
It's hard to admit that we were wrong
and that we might have even wasted years of our lives
So we tell ourselves
If I just try harder I can turn this around
We live in a culture that worships at the altar of hustle
and prays to the high priest of grit
But sometimes that leads us to keep going
when we should stop to think again
Experiments show that gritty people
are more likely to overplay their hands in casino games
and more likely to keep trying to solve impossible puzzles
My colleagues and I have found
that NBA basketball coaches
who are determined to develop the potential in rookies
keep them around much longer than their performance justifies
And researchers have even suggested
that the most tenacious mountaineers are more likely to die on expeditions
because they're determined to do whatever it takes to reach the summit
In Panama my friends and I got lucky
About an hour into our descent
a lone pickup truck came down the volcano
and rescued us from our slowboiling pot
There's a fine line between heroic persistence and stubborn stupidity
Sometimes the best kind of grit
is gritting your teeth and packing your bags
Never give up doesn't mean keep doing the thing that's failing
It means don't get locked into one narrow path
and stay open to broadening your goals
The ultimate goal is to make it down the mountain
not just to reach the top
Your goals can give you tunnel vision blinding you to rethinking the situation
And it's not just goals that can cause this kind of shortsightedness
it's your identity too
As a kid my identity was wrapped up in sports
I spent countless hours shooting hoops on my driveway
and then I got cut from the middle school basketball team all three years
I spent a decade playing soccer but I didn't make the high school team
At that point I shifted my focus to a new sport diving
I was bad
I walked like Frankenstein I couldn't jump
I could hardly touch my toes without bending my knees
and I was afraid of heights
But I was determined
I stayed at the pool until it was dark
and my coach kicked me out of practice Laughs
I knew that the seeds of greatness are planted in the daily grind
and eventually my hard work paid off
By my senior year I made the AllAmerican list
and I qualified for the Junior Olympic Nationals
I was obsessed with diving
It was more than something I did it became who I was
I had a diving sticker on my car
and my email address was diverag at aolcom
Diving gave me a way to fit in and to stand out
I had a team where I belonged and a rare skill to share
I had people rooting for me and control over my own progress
But when I got to college
the sport that I loved became something I started to dread
At that level
I could not beat more talented divers by outworking them
I was supposed to be doing higher dives
but I was still afraid of heights
and am practice was brutal
My mind was awake but my muscles were still asleep
I did back smacks and belly flops
and my slowboiling pot this time was a freezing pool
There was one question though that stopped me from rethinking
If I'm not a diver who am I
In psychology there's a term for this kind of failure to rethink 
it's called identity foreclosure
It's when you settle prematurely on a sense of who you are
and close your mind to alternative selves
You've probably experienced identity foreclosure
Maybe you were too attached
to an early idea of what school you'd go to
what kind of person you'd marry
or what career you'd choose
Foreclosing on one identity is like following a GPS
that gives you the right directions to the wrong destination
After my freshman year of college I rethought my identity
I realized that diving was a passion
not a purpose
My values were to grow and excel
and to contribute to helping my teammates grow and excel
Grow excel contribute
I didn't have to be a diver to grow excel and contribute
Research suggests that instead of foreclosing on one identity
we're better off trying on a range of possible selves
Retiring from diving
freed me up to spend the summer doing psychology research
and working as a diving coach
It also gave me time to concentrate on my dorkiest hobby
performing as a magician
I'm still working on my sleight of hand
Opening my mind to new identities opened new doors
Research showed me that I enjoyed creating knowledge
not just consuming it
Coaching and performing
helped me see myself as a teacher and an entertainer
If that hadn't happened
I might not have become a psychologist and a professor
and I probably wouldn't be giving this TED talk
See I'm an introvert
and when I first started teaching I was afraid of public speaking
I had a mentor Jane Dutton
who gave me some invaluable advice
She said You have to unleash your inner magician
So I turned my class into a live show
Before the first day I memorized my students' names and backgrounds
and then I mastered my routine
Those habits served me well
I started to relax more and I started to get good ratings
But just like with goals and identities
the routines that help us today
can become the ruts we get trapped in tomorrow
One day I taught a class on the importance of rethinking
and afterward a student came up and said
You know you're not following your own principles
They say feedback is a gift
but right then I wondered How do I return this
Takes a breath
I was teaching the same material the same way year after year
I didn't want to give up on a performance that was working
I had my act down
Even good habits can stand in the way of rethinking
There's a name for that too
It's called cognitive entrenchment
where you get stuck in the way you've always done things
Just thinking about rethinking made me defensive
And then I went through the stages of grief
I happened to be doing some research on emotion regulation at the time
and it came in handy
Although you don't always get to choose the emotions you feel
you do get to pick which ones you internalize
and which ones you express
I started to see emotions as works in progress
kind of like art
If you were a painter
you probably wouldn't frame your first sketch
Your initial feelings are just a rough draft
As you gain perspective you can rethink and revise what you feel
So that's what I did
Instead of defensiveness I tried curiosity
I wondered What would happen if I became the student
I threw out my plan for one day of class
and I invited the students to design their own session
The first year they wrote letters to their freshman selves
about what they wish theyd rethought or known sooner
The next year they gave passion talks
They each had one minute to share
something they loved or cared about deeply
And now all my students give passion talks
to introduce themselves to the class
I believe that good teachers introduce new thoughts
but great teachers introduce new ways of thinking
But it wasn't until I ceded control that I truly understood
how much my students had to teach one another
and me
Ever since then
I put an annual reminder in my calendar to rethink what and how I teach
It's a checkup
Just when you go to the doctor for an annual checkup
when nothing seems to be wrong
you can do the same thing in the important parts of your life
A career checkup to consider how your goals are shifting
A relationship checkup to reexamine your habits
An identity checkup to consider how your values are evolving
Rethinking does not have to change your mind 
it just means taking time to reflect
and staying open to reconsidering
A hallmark of wisdom
is knowing when to grit and when to quit
when to throw in the towel on an old identity
and dive into a new one
when to walk away from some old habits and start scaling a new mountain
Your past can weigh you down
and rethinking can liberate you
Rethinking is not just a skill to master personally
it's a value we need to embrace culturally
We live in a world that mistakes confidence for competence
that pressures us to favor the comfort of conviction
over the discomfort of doubt
that accuses people who change their minds of flipflopping
when in fact they might be learning
So let's talk about how to make rethinking the norm
We need to invite it and to model it
A few years ago
some of our students at Wharton challenged the faculty to do that
They asked us to record
our own version of Jimmy Kimmel's Mean Tweets
We took the worst feedback we'd ever received
on student course evaluations
and we read it out loud
Angela Duckworth It was easily one of  the worst three classes Ive ever taken
one of which the professor was let go after the semester
Mohamed ElErian The number of  stories you tell
give Aesops Fables a run for its money
Less can be more
Ouch
Adam Grant Youre so nervous
youre causing us to physically shake in our seats
Laughs
Mae McDonnell So great to finally have a professor from Australia
You started strong but then got softer
You need tenure so toughen up with these brats
I'm from Alabama
Michael Sinkinson Prof Sinkinson acts all down with pop culture
but secretly thinks Ariana Grande is a font in Microsoft Word
Laughs
AG After I show these clips in class
students give more thoughtful feedback
They rethink what's relevant
They also become more comfortable telling me what to think
because I'm not just claiming I'm receptive to criticism
I'm demonstrating that I can take it
We need that kind of openness in schools
in families in businesses in governments in nonprofits
A couple of years ago I was working on a project for the Gates Foundation
and I suggested that leaders could record their own version of Mean Tweets
Melinda Gates volunteered to go first
and one of the points of feedback that she read
said Melinda is like Mary effing Poppins
Practically perfect in every way
And then she started listing her imperfections
People at the Gates Foundation who saw that video
ended up becoming more willing
to recognize and overcome their own limitations
They were also more likely to speak up about problems and solutions
What Melinda was modeling was confident humility
Confident humility is being secure enough in your strengths
to acknowledge your weaknesses
Believing that the best way to prove yourself is to improve yourself
knowing that weak leaders silence their critics
and make themselves weaker
while strong leaders engage their critics and make themselves stronger
Confident humility gives you the courage to say I don't know
instead of pretending to have all the answers
To say I was wrong instead of insisting you were right
It encourages you to listen to ideas
that make you think hard
not just the ones that make you feel good
and to surround yourself with people who challenge your thought process
not just the ones who agree with your conclusions
And sometimes it even leads you to challenge your own conclusions
like with the story about the frog that can't survive the slowboiling pot
I found out recently that's a myth
If you heat up the water
the frog will jump out as soon as it gets uncomfortably warm
Of course it jumps out it's not an idiot
The problem is not the frog it's us
Once we accept the story as true we don't bother to think again
What if we were more like the frog
ready to jump out if the water gets too warm
We need to be quick to rethink
Thank you

In the middle of the th century
the California gold rush brought thousands of settlers to Americas west coast
But finding gold may have been easier  than transporting it back east
The only hope for avoiding  a grueling six month wagon journey
was to travel the narrowest portion  of the continent
the kilometer Isthmus of Panama
By  a railroad spanning the region significantly shortened to the trip
but unloading and reloading ships at each port cost time and money
To truly connect these two bodies of water shipping interests needed a canal
a continuous maritime passage through the isthmus
The first attempt at this colossal construction project was taken up in 
by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps
De Lesseps had supervised construction of Egypt's Suez Canal
but his success made him overconfident
He insisted on digging the canal  at sea level
even though it required boring  directly through
the Continental Divide mountain range
Futile excavation efforts were buried under constant landslides
And since the diplomat had only  visited the site briefly
during Panamas dry season
his workers were unprepared for  torrential storms venomous jungle fauna
and tropical diseases
After spending  million  and losing a staggering  lives
the French abandoned the project
The United States had been considering building a canal through Nicaragua
but at this point the chance to succeed where France failed was tempting
Panamanian leaders were also eager  to complete a canal
which would bring their country business and prestige
However Panama was still a part of Colombia at the time
and the country was stalling negotiations with the US
Sensing an opportunity
President Teddy Roosevelt  went straight to the Panamanians
With encouragement and military support  from the US
Panama launched a coup in 
Within days they became  an independent nation
and signed a treaty to begin  construction of the canal
Just over a decade after the French left the Americans were ready to dig in
and they were determined to avoid their predecessors mistakes
Instead of cutting the mountain down to sea level
they would raise the sea up the mountain
The plan was to build massive steel gates
separating the canal into multiple chambers with different water levels
As a ship passed through each  successive gate would open
lowering the water level  in the next chamber
while raising the ship  and allowing it to move on
The design called for five  of these socalled canal locks
three on the Atlantic side and two on the Pacific
raising traversing ships  meters  above sea level
Operating this lock system would require a massive reservoir of water
And fortunately the lowlying Chagres  river valley provided a natural solution
By building a dam across the gap  where the river flowed out to sea
the entire valley could be flooded
At  meters high  and over  meters wide
the Gatun Dam would be larger  than any built before
With this innovative plan
the Americans didnt need to excavate the entire mountain
but rather just the pathway for the canal itself
Still the work was staggering
Even after progress made by the French it took over nine years for  workers
to blow up shovel  and drill out the Culebra Cut
a roughly  kilometer passageway  through the Continental Divide
The railway now upgraded and rerouted to follow the canal
carted away over  million cubic meters of excavated rock
to be used at the Gatun Dam site
Construction was only half the battle
Leading army officials struggled  to maintain infrastructure and sanitation
but accidents and diseases took the lives of  workers
mostly Black Caribbean migrants
Then in the fall of  the moment finally came
A telegraph signal from President Woodrow Wilson triggered a dike explosion
flooding the Culebra Cut and joining  the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
Today nearly  vessels travel through the isthmus annually
each in under  hours
The canal remains Panamas  chief source of revenue
and since the country gained ownership of the passage in 
it has also become a source of national pride

In  Diane Hartley was writing  her undergraduate architecture thesis
when she made a shocking discovery
Her paper focused on the Citicorp Center  a skyscraper in midtown Manhattan
And after weeks poring over the buildings plans
shed stumbled on a potentially deadly mistake
An oversight that threatened to topple  the story tower
into one of New York Citys  most densely populated districts
When it was built two years earlier
Citicorp Center was one of the world's tallest buildings
Its sloped roof was unique in the city skyline
but its more distinctive feature lay at the base
Since the construction site was already occupied by St Peter's Lutheran Church
the new skyscraper had to be built  on columns supporting it like stilts
Using stilts on a buildings corners  wasnt unheard of
but because the church stood at the corner of the block
these stilts had to be placed at the center of each side
While this novel design worried some of the building's backers
chief structural engineer  William LeMessurier
took numerous precautions to ensure  the buildings stability
The outside would consist  of vshaped chevrons
forming a strong exoskeleton  to support the skyscraper
This external structure also made the building much lighter
meaning thered be less weight  to support overall
This design did leave the building  vulnerable to strong winds
But LeMessurier had another  stateoftheart solution
a tuned mass damper
This ton counterweight was controlled by computerized sensors
designed to counteract any swaying
With these structures in place
calculations showed that each side of the  building could withstand powerful winds
And with all safety issues resolved  the building opened for business in 
But when Hartley was studying the tower  a year later she noticed something odd
It was true that each face of the building could endure powerful winds
And since a buildings broad sides catch the most wind
these would typically be the strongest winds a building encounters
However the towers unique base meant that winds
blowing on the buildings corners  were actually the bigger threat
And since traditional designs didn't warrant safety calculations
for corner winds
it seemed to Hartley that the threat  had gone unaccounted for
When Hartley contacted LeMessuriers firm about the issue
they assured her the building was strong enough to handle these winds
But checking the plans again LeMessurier noticed an alarming detail
A change approved without his knowledge
had replaced the exoskeletons  welded joints
with cheaper and weaker bolted joints
This alone wasnt enough to topple  the tower thanks to the mass damper
But if a storm knocked out the building's power
it would deactivate  the counterweights sensors
leaving the building vulnerable to winds  of just  kilometers per hour
Given available weather data
a storm this strong had  a oneinsixteen chance
of hitting New York City  every single year
LeMessurier never told Hartley  what shed uncovered
In fact everything he did next  was top secret
After filling in the architects  and executives at Citicorp
LeMessuriers team worked with city  officials to craft a confidential plan
Without warning the residents
construction crews began  a string of nighttime shifts
to reinforce the bolted joints
This delicate work began  in midAugust 
and was only halfway complete when Hurricane Ella
approached the city in September
City officials and Citicorp executives  planned an emergency evacuation
for a block radius
but at the last minute  the hurricane veered out to sea
These secret evacuation plans  were never used
and the reinforcements were completed  just a month later
Typically it wouldve been impossible for this covert construction to go unnoticed
But the press was occupied  with a newspaper strike
spanning the length  of the reinforcement project
In fact the public didn't learn how close they'd come to disaster until 
when a New Yorker article revealed the story to the city and to Diane Hartley
Like LeMessurier the article failed  to give credit where it was due
but at least Hartley knew  that her homework had saved lives

By the end of the th century
the race to build the world's tallest skyscraper grinded to a halt
Each new contender was only slightly taller than the one before
and architects were running out of ways to top their previous efforts
But in  construction began on a new building in Dubai
promising a revolutionary design  that would dwarf the competition
In  the meter Burj Khalifa  was complete
surpassing the previous  recordholder by over 
So what innovations allowed  for such a huge leap in height
For most of architectural history heavy building materials
made it difficult for tall buildings  to support their own weight
To compensate taller structures had  wider thicker masonry at the base
making them substantially more expensive
The arrival of industrial steel  in the early th century
helped buildings shed weight  and stretch to new heights
But steel frames required intensive labor to produce
often under poor working conditions
And when they were finished
these three dimensional grids took up huge amounts of space inside buildings
Tall steel skyscrapers also had  larger less dense surfaces
making them vulnerable to strong winds
Architects designed various  countermeasures
to prevent swaying and structural damage
but to increase height further
engineers would have to completely rethink how tall buildings were designed
Enter the father of modern skyscrapers Fazlur Rahman Khan
This BangladeshiAmerican engineer believed tall structures
should bear their weight where they were  widest and most stable on the outside
He proposed swapping an internal grid  of steel beams
for a steel and concrete exoskeleton
that would make buildings more resilient to wind
while using far less heavy materials
Khan developed this idea into what he called tubular designs
These buildings had exterior steel frames that were braced with concrete
and connected to horizontal floor beams
Tubular frames proved superior at absorbing and transferring
the force of wind to a building's foundation
And since the exterior walls could bear the bulk of the load
internal supporting columns could be removed to maximize space
Following the s tubular design became the industry standard
This new philosophy allowed  for the construction
of taller sturdier skyscrapers
including many of the record holders  for worlds tallest building
But planning the Burj Khalifa would take one more innovation
In  the late Fazlur Khans  longtime employers
Skidmore Owings amp Merrill completed  the Tower Palace III in South Korea
This building took Khan's exoskeleton design one step further
with a central column supported by three protruding wings
Each wings weight carries the other two
while the heavy concrete core acts  as a support beam
that also houses the buildings elevators  and mechanical infrastructure
This design called the buttressed core
allowed the entire structure to work  as a single loadbearing unit
supporting the buildings  stories
SOM was confident the buttressed core could support a much taller building
and they were determined to see how high they could go with their next project
As only the second building to use this design
the Burj Khalifa spans  an unprecedented  floors
To battle the monumental  vertical and lateral forces
the design strategically places  the strongest loadbearing areas
where the wind is also most powerful
Additionally the Yshaped layout  was specifically calibrated
to minimize local wind forces
Every several floors  one of the wings recedes slightly
forming a series of setbacks in a clockwise pattern
This spiral shape disperses air currents
transforming  kilometer per hour winds into harmless gusts
Considering its height and unique design
the Burj Khalifa was completed  in a staggeringly short five year period
However this pace came at a great human cost
The workforce consisted mostly  of South Asian migrants
who regularly endured shifts  over  hours long
for a daily wage of roughly 
Those who tried to quit or return home  had their paychecks and passports withheld
by the projects construction company
These abusive conditions led to multiple protests
in addition to at least one suicide  and one fatal accident reported on site
In the years following  the towers completion
the United Arab Emirates fell under harsh scrutiny
for failing to enforce worker protection laws
Hopefully future projects will prioritize the individuals
behind these engineering marvels  over the buildings themselves

In the spring of  Tokyo residents experienced numerous aerial attacks
from Allied bombers
Air raid sirens warned citizens  to get indoors
and preceded strategic blackouts across the city
But year old Hisako Koyama  saw these blackouts as opportunities
Dragging a futon over her head  for protection
Koyama would gaze at the night sky
tracking all sorts  of astronomical phenomena
However her latest endeavor required  the light of day
By angling her telescope towards the sun
Koyama could project the star's light onto a sheet of paper
allowing her to sketch  the suns shifting surface
She spent weeks recreating this set up tracking every change she saw
But while Koyama didn't know it
these drawings were the start  of one of the most important records
of solar activity in human history
To understand exactly what Koyama saw on the suns surface
we first need to understand  whats happening inside the star
Every second  trillions of oxygen molecules
fuse into helium molecules in a process called nuclear fusion
This ongoing explosion maintains  the suns internal temperature
of roughly  million degrees Celsius
which is more than enough energy  to transform gas
into churning pools of plasma
Plasma consists of charged particles  that produce powerful magnetic fields
But unlike the stable charged particles  that maintain magnetic activity on Earth
this plasma is constantly in flux
alternately disrupting and amplifying the sun's magnetic field
This ongoing movement can produce
temporary concentrations  of magnetic activity
which inhibit the movement of molecules  and in turn reduce heat in that area
And since regions with less heat  generate less light
places with the strongest magnetic fields appear as dark spots
scattered across the suns surface
These socalled sunspots  are always moving
both as a result of plasma  swirling within the sphere
and the suns rotation
And because theyre often  clustered together
accurately counting sunspots and tracking  their movement can be a challenge
depending greatly on the perception  and judgment of the viewer
This is precisely where Koyamas  contributions would be so valuable
Despite having no formal training in astronomy
her observations and sketches were remarkably accurate
After sending her work  to the Oriental Astronomical Association
she received a letter of commendation for her dedicated and detailed observations
With their support she began to visit  the Tokyo Museum of Science
where she could use a far superior telescope to continue her work
Koyama soon joined the museum's staff as a professional observer
and over the next  years  she worked on a daily basis
producing over  drawings of the suns surface
Researchers already knew magnetic currents in the sun followed an  year cycle
that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped  path over the stars surface
But using Koyamas record
they could precisely follow  specific sunspots and clusters
through that journey
This kind of detail offered a realtime indication of the suns magnetic activity
allowing scientists to track  all kinds of solar phenomena
including volatile solar flares
These flares typically emanate from the vicinity of sunspots
and can travel all the way  to Earths atmosphere
Here they can create geomagnetic storms
capable of disrupting long range  communication and causing blackouts
Solar flares also pose a major risk  to satellites and manned space stations
making them essential to predict  and plan for
During an interview in 
Koyama lamented that her  years  of observation had barely been enough
to produce a single butterfly record of the solar cycle
But by the end of her career  shed drawn three and a half cycles
one of the longest records ever made
Better still the quality of her drawings was so consistent
researchers used them as a baseline  to reconstruct the past  years
of sunspot activity from various historical sources
This project extends Koyamas legacy far beyond her own lifetime
and proves that science is not built solely on astounding discoveries
but also on careful observation of the world around us

In  a British Airways plane flew from New York to London
in a recordbreaking  two hours and  minutes
Today however passengers flying  the same route
can expect to spend no less than six hours in the air twice as long
So why in a world where everything  seems to be getting faster
have commercial flights lagged behind
The BritishandFrenchmade Concorde began shuttling passengers
across the sky in the s
Jetting between destinations like  New York Paris Bahrain and Singapore
it clocked in at over  kilometers  per hour
more than twice the speed of a normal airliner
However this was also about  kilometers per hour faster than the speed of sound
And that created a surprising problem  for people on the ground
When an object moves at supersonic speed
it generates a continuous moving shockwave known as a sonic boom
This produces a loud startling noise
as well as rattling windows and dislodging structural elements of buildings
Since a plane flying at an altitude  of  kilometers
can affect an area with an  kilometer diameter on the ground below
complaints and concerns from residents  in the Concordes flight path
restricted it to mostly ocean routes
Because of these restrictions and other fuel and engineering requirements
supersonic flights turned out  to be very expensive
for both airlines and passengers
A single transatlantic roundtrip could cost the equivalent
of more than  today
With additional strain  on the airline industry
due to decreased demand for flights after September th 
this became unsustainable  and the Concorde was retired in 
So even when superfast flights existed they weren't standard commercial flights
And while we might think that advances  in flight technology
would make fast flights less expensive  this hasnt necessarily been the case
One of the biggest concerns  is fuel economy
Over the decades jet engines have become a lot more efficient
taking in more air  and achieving more thrust
traveling further for every liter of fuel
But this efficiency is only achieved  at speeds
of up to around  kilometers per hour less than half the speed of the Concorde
Going any faster would increase air intake and burn more fuel per kilometer flown
A standard transatlantic flight still uses as much as  liters of fuel
amounting to over   of an airlines total expenses
So any reduction in fuel economy  and increase in speed
would significantly increase both  flight costs and environmental impact
What about ways to make a plane faster  without burning lots of fuel
Adjusting the wing sweep or the angle at which wings protrude from the fuselage
to bring the wings closer in can  make an aircraft faster
by reducing aerodynamic drag
But this means the wings must be longer to achieve the same wingspan
and that means more materials and more weight
which in turn means burning more fuel
So while airplanes could be designed to be more aerodynamic
this would make them more expensive
And generally airlines have found  that customer demand for faster flights
is not sufficient to cover these costs
So while military aircraft conduct  high speed flights
over water and at high altitudes
supersonic commercial flights seemed like a brief and failed experiment
But recent advances may make them feasible again
Research by NASA and DARPA has shown  that modifying an aircrafts shape
can reduce the impact  of its sonic boom by 
Extending the nose with a long spike can break the shockwave into smaller ones
while another proposed design features  two sets of wings
producing waves  that cancel each other out
And new technologies may solve  the energy efficiency problem
with alternative and synthetic fuels or even hybridelectric planes
It may yet turn out that the last  few decades of steady flying
were just a brief rest stop

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
Its a warm morning and Im surrounded by sixyearold children in a classroom
One by one they cheerfully hug one of their friends
who just came back home from a trip
They comment on her new dress and her new hairstyle
But the girl does nothing
She looks towards the distant horizon eyes fixed
The kids start wondering why she doesn't speak
The girl's name is Adayanci
and the trip she has just returned from is not a vacation
She left Guatemala with her dad in May  for the United States
Several months later she's back but she has gone silent
I'm filming this feeling overwhelmed
and finding it difficult to look through the viewfinder of my camera
Her posttraumatic stress disorder is so visible
I am in tears
I am a journalist who documents aftermaths for a living
The impact the invisible consequences
What happens when the media spotlight is gone
That's why I've spent hundreds of hours listening to and watching people
deeply affected by trauma
Survivors of trafficking child rape gang slavery forced labor
and immigration enforcement
Different from the job of psychiatrist and aid workers
I've dedicated my life to listening to them
to make their stories public
in first person in their own voice
Despite all of the limitations of words and photographs and films
I believe better stories about the effects of trauma
in people's lives are essential
They can show us the real consequences of seemingly abstract government policies
They can trigger understanding across political divides
and awaken our universal sense of empathy
Survivors like the now deceased Jennifer
taught me that brutal bondage does not happen far away
David taught me the horrors  refugees flee from
are scarier than any obstacle in the quest for safety
Adayanci brought home for me that governments of developed nations
also harm using trauma as a weapon
The word trauma comes from ancient Greek
It's the word for injury
It's the psychological wound that stays
after something really terrible has happened to us
It affects our body our mind
our memory and our sense of safety in the world
War violence kidnapping torture
they are all causes of trauma
But it does not only happen far away far from you
In the United States for example
several largescale community studies
have shown that exposure to violence and terror
like rape domestic abuse or trafficking
are common and damaging in times of peace
What I witnessed in that classroom in Guatemala
was the aftermath of the zerotolerance policy
It separated children from parents at the USMexico border
Adayanci was sent to a shelter and two foster families
while her dad was deported
In her despair she took a pair of scissors
and cut her own hair as a form of protest
A psychologist diagnosed her with acute stress
warning it would become posttraumatic stress disorder
the longer time passed
The damage of this type of separation
at an early age
just like other forms of abuse
can be permanent if the child doesn't receive help
In order to justify this kind of violence
there is a will to make certain people seem very different from us
Evil rapists animals criminals
Stripping off their humanity
is a deliberate technique used by governments
with plenty of examples in history books
In this case the socalled evil criminal and animal
was a shattered sixyearold girl
We published Adayanci's documentary
The story won a World Press Photo award
thanks to which Adayanci is receiving therapy in Guatemala
She's on her slow way back to recovery dancing and daydreaming
But most others have not gotten access to care
Hundreds haven't even been reunited with their families
The trauma these policies cost can have generational effects
Even in Adayanci's fortunate case
the family has no institutional support and is in deep debt
We humans heal from trauma through feeling safe
through storytelling
and through establishing connection with others in our communities
For this little girl reframing the story she will tell herself
it's part of her healing
For us as a society
reframing her story and pressuring our governments to do better
is part of reclaiming our dignity as equals
Thank you

Take a deep breath
In that single intake of air
your lungs swelled with roughly  sextillion molecules
ranging from compounds produced days ago
to those formed billions of years  in the past
In fact many of the molecules  youre breathing were likely
exhaled by members  of ancient civilizations
and innumerable humans since
But what exactly are we all breathing
Roughly  of Earths atmosphere is composed of nitrogen
generated by volcanic activity  deep beneath the planets crust
The next major ingredient is oxygen accounting for  of Earths air
While oxygen molecules have been around as long as Earths oceans
oxygen gas didnt appear until  ocean dwelling microorganisms
evolved to produce it
Finally  of our air is argon
a molecule formed from the radioactive decay of potassium
in Earths atmosphere crust and core
Together all these dry gases  make up  of each breath you take
Depending on when and where you are the air may also contain some water vapor
But even more variable  is that remaining 
which contains a world of possibilities
This small slice of air is composed of numerous small particles
including pollen fungal spores  and liquid droplets
alongside trace gases like methane and carbon dioxide
The specific cocktail of natural  and manmade compounds
changes dramatically from place to place
But no matter where you are
 of every breath you take  likely contains manmade pollutants
potentially including toxic compounds  that can cause lung disease cancer
and even DNA damage
Theres a wide variety of known pollutants but they all fall into two categories
The first are primary pollutants
These toxic compounds are directly emitted
from a manmade  or naturally occurring source
However they don't always come from the places you'd expect
Some large factories mostly generate  water vapor
with only small quantities of pollutants  mixed in
Conversely burning wood or dung can  create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
dangerous compounds that have been  linked to several types of cancer
as well as longterm DNA damage
In all cases pollutants interact with regional weather patterns and topography
which can keep compounds local  or spread them kilometers away
When these molecules travel  through the air a transformation occurs
Natural compounds called oxidants formed by oxygen and sunlight
break down the pollutants
Sometimes these reactions make pollutants more easily washed out by rain
But in other cases they result  in even more toxic secondary pollutants
For example when factories burn coal
they release high concentrations of sulfur oxides
These molecules oxidize to form sulfates
which condense with water vapor in the air to form a blanket of fine particles
that impair visibility  and cause severe lung damage
This socalled sulfurous smog was  wellknown in th century London
and continues to plague cities  like Beijing
Since the advent of cars
another secondary pollutant  has taken center stage
Exhaust from fossil fuelburning vehicles releases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons
which react to form ozone
And while some ozone  in the upper atmosphere
helps shield us from ultraviolet rays on the ground
this gas can form alongside secondary particles and create photochemical smog
This brown fog can be found covering densely packed cities
making seeing difficult  and breathing hazardous
It also contributes to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere
In recent decades industrial activity has contributed to a huge spike
in various trace gas emissions
fundamentally changing the air  we all breathe
Many places have already responded with countermeasures
Most cars produced since the s  are equipped with catalytic converters
that reduce the emission  of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides
And today places like Beijing are battling smog
by electrifying  their energy infrastructure
and limiting automobile emissions  altogether
But while moving away from fossil fuels  is essential
there's no universal remedy for air pollution
Different regions need to respond  with unique regulations
that account for their local pollutants
Because no matter where you live  we all share the same air

Voiceover Andrew Youn I have incredible belief
in the strength and power of African farmers
The farmers I get to serve are incredibly inspiring
hardworking and confident mostly women
that earn a better life for their families
They have an incredible amount of power
They're just not always equipped with the right tools
So my organization makes a few little tweaks
and enables farm families to succeed at a whole nother level
At One Acre Fund we like to say farmers stand at the center of the world
[Therese Niyonsaba Farmer]
Voiceover In Kinyarwanda My name is Therese Niyonsaba
I started working with TUBURA in 
[In Rwanda One Acre Fund operates under the name Tubura
which means to grow exponentially]
Voiceover TN I heard about TUBURA
when the field officer came to meet farmers who had joined before me
I had seen how they were farming and I asked them
Where do you get the fertilizer
to yield such a good harvest
They told me they get it from TUBURA
[Price Claudine Field Officer ONE ACRE FUND  TUBURA]
Voiceover In Kinyarwanda PC I first met Therese in 
She was eager to learn modern agricultural methods
Women speaking
TN My harvest was not enough to feed my family
I struggled to feed my children
I decided to expand my land
to increase my harvest
AY Most of the world's poor are farmers
and so when farmers become more productive
then they earn more income
and mass numbers of people move out of poverty
They produce more food for their communities and end hunger
From the farmer's perspective basically
One Acre Fund provides a small loan
that makes these simple farm inputs affordable
So this is for example professional seed
which is  percent natural locally produced
a tiny microdose of fertilizer
which is necessary for plant nutrients
and for example tree seedlings
Then we provide physical delivery of these farm inputs
and then training
Voiceover PC With TUBURA we improved planting techniques
The skills the farmers learned include fertilizer application
and using selected seed to yield a good harvest
We also learned to plant in a line
That helped us to get a better harvest
AY We are an agricultural organization
Therefore nearly all of our staff live in rural places near the farmers
And so it's just so obvious to me that to provide effective service
we need to be as close as possible
PC Before the inputs were close to the farmers
they had to travel long distances
and even pay for transport to pick them up
But today they immediately take their inputs home
Voiceover PC When farmers are harvesting
I visit them in their field
to check if the crops are ready to be harvested
I advise them to wait until the crops are ready
and are more useful to them
Voiceover TN After joining TUBURA my harvest remarkably increased
We can eat We are so happy
And we sell the surplus of our harvest
AY Today we serve about a million families
in our fullservice program
and a little more than a million families through our work with partners
Voiceover PC My relationship with Therese is good
Every time I visit her she is so happy
AY In a nutshell we have basically three goals with this Audacious proposal
One is to expand our direct fullservice program
to reach two and a half million families per year by 
which more than  million children are living in those families
We can also hope by 
to serve an additional  million families per year
together with these kind of operational partners
in the government and private sector
And then lastly we want to help shape
a more environmentally appropriate green revolution
There's an incredible opportunity for farmers to lead the way
to lead to a more sustainable society
both in how we shape food systems and having more diverse food systems
but also for example planting tons and tons of trees
We can now realistically kick off a campaign
to plant about a billion trees in the coming decade
Voiceover TN After working with TUBURA I was able to build my house
I was able to buy a solar light
I have light in my house
My children are eating No problem
I'm so happy
Working with TUBURA gave me value
TUBURA is at my heart
I am so happy with TUBURA
Music

I'm so happy and proud to be here
When I told my husband about this wonderful opportunity
he said TED Talk Wow I get to do that a lot around here
It's finally someone else's turn
So yes I happen to be married to a wonderful man named Ted
which is pretty rare in Finland where I'm from
It's not a typical Finnish name at all trust me
Myself I'm a business professor and I love teaching
But you know what
My students are fed up
they're really fed up with the way business is screwing up the environment
and making wealth inequality worse
and putting money and profits above all else
And what really makes them mad
is when I tell them about the cooperative movement
They're angry
because once they understand how cooperatives work
they feel like a secret solution has been kept hidden
Before I tell you more about why cooperatives are so great
I want to explain what they are
A cooperative is an organization that is owned by its members
who are also its customer and decision maker
And unlike most businesses
where certain owners can buy more power and influence
in a cooperative every member has one vote
which was a revolutionary idea back when the model was first introduced
A regular man not to mention a woman
with no significant means or a prestigious position in a society
as an owner an equal partner in business
Unheard of
Perhaps it's still a bit revolutionary
Cooperatives exist in a sweet spot
between the forprofit and nonprofit worlds
Their uniqueness is based on the idea of duality
They have two distinct but complementary roles
On one hand they act like any other business
and try to make money
But on the other hand cooperatives are and do so much more
They are peoplecentered enterprises run by and for their members
and they try to achieve economical but also social and cultural goals
to benefit those members who are just regular people
like you and me
And what has happened for almost  years
is that cooperatives have proven to make decisions
with a view across generations instead of quartertoquarter
to benefit more people
and to anchor wealth in communities
that might not otherwise attract investment
while still being competitive and innovative
Sounds pretty good right
I guess that's why at the end of a class the other day
a student all red and jazzed up basically shouted at me
I've always been a straight A student
done all the work read all the books
and now you're telling me that all my life
I've missed hearing about a movement with this magnitude
I get this a lot
The organized cooperative movement started in 
with the [Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society]
This was a group of weavers and artisans
who out of desperation opened a store together
to sell things that they could neither get nor afford alone
The cooperative movement spread from there
and became a global phenomenon
Many of the modernday credit unions and farm credit systems
you see in North America
are descendants of the famous cooperative Raiffeisen system in Germany
And here in Finland a man named Hannes Gebhard
is considered to be the father of the Finnish cooperative movement
In the th century he introduced cooperatives
to help people tackle debt poverty and unemployment
It turns out this is the foundation
of a country known for its democratic values
highquality education
and the happiness of its citizens
And this line of impact of the cooperative movement
can be found in other places in the world too
I'm proud to say that in relative terms
Finland is one of the most cooperative countries in the world
We have about  million people
who have over seven million memberships
in cooperatives that run everything from groceries to banks
Each time I shop at our grocery cooperative
when I fill in my gas tank
eat at our jointly owned restaurants stay at a hotel
or buy clothes or hardware stuff
I get bonuses that can be up to five percent
And when I pay with our cooperative's bank card
I get an additional half percent off
And I know that when the cooperative is doing well
it's not funding a single person's luxury vacation in the Bahamas
Every year a governance body comprised of elected representatives
decides how any operating surplus will be used
Some of the money will go back to the members
For example this year our consumer cooperative
PohjoisKarjalan Osuuskauppa
or PKO as we call it 
is part of the S Group
which is the biggest cooperative group in Finland 
they had a surplus of two percent on members' purchases
and  percent return on money invested
When you add up the savings and the return
my family received more than  euros back
which is more than we spend on groceries in one month
Not to mention that our groceries are about seven percent cheaper
than its main competitor
I'm a memberowner in three cooperatives
and my husband has four memberships
a consumer a bank an insurance and a water cooperative
We have two beautiful girls who are  and  years old
and they are also memberowners of the S Group
Their memberships cost us one hundred euros each
We want to pass on the legacy
and teach them about the benefits of cooperatives early on
And of course
they are very happy about the yearly interest
on cooperative capital
But it's not just about us getting money back
It's about the greater good for our community
I'm not only talking about taxes and employment
even though our consumer cooperative is the biggest employer in the area
I'm talking about support for young people sports arts
university and cultural events
For example
as a member of the board of PKO
a few years ago we agreed to build a sports hall for Lieksa
which is a nearby city here in the eastern part of Finland
belonging to our cooperative's operational area
After we built it
the city signed a very longterm rental agreement with us
so financially the investment made sense
And of course it was a major gesture to the local people
who now have proper facilities to do all kinds of sports
In another case
we ended up rejecting the investment proposal
regarding building a senior house downtown
The idea was a very good one but we declined
because it was a big housing complex
requiring a lot of capital with a low expected investment return
that would only serve a small part of the membership
less than one percent of our over  members
and therefore we decided against it
In a cooperative if we only emphasize profitability
the interests of the membership may quickly become secondary
On the other hand
a situation where too much consideration
is given to the members' differing and changing interests
may jeopardize business performance
So therefore finding a balance is important
One role should not have priority over the other
Metaphorically speaking
cooperatives by nature have been given two solid feet
and as you know it's much easier to stand on two feet than on one foot
Ensuring that is the board's most important task
It is a very cool system
That balance means that cooperatives can help us
meet ambitious environmental goals
In Finland for example
S Group aims at carbon negativity by the year 
REScoopeu a network of  energy cooperatives
with way over one million members
is promoting community energy
which is key to a decarbonized economy
and a crucial step in tackling climate change
This is about more than windmills and solar panels
Community energy can help overcome the urban and rural divide
and close the gap between north and south
between rich and poor
because it empowers local people
Community energy leads to energy democracy
holding the promise of an economy and a society
based on cooperation rather than competition
within the boundaries of planet Earth
What is so wonderful about the cooperative system worldwide
is that while cooperatives may sell different products or services
the goal is still the same for all of them
to create sustainable businesses that benefit the people
and the communities they serve lasting for generations
This is also a significant global phenomenon
an invisible giant of the economy
resonating so well with the values of regular people
a form of business that recognizes
that we people have other motivations and interests
than purely and only economical ones
Today there are more than three million cooperatives around the world
with over a billion members
employing  million people
which is  percent more than multinational companies
Cooperatives sell more than two trillion dollars' worth
of goods and services
That number is larger than the GDP of Canada
Doing good business and doing good at the same time
really makes an excellent match
and this really works because it's all about participation
And while having lots of people involved in any project
can often make things a little bit more complicated
we can also often get better and fairer outcomes
We can create better businesses if we truly include the people they serve
When we Finns travel abroad
we tend to brag about our sauna sisu fresh air
clean waters and endless forests
And of course that the real Santa Claus comes from Finland
But what we really should be bragging about is our cooperatives
Because unlike capitalism the cooperative movement is not broken
It just needs better marketing
Thank you

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
Anita died in my presence while giving birth to life
She bled to death and lost her child
The irony was that she had access to care
In the first trimester of pregnancy
she had visited the antenatal clinic of the hospital in Mumbai
where I was doing residency
But over four hours of waiting in the hot sweaty
dingy overcrowded clinic
just to get a minute with me
a harried overworked resident doctor
meant that she never came back
only to die in labor months later
I was wracked with guilt
If only I had counseled her about the danger signs
why she needed to access regular care
Would she and her child have survived
She did not die due to a terminal condition
She died because of underlying anemia
an easily treatable preventable condition
I saw these stories daily
Systemic preventable problems resulting in mothers and children dying
in the most unjust of circumstances
In the next one hour
three women will die while giving birth somewhere in India
Two children under age five die every minute in India
I am a practicing urogynecologist
but very early in my medical training
I realized that hospitalbased solutions were not enough
And given the sheer scale of India's problems
any solution that made a difference had to be scalable
accessible to the last woman and child directly in their homes
and yet costeffective and resourcelight
And then the mobile phone came to India
and within a few years everyone had a mobile phone
There are currently more mobile phones in India than toilets
The idea then struck me
Why not use a simple technological tool like a mobile phone
which is available in almost every Indian household
to bridge the yawning systemic gaps in health care
Maybe we could have simply called Anita weekly
with critical lifesaving information
On the other hand
maybe we could have provided mobilephonebased training
to the health worker who could have diagnosed Anita's anemia
in the community itself
Thus was born my NGO ARMMAN
Our programs mMitra and Kilkari
are free weekly voice call services
They provide preventive information directly to women
through pregnancy and infancy
in their chosen time slot and language
There are multiple tries for every message
a missedcall system
and mMitra also has a call center
If only Anita had received this service
In the second month of pregnancy itself
it would have told her about the need to take an iron pill daily
from the third month of pregnancy
When the third month arrived
it would have sent her a reminder
and counseled her on how to take the iron pills
For example the need to avoid tea coffee to improve the absorption of iron
and stress on why it is so necessary to prevent anemia
Two weeks later
it would have spoken about how to tackle the adverse effects of iron pills
like constipation
If she had any query
she could have reached out to our call center staff
These are simple voice calls
As a typical doctor
I expected them to just inform
and hopefully lead to better health behaviors
However the one unexpected transformational benefit
that has completely blown my mind is this
Information is empowerment
Armed with this information
women like Anita are upending patriarchal family dynamics
challenging entrenched mores
and demanding care
Karnam the wife of a deeply conservative preacher
convinced her husband to adopt family planning
because mMitra told her
that spacing between pregnancies is necessary
And the change is intergenerational
Punita form a deeply conservative family
sent her daughter to an English medium school
In addition to the big pictured messages
the most underprivileged of women want to know
when their child will understand color
how to ensure psychosocial stimulation of the child
when their child will develop fingers in their womb and so on
Like any woman would
Our services respect that
Over  million women in over  states in India
have enrolled for these services since 
This is testament to how easily scalable and replicable these solutions are
anywhere in the world
Similarly our mHealthbased  refresher training program
for government frontline health workers called Mobile Academy
has trained over  health workers in  states in India
Both Kilkari and Mobile Academy in collaboration with the government
will extend through the country in the next three to five years
Our goal is to be able to reach
over  million women and their children every year
and that would mean
over half of the mothers and children born every year
have the information they need
And this massive scale is only possible
because so many of our partners
be it NGOs hospitals and the government
recognize the value of this approach
and provided the scaffold on which we grew
Our quest in the next five years is to adopt multimedia approaches
and given the massive amounts of data we have
use the power of AI and predictive analytics
to better serve our mothers and children
And our tech platform and the networks we build are nimble
When COVID struck
lockdown was announced overnight
Among the worst affected were the underprivileged women and children
in the slums of Mumbai and Delhi
which were declared as containment zones
However pregnancy and infancy can't wait for a lockdown
When there's an emergency like bleeding care is needed immediately
And we were right there and ready
We repurposed our tech platform within a matter of days
We created a virtual clinic for antenatal pediatric care
manned by qualified doctors
Our callcenter staff arranged logistic support like ambulances
We also sent COVIDspecific information covering pregnancy and infancy
to over  pregnant women and mothers through voice calls
But why should you care about our mothers and children
The pandemic has made us confront this most implacable of truths
A robust primary health care system is an absolute pillar
of a functioning and efficient society
Improvement in maternal and child health
leads to horizontal development of health systems
and improved primary health care
A village that can look after its mothers and children well
can look after all other conditions by ripple effect
And pregnancy is not a disease
Childhood is not an ailment
Dying due to natural life event is not acceptable
and we know why our mothers and children die
Yet we invest so little in preventing their deaths
There can be no global progress
until all our mothers and children do well
I implore you to add your voices to ours
To amplify this message loud and clear
That maternal and child health is a human right
Thank you

I am a linguist
Linguists study language
And we do this in a lot of different ways
Some linguists study how we pronounce certain sounds
Others look at how we build sentences
And some study how language varies from place to place
just to name a few
But what I'm really interested in
is what people think and believe about language
and how these beliefs affect the way we use it
All of us have deeply held beliefs about language
such as the belief that some languages are more beautiful than others
or that some ways of using language are more correct
And as most linguists know
these beliefs are often less about language itself
and more about what we believe about the social world around us
So Im a linguist
and I'm also a nonbinary person
which means I don't identify as a man or a woman
I also identify as a member of a broader transgender community
When I first started getting connected to other transgender people
it was like learning a whole new language
and the linguist part of me was really excited
There was a whole new way of talking about my relationship with myself
and a new clear way to communicate that to other people
And then I started having conversations with my friends and family
about what it meant for me to be trans and nonbinary
what those words meant to me specifically
and why I would use both of them
I also clarified the correct words they could use when referring to me
For some of them this meant some very specific changes
For example some of my friends
who are used to talking about our friend group as ladies or girls
switched to nongendered terms like friends or pals
And my parents can now tell people that their three kids are their son
their daughter and their child
And all of them would have to switch the pronouns they used to refer to me
My correct pronouns are they and them
also known as the singular they
And these people love me
but many of them told me that some of these language changes
were too hard or too confusing
or too ungrammatical for them to pick up
These responses led me to the focus of my research
There are commonly held
yet harmful and incorrect beliefs about language
that for the people who hold these beliefs
act as barriers to building and strengthening relationships
with the transgender people in their families and communities
even if they want to do so
Today I'm going to walk you through some of these beliefs
in the hope that we can embrace creativity in our language
and allow language to bring us closer together
You might see your own beliefs reflected in these experiences in some way
but no matter what
I hope that I can share with you some linguistic insights
that you can put into your back pocket
and take with you out into the world
And I just want to be super clear
This can be fun
Learning about language brings me joy
and I hope that it can bring you more joy too
So do you remember how I said that for some of my friends and family
learning how to use the singular they was really hard
and they said it was too confusing or too ungrammatical for them to pick up
Well this brings us to the first belief about language that people have
Grammar rules don't change
As a linguist I see this belief a lot out in the world
A lot of language users believe that grammar just is what it is
When it comes to language
what's grammatical is what matters
You can't change it
I want to tell you a story about English in the s
Back then as you might imagine
people spoke differently than we do today
In particular they used thou when addressing a single other person
and you when addressing more than one other person
But for some complex historical reasons
that we don't have time to get into today
so you'll just have to trust me as a linguist here
but people started using you to address someone
regardless of how many people they were talking to
And people had a lot to say about this
Take a look at what this guy Thomas Elwood had to say
He wrote
The corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural number
to a single person
you to one instead of thou
contrary to the pure plain and single language of truth
thou to one and you to more than one
And he goes on
Needless to say
this change in pronouns was a big deal in the s
But actually if you followed the debates about the singular they at all
these arguments might sound familiar to you
They're not that far off from the bickering we hear
about the socalled grammaticality of pronouns
used to talk about trans and nonbinary people
One of the most common complaints about the singular they
is that if they is used to refer to people in the plural
it can't also be used to talk about people in the singular
which is exactly what they said about thou and you
But as we have seen pronouns have changed
Our grammar rules do change
and for a lot of different reasons
And we're living through one of these shifts right now
All living languages will continue to change
and the Thomas Elwoods of the world
will eventually have to get with the program
because hundreds of years later
it's considered right to use you when addressing another person
Not just allowable but right
The second belief about language that people have
is that dictionaries provide official unchanging definitions for words
When you were in school
did you ever start an essay with a sentence like
The dictionary defines history as 
Well if you did which dictionary were you talking about
Was it the Oxford English Dictionary
Was it Merriam Webster
Was it Urban Dictionary
Did you even have a particular dictionary in mind
Which one of these is the dictionary
Dictionaries are often thought of as the authority on language
But dictionaries in fact are changing all the time
And here's where our minds are really blown
Dictionaries don't provide a single definition for words
Dictionaries are living documents
that track how some people are using language
Language doesn't originate in dictionaries
Language originates with people
and dictionaries are the documents that chronicle that language use
Here's one example
We currently use the word awful
to talk about something that is bad or gross
But before the th century awful meant just the opposite
People used awful to talk about something
that was deserving of respect
or full of awe
And in the mids
awesome was the word that took up these positive meanings
and awful switched to the negative one we have today
And dictionaries over time reflected that
This is just one example of how definitions and meanings
have changed over time
And to keep up with it how dictionaries are updated all the time
So I hope you're starting to feel a little more comfortable
with the idea of changing language
But of course I'm not just talking about language in general
I'm talking about language as it is impactful for trans people
And pronouns are only one part of language
and they're only one part of language that's important for trans people
Also important are the identity terms
that trans people use to talk about ourselves
such as trans man trans woman nonbinary or gender queer
And some of these words have been documented in dictionaries
for decades now
and others are still being added year after year
And that's because dictionaries are working to keep up with us
the people who are using language creatively
So at this point you might be thinking
But Archie it seems like every trans person has a different word
they want me to use for them
There are so many opportunities for me to mess up or to look ignorant
or to hurt someone's feelings
What is something I can memorize
and reliably employ when talking to the trans people in my life
Well that brings us to the third belief about language that people have
You can't just make up words
Folks people do this all the time
Here's one of my favorite examples
The official term for your mother's mother
or your father's mother is grandmother
I recently polled my friends
and asked them what they call their grandmothers
We don't get frustrated if your friend's grandma goes by Meemaw
and yours goes by Gigi
We just make rather short work of it
and memorize it and move on getting to know her
In fact we might even celebrate her by gifting her with a sweatshirt
or an embroidered pillow that celebrates the name she has chosen for herself
And just like your Nana and your grandma
trans people have every right to choose their own identifying language
The process of determining selfidentifying language
is crucial for trans people
In my research
many trans people have shared that finding new vocabulary
was an important part of understanding their own identities
As one person I interviewed put it
Language is one of the most important personal things
because using different words to describe myself
and then finding something that feels good feels right
is a very introspective and important process
With that process you can piece together
with the language that you find out works best for you
who am I
Sometimes the words that feel good are already out there
For me the words trans and nonbinary just feel right
But sometimes the common lexicon doesnt yet hold
the words that a person needs to feel properly understood
And it's necessary and exciting to get to create and redefine words
that better reflect our experience of gender
So this is a very long answer but yes
I'm absolutely going to give you a magic word
something really easy you can memorize
And I want you to think of this word
as the biggest piece of advice I could give you
if you don't know what words to use for the trans people in your life
Ask
I might be a linguist and a trans person
and a linguist who works with trans people
but I'm no substitute for the actual trans people in your life
when it comes to what words to use for them
And you're more likely to hurt someone's feelings by not asking
or assuming
than you are by asking
And the words that a person uses might change
So just commit to asking and learning
Language is a powerful tool
for explaining and claiming our own identities
and for building relationships that affirm and support us
But language is just that a tool
Language works for us
not the other way around
All of us transgender and cisgender
can use language to understand ourselves
and to respect those around us
We're not bound by what words have meant before
what order they might have come in
or what rules we have been taught
We can consider the beliefs that we might have had
about how language works
and recognize that language will continue to change
And we can creatively use language
to build the identities and relationships that bring us joy
And that's not just allowable
It's right
Believe me

Corey Hajim Here with me today is Beth Ford the CEO of Land O'Lakes
a farming cooperative that works across the United States
and in dozens of countries around the world
And she's going to share with us her vision about how to create
a better future for farmers
that's both environmentally and economically sustainable
Hi Beth thank you so much for being here
Beth Ford Thanks for the invitation I'm looking forward to the conversation
CH Let's first talk about the broadband issue
How big of a problem is this
and how does it affect the farming community
both as you said as families and as businesses
BF So the estimates have been
that  million Americans lack broadband access
 million are in rural America
Now having said that the broadband 
I'm trying to remember what the name of the organization is
did a study and they actually say
the number is more like  million
And the reason is the mapping is inaccurate
So what could happen is
let's say you have a Eleven in a town
and that has WiFi or broadband access because they laid a line
It would show up on the map
as though that community largely has broadband
and it does not
And so it's a significant issue
Think about the education of your children
I know you have three I have three
And many of them were doing remote schooling
Well what's happening on the farm
this is legitimately what's occurring
is that the teacher from the town
is driving paper homework out to the farms
to give them the homework
so that they can continue to go to school
And that's just one example of many
And so this is a major challenge because if we don't have basic wiring
I can say we need like a s' rural electric initiative
where we go across the country
and we make this this should be a right
this should be something that is a basic like mail delivery and electricity
This should not be just for those who have
And the scale of it is
the estimate is to be  to  billion dollars
to close this gap
But the challenge of that is that you get the funding
and then how is it implemented
We all know you can't just say 
I say well I don't go in as CEO go to the board
say I need  million dollars for this tech platform
and then Approved Here's the return
And then I go in and I throw it to the business unit heads and I'm like
You guys decide who's in charge of that right
And there's a little bit about it
it becomes a jump ball between the FCC and the USDA
and then the governors
and suddenly we don't have enough
and we're on the couches looking for quarters and nickels
to pay the pizza guy
so that we can finish this off
as though it's not a priority as though it's not a priority
As though it's somebody else's problem
And it is all of our problem
This is a national security issue
I cannot say it more directly
So it's a major issue because I'm concerned about speed here
in addition to the funding
And the good news is this has been bipartisan support
Whenever I speak I speak for the National Governors Association
the State Department of AG
I mean name it
Name the administration official I've done it
This isn't a bipartisan issue
It has to be a prioritization issue
It has to be something that we decide as a country is a priority
And it means in every state
CH I've heard stories about
Well you've put WiFi
or in some of these communities
they've put WiFi on the buses and then you know
kids are sitting outside the local library or the local McDonald's
to do their homework
And it's just so unfair
BF It's unacceptable
CH Unacceptable Unacceptable is the right word
It also affects the businesses right
Farming as a business
because there's so much technology being used
BF Well there is
So oftentimes I'm at an event
and they're talking about all this cool new tech
And listen I just say we use satellite technology
we have big data data and analytics
John Deere's tractors are autosteer
And I'm like Are you using that
No Why
Well because I lose connection
And so I can't I can't utilize it
You know there's so many exciting investments and innovation
occurring in the sector that will make farmers more efficient
will be better for climate and the environment
I'll talk a little bit about that in a minute
but none of that can be used
if we don't have the appropriate technology access
if we don't have broadband
These are dataintensive models
and they require bandwidth to do so
and to utilize them effectively
So it's a major issue so that from a business perspective
it's an efficiency it's a sustainable production issue
And then back to the community
again stable operating environment
You know I constantly have my mother in my ear
like You're only as happy as your least happy child right
And why is that
Because you know
if you can't feel confident your child has the best education
has access to a doctor
pretty hard to be focused on your business
And farming is a business
And so we have to recognize if there's a number of hospitals
local hospitals have shut down
there's no banking
no housing
It doesn't work to have a stable operating environment
in these farming communities
And yes directly you cannot use the new innovation and technology
that hide the data utilization if you do not have broadband
CH So the technology is a challenge
and as you said it's so important for the business
and you mentioned climate
So I'd love to dive into that
because in addition to sort of challenging market dynamics
you also have climate volatility and an increasing weather volatility
and technology's helping to address that
Can you talk a little bit about the technology
that's being used by farmers to manage that volatility
BH Well first of all what you're helping them do
is make improved decisions that make their farms more resilient
and that they can make more sustainable business practices
So what we've started
we have a business called Truterra
it's run by Jason Weller
who used to run in our CS under the Obama administration
And what this business does it works in multiple ways
We work through our local retailer the agronomists
They get insights from our Truterra insights engine
It literally is at the farm level
acre by acre
where they can understand what the soil type is
what the water situation is all of those things
what kind of tractor do you use
how many passes at the field do you make
So we can make improved
sustainable production decisions
More recently probably just last week we announced our Trucarbon platform
which is a systemic way that we can work with farmers databased
This is partnered with the Soil Health Institute
with many environmental groups
to create a carbon credit
So where the farmer is making a decision that is improving carbon capture
and at the same time is improving their own profitability
and then is able to monetize that
Our first customer was Microsoft
and they're using this for carbon credit
So why is this so important
In addition to the fact that we have validation
and this is an evolving marketplace
carbon and carbon credits carbon offsets
it's an unstructured pricing environment
And I think all the studies would show that agriculture is a great way
for us to address this issue using basic photosynthesis
So if we if we agree that
then we have to say what is that pricing environment
One of the fundamental things we started with is the farmer
In fact Secretary Vilsack more recently said in his confirmation hearing
we've got to start with the farmer
and that farmer has to be profitable when making that decision
It's a virtuous circle
So we want the farmer to take action
But you can't just say Everybody put on cover crops
That's the best
Because then that farmer isn't profitable
and then how do we make sure that we can sustain our food production
and the farm
So we're working with this inside engine
with our agronomic advice
with soil health and soil testing
with any number of pieces of data and process and expertise
And that's what differentiates I think our approach
that it goes right back to the farm level
but leverages technology
We have a partnership with Microsoft
their FarmBeats program their airband
They're working with us
on closing this digital divide in different communities
so we can take advantage of these opportunities
And at the same time as I said
they were our first customer for our carbon credits
And one of the reasons I'm so focused on this
not just because this is an evolving marketplace
and because climate change is something we have to address
and we want to address
and I believe farmers are part of the solution
They are a major part and a major opportunity for solution
It also is another revenue source for farmers
And go back to that statistic I gave you about the hobby farmer
about the fact that they're working off the farm to retain their farms
And the reality is there's going to be even more disruption
in the coming years in this sector
It will be in some ways driven
by the electrification of the transportation sector
That means biofuel utilization
and a significant portion of the corn crop goes into biofuels ethanol
And if that is no longer needed
because we've gone to electric vehicles over the next  years
what happens to corn price to land values
And at the same time soybeans
some of that is used for biodiesel
So that will be a major disruptor to row crop farming
So we've got to point farmers they're pretty smart
to the right levels of investment they can make
for other sources of potential revenue for their farms
And I think that this is a great way to think about it
CH Right so you feel like
the things that farmers can do to be more environmentally sustainable
can also help them economically
BF Exactly And it must
It must
And that's why this model that we have Truterra Insights Engine
is iterative almost
Hey if I do these three things what happens to my profitability
And it might be tied to a program that's available at the state level
it might be tied to improve variable rate application of your fertilizer
where you don't put everything on at the same time
and then have it seep into the soil
Instead you look and you use your satellite technology and everything
and you say Oh I'm going to put partial on now
and maybe I don't need as much later
Every piece every acre on a farm is not the same
and doesn't have the opportunity to yield as much
one acre to the next
And with that then
where do you make the right investments
And a model like this helps you understand where to make those investments
We also have applied research plots
answer plots where we help with our agronomists
to help improve the planting decisions a farmer may make
So there's any number of variables
and I say it makes a farm more resilient
And let's agree
we're going to get into a situation where the financial markets
and the bankers are going to say
you need to be making investments that make your farm more resilient
given the amount of disruption we're seeing already right
Climate
Think of the fires in the west the freeze in the south in Texas
and we're going to see these events over the next number of years
We have to make the farm more resilient
That makes it more profitable for the farmer
It helps their ability to make an investment
that we all know is necessary
CH But you mentioned that it can also be a revenue source
Can you give an example of how you know
a climate mitigation technique
also provides revenue for a farmer
BF Well there's two things
One I was just mentioning more directly this true carbon
where you're generating a carbon credit
because you're able to prove
the new practices you're putting in place is going to reduce that
You use that proof for the soil test in advance
and then a number of years later
You may use a stabilizer for instance
and that would mean that you don't have some of your nitrogen you're putting on
or using kind of seep into the soil
That in and of itself
means you have less of investment you have to make in those products
as you're putting on fertilizer
or planting different crops
But then more directly that credit that you develop
because this market is evolving
can be sold
So what we're doing with the Microsoft partnership here and their purchases
if you are able to prove this tonnage reduction
it's like  dollars a met ton for carbon credit
so it's a more direct line payment for that in and of itself
And that's an evolving marketplace we're going to see
We're also partnered with Nori it's a platform like eBay
and they want to be the eBay of carbon credit trading
This is very early stage but it's an exciting opportunity
because we know it's going to take this kind of innovation this creation
this technology to address climate change
And the farmers can be in a position
where they can be part of the solution
CH Thanks for being here Beth
BF You bet

I am unabashedly a daddy's girl
My daddy is the first person to have told me that I was beautiful
He often told me that he loved me
and he was one of my favorite people in the entire world
which was why it was really challenging
to discover that we had a deep ideological divide
that was so sincere and so deep
that caused me to not talk to him for  years
Before the term was coined
I canceled my father
In the last few years
cancel culture has of course come into great prominence
It's existed throughout time
but cancel culture in the bigger society
is when a person in prominence says or does something
that we the people disagree with
and the decision is made to make them persona non grata
They are done
They are not to be revered
They are not to be a part of our world anymore
And that is in the public realm
I'm going to talk to you today about the private realm
When we choose to cancel the people in our circle
the people in our core
the people who love us and who we love
and it has been mutually beneficial
but due to a deep and sincere ideological divide
we make the decision to cancel them out of our lives
I want to suggest that cancel culture needs to change
and instead we need to move to compassion culture
But before I go there
let me tell you two of the premises that exist
when we indulge in cancel culture
One we have to believe that we're right
A hundred percent
no possibility of being wrong
And two the other person
the person we're going to cancel
clearly does not have the ability
to change to grow to develop
Obviously both of these are problematic
because sometimes we're not right
I don't know about you but there have been times in my life
when I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was right
only to discover that I was wrong
badly wrong completely missed the mark
So if it could happen to me and perhaps it's happened to you
perhaps it could happen to others
The second is a little even more challenging
because I know that I've changed over the years
Haven't we all
Though the core parts of Betty have pretty much stayed the same
there have been key elements that have changed drastically
The Betty of eight years old was not the same as the Betty of 
which was not the same as  which was not the same as 
I've changed
And if I'm able to change
shouldn't I extend grace to believe that others can change too
So what should we do
Instead of canceling people we should use the tool called compassion
I find the definition of compassion is a fascinating one
And it's not one that I hear people talk about
Compassion means to suffer with someone
To suffer alongside them
Imagine
When someone say Grandpa
says that thing that's caused you to decide
he's no longer invited to Thanksgiving
what if instead we chose to suffer alongside him
We decided that our love was so big so deep so strong
that we were willing to suffer
even when it could be potentially painful
Now let's be clear
I am not denying anyone's right to cancel anyone else
What I'm suggesting is that maybe that's not the best way
When we think about the situation with Grandpa at Thanksgiving
if we choose to cancel him
we are no longer in proximity to him
Not only do we not get to hear his point of view
we don't get to share ours
What if we're the only person
because of our deep connection and love and affection for our grandfather 
and substitute anyone you choose
What if we're the ones to plant seeds of change
seeds of influence
seeds of difference
Now to be fair
I cannot promise you that just because you plant the seed
that it will get water
that it'll get any sunlight or even a little fertilizer
But what I can tell you is that if you don't plant it
who will
I find it interesting
this idea of suffering alongside someone
It means that we are choosing to value the totality of the person
rather than one particular aspect
like a framework or a mindset or a belief system
We're choosing to believe that the entire person is more valuable
than any of the individual parts
And I found an amazing duo who demonstrated this beautifully
Perhaps you've heard of them
The late justices
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia
were close close friends
And they were completely divided in terms of belief systems
In fact Antonin Scalia once said
What's not to like other than her thoughts on the law
He believed she was wrong
She believed he was wrong
They did not shift in that point of view whatsoever
And yet they had tea together every week
and every New Year's Eve
they spent it together with their families
They went on family vacations together
They chose to suffer with each other rather
than to cancel each other
Their love and respect for each other
continued to grow
even though they never saw eye to eye
I imagine that curiosity might be a part of that
That if we choose to be curious about that which is different
we might discover something along the way
After all if we are who we are because of our lived experiences
isn't that true for someone else
And have we ever decided to use that tool of empathy
of walking a mile or so in someone else's shoes
to really discover the context for why they believe what they believe
Now by now you're probably saying
Yeah OK Betty this sounds good
But what about you
What about you and your dad
It's a fair question
After  years of not talking to my dad
I picked up the phone one day called him and said
I bet if it were up to you
you'd probably go back in time and change some things
I know I would
But since we can't
how about we start again
And he said
Yes because I love you
I always have And I always will
I am so grateful that I made that call
because there was no way for me to know
that a few years later my dad would develop Alzheimer's
And a few years after that he would die
And we never saw eye to eye about the thing that divided us
ever
But our love continued
It continued through those  years when we didn't speak
and it continued in the six years after
So I am encouraging us to become a society of people
that choose compassion over canceling
I'm asking us to consider
that curiosity might be a better practice
That we might choose empathy
that we might choose to have a love that is so deep so wide
so strong that it can surpass differences
Why are we so scared of differences anyway
I also want us to be a people that plant seeds
seeds of change seeds of influence
seeds of diversity
Again I cannot promise to you or anyone else
that planting that seed is going to make a difference
But what if it does
I am the sum of who I am
because of everything that I've been exposed to
My mind has changed over the years
and grown because of the people in my life who planted seeds in me
some that I saw and some that I didn't
So wouldn't it be great
if instead of having a cancel culture
we create a compassion culture
where we are willing to suffer alongside the ones we love
because we love them
And can't we become a community that plants seeds
After all if we don't who will
Thank you

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
Not too long ago a mother told me
I can talk to my son in the dark
[Operator voice The prepaid collect call from an inmate at ]
Her son was in prison
and paying for phone calls often meant she couldn't afford her light bill
See families can pay as much as a dollar a minute
to speak to a loved one in prison or jail
These egregious rates
have created a billiondollar prison telecom industry
and with visit costs
forced one in three families with an incarcerated loved one into debt
Eightyseven percent of those carrying this financial burden are women
And as a result of decades of racist policies and policing
they're disproportionately Black and brown
Prison telecom corporations claim that these high rates are necessary
to pay site commissions to prisons and jails
and provide security and surveillance
While the government's hands are far from clean
these corporate claims are simply not supported by reality
Consider this
In Connecticut
where families are charged as much as  cents per minute
and the state takes a  percent commission
the telecom provider takes home  cents per minute
Now in Illinois where the state takes no commission
families pay the same corporation nine tenths of a cent per minute
In other words even after the government takes its cut
the corporation makes  times more in Connecticut than it does in Illinois
for providing the same service
And prisons in Illinois are no less secure than those in Connecticut
These are simply corporate arguments
used to justify predatory business practices
and distract from the very simple truth
Corporations in the prison industry
have a financial interest in seeing more people behind bars
and for longer periods of time
In reality providing families and their incarcerated loved ones
with regular communication
is not just the right thing to do
It's also the most fiscally responsible and safe thing to do
If you think taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook
for phone calls for people who have committed crimes
remember this
The most expensive rates are charged in jails
where the majority of people are awaiting trial and not yet convicted
Prison wages range from nothing to a few cents an hour
so it's hard working taxpaying families that are paying for calls
And maintaining strong community ties is one of the most important factors
in a person's successful reentry upon release
It improves housing employment and social outcomes
making it less likely that people need government support
or end up back in prison
The bottom line is that prison telecom corporations
and the thousands of others in the prison industry
prioritize profit as they promote the caging of people
to exploit them and their families
See prison telecom is just one sector in the billiondollar prison industry
When I say prison industry
I'm talking about food service corporations
that serve rotten meat to people behind bars
health care providers that deny incarcerated people care
and architecture firms that design windowless sixbyninefoot cells
for solitary confinement
where people spend weeks months and even years
We invest in these corporations
through our retirement funds public pensions
university endowments and private foundations
and we celebrate their executives
on the boards of our favorite cultural institutions
And in all fairness it's not just the private sector
It's also government agencies that charge excessive fines and fees
and abuse free or grossly underpaid prison labor
to manufacture license plates
staff DMV call centers fight wildfires
and yes even pick cotton
So this begs the question
how can we address our crisis of mass incarceration
if an entire segment of our economy is fighting to put more people behind bars
and for longer
We can't
But we can demand and create change
The key is running coordinated policy and corporate campaigns
That's the playbook I put to use when I founded Worth Rises
a nonprofit prison abolition organization
dedicated to dismantling the prison industry
Let's go back to prison telecom for a quick example
In  we led a campaign in New York City
that passed the first piece of legislation to make jail phone calls free
saving families with incarcerated loved ones
nearly  million dollars a year
and increasing communication by roughly  percent overnight
In 
we helped local advocates in San Francisco introduce a similar policy
and launched several statewide campaigns to do the same
That same year
we fought the consolidation of two major market players
in front of the Federal Communications Commission and won
We blocked milliondollar investment by a public pension
with a private equity firm that owned a prison telecom corporation
And we removed one of the largest investors in the field
from a major museum board
In just two years
we toxified the industry and threatened its business model
causing an investor selloff
But more importantly
that means millions of families connected
and billions of dollars protected
from the predatory hands of prison profiteers
It means fewer dollars invested in and promoting human caging and control
And it means at least one mother won't have to sit in the dark
to talk to her son again
[Operator You may start the conversation now]
Thank you

Hello everyone
I'm here to help you design your life
We're going to use the technique of design thinking
Design thinking is something we've been working on at the dSchool
and in the School of Engineering for over  years
and it's an innovation methodology works on products works on services
But I think the most interesting design problem is your life
So that's what we're going to talk about
I want to just make sure everybody knows this is my buddy Dave Evans his face
Dave and I are the coauthors of the book
and he is the guy who helped me cofound the Life Design Lab at Stanford
So what do we do in the Life Design Lab
Well we teach the class that helps to figure out
what you want to be when you grow up
Now I'm going to give you the first reframe
Designers love reframes
How many of you hope you never grow up and lose that childlike curiosity
that drives everything you do
Raise your hand Right Who wants to grow up
I mean we've been talking about curiosity in almost every one of these talks
And so I'd like to reframe this as
we say we teach the class that helps you figure out
what you want to grow into next
as this life of yours this amazing design of yours unfolds
So design thinking is what we teach
and it's a set of mindsets it's how designers think
You know we've been taught probably in the university
to be so skeptical realists rationalists
but that's not very useful as a mindset when you're trying to do something new
something no one's ever done before
So we say you start with curiosity and you lean into what you're curious about
We say you reframe problems because most of the time
we find people are working on the wrong problems
and they have a wonderful solution to something that doesn't work anyway
So what's the point of working on the wrong thing
We say radical collaboration
because the answer's out in the world with other people
That's where your experience of your life will be
We want to be mindful of our process
There are times in the design process when you want lots of ideas
and there are times when you really want to converge test some things
prototype some things you want to be good at that
And the other is biased action
Now you know I'll say that we think
no plan for your life will survive first contact with reality
Laughter
Reality has the tendency to throw little things at us that we weren't expecting
sometimes good things sometimes bad
So we say just have a biased action try stuff
Why Why did we start this class
I've been in office hours for a long long time with my students
I've been teaching here for a while Dave as well
He was teaching over that community college in Berkeley for a while
Laughter
And 
I'm sorry I'm sorry it's a Stanford TEDx
But we notice that people get stuck
People really get stuck and then they don't know what to do
and they don't seem to have any tools for getting unstuck
Designers get stuck all the time
I signed up to be a designer
which means I'm going to work on something I've never done every day
and I get stuck and unstuck stuck and unstuck all the time
We also noticed as we went out and talked to folks who are not just our students
but people in midcareer and encore careers
that people have a bunch of beliefs
which psychologists label dysfunctional beliefs
things they believe that are true that actually aren't true
and it holds them back
I'll give you three
First one is What's your passion
Tell me your passion and I'll tell you what you need to do
Now if you actually have one of these things these passions 
you knew at two you wanted to be a doctor
you knew at seven you wanted to be a clown at Cirque du Soleil
and now you are one that's awesome
But we're a sort of research space here at Stanford
so we went over to the Center for the Study of Adolescence
which by the way now goes up to  
Laughter
and met with Bill Damon one of our colleagues a fantastic guy
He studied this question and it turns out less than  of the people
have any one single identifiable passion in their lives
We hate a methodology which says OK come to the front of the line
You have a passion Oh you don't Oh I'm sorry
When you have one come on back and we'll help you with that
It's terrible eight out of  people say I have lots of things I'm interested in
So this is not an organizing principle for your search or your design
The second one is Well you should know by now right
Don't you know where you're going
If you don't know you're late
Laughter
Now what are you late for exactly
I'm not quite sure
But you know there's a metanarrative in the culture and when I was growing up
by  you're supposed to maybe have a relationship
maybe have gotten married and started to get the family together
When I talk to my millennial students they'll say
Oh that's got to be like  or something
because they can't imagine anything past like 
but  is a long way out
But we know that now these people are forming their lives much more fluidly
they are staying in a lot more dynamic motion between about  and 
and so this notion that you're late is really kind of like
Well you should have figured this out by now
Dave and I don't should on anybody
In the book or in the class we don't believe in should
We just think Alright you are whatever you are
Let's start from where you are You're not late for anything
But the one we really don't like is
Are you being the best possible version of you
Laughter
I mean because you're not settling
for something that's less than the best because this is Stanford
Obviously we all are going to be the best
Well this implies that one there's a singular best
two that it's a linear thing and life is anything but linear
and three it kind of comes from this business notion
there's an old business saying
Good is the enemy of better better is the enemy of best
and you always want to do your best in business
But if there isn't one singular best then our reframe is
The unattainable best is the enemy of all the available betters
because there are many many versions of you that you could play out
all of which would result in a welldesigned life
So I'm going to give you three ideas from design thinking 
five ideas excuse me  That says five doesn't it Yeah
Five ideas from design thinking
And people who've read the book or taken the class
have written back to us and said
Hey these were the most useful these were the most doable
they were the most helpful
And we're humancentered designers so we want to be helpful
The first one is this notion of connecting the dots
The number one reason people take our class and we hear read the book
is they say You know I want my life to be meaningful
I want it to be purposeful I want it to add up to something
So we looked in the positive psychology literature and in the design literature
and it turns out
that there's who you are there's what you believe
and there's what you do in the world
and if you can make a connection between these three things
if you can make that a coherent story
you will experience your life as meaningful
The increase in meaningmaking comes from connecting the dots
So we do two things
We ask people Write a work view What's your theory of work
Not the job you want but why do you work What's it for
What's work in service of
Once you have that  words then  this one's a little harder to get short
What's the meaning of life What's the big picture Why are you here
What is your faith or your view of the world
When you can connect your life view and your work view together
in a coherent way
you start to experience your life as meaningful
That's the idea number one
Idea number two people get stuck
and you've got to be careful because we can reframe almost anything
but there's a class of problems that people get stuck on
that are really really bad problems
We call them gravity problems
Essentially they're something you cannot change
Now I know you have a friend
and you've been having coffee with this friend for a while
and they're stuck
They don't like their boss their partner their job
there's something that they don't like
But nothing's happening right Nothing's happening with them
If Dave were here he'd say Look
you can't solve a problem you're not willing to have
You can't solve a problem you're not willing to have
so if you've got a gravity problem
and you're simply not willing to work on it
then it's just a circumstance in your life
And the only thing we know to do with gravity problems is to accept
In the design thinking chart you start with empathy
then you redefine the problem you come up with lots of ideas
then you prototype and test things
but that only works if it's a problem you're willing to work on
The first thing to do is accept and once you've accepted this as gravity problem 
I can't change it
You know this is a company
the company is a familyrun company and the name of the founder is on the door
and if you're not in the family you can't be the president
You're right you can't
So now you have to decide what you want to do
Is that a circumstance that you can reframe and work in
or do you need to do something else
So be really careful about gravity problems
because they're pernicious and they really get in the way
But back to this idea of multiples
I do a little thought experiment with my students
and I say you know
The physicists up in SLAC have kind of demonstrated
this multiverse thing might be real
You've heard of this that there are multiple parallel universes
one right next to each other
And say We'll do a thought experiment
Let's say you could live in all the multiverses simultaneously
and not only that but you'd know about your life in each one of these instances
So you could go back and be the ballerina
and the scientist and the CPA and whatever else you wanted to be
You could have all these lives in parallel
When I ask them How many lives are you How many lives would you want
I get answers from three to 
But you know we've sort of done the average it's about 
Most people think they have about  really good lives that they could live
And here's the deal you only get one
But it turns out it's not what you don't choose
it's what you choose in life that makes you happy
Nevertheless we reframed this and we say
Great there's more lives than one in you
So let's go on an odyssey and let's really figure out those lives
And we ask people to do some design
And the ideate bubble it's about having lot's of ideas
So we say Let's have some ideas
We'll ideate your future but you can't ideate just one
You have to ideate three
Now there's some research from the School of Education
that says if you start with three ideas and you brainstorm from there
you've got a much wider range of ideas
the ideas are more generative
and they lead to better solutions to the problem
rather than just starting with one and then brainstorming forward
So we always do threes there's something magical about threes
We have people do three lives and it's transformational
We give them this little rubric
One The thing you're doing
the thing you're doing right now whatever your career is just do it
And you're going to do it for five years and it's going to come out great
I mean in design we're sort of valuesneutral
except for one thing we never design anything to make it worse right
I have been on some teams that made some pretty bad products
but we weren't trying to we were trying to make it better
So thing one your life make it better
And also put in the bucket list stuff
you want to go to Paris to the Galapagos 
the guy with the ice thing 
before it's all under water and we can't see it anymore
So that's plan one your life goes great
Plan two
I'm really sorry to tell you but the robots and the AI stuff 
that job doesn't exist anymore the robots are doing it
We don't need you to do that anymore
Now what are going to do
So what do you do if the thing that you've got goes away
And you know everybody's got a side hustle or something they can do
to make that work
And three is what's your wildcard plan
What would you do if you didn't have to worry about money You've got enough
You're not fabulously wealthy but you've got enough
And what would you do if you knew no one would laugh
My students come in for my office hours a lot of times
and they'll say something like
Well what I really want to do is this but I can't just hear people saying
'You didn't go to Stanford to do that did you'
Laughter
Because somehow if you went to Stanford
you have to do some of the amazing things the past speakers have been doing
But what would you do if you had enough money
and you didn't care what people thought
Anything from 'I'm going to go study butterflies'
to 'I want to be a bartender you know in Belize' What would you do
And people have those three plans
Now what happens when they do this is one they realize
Oh my gosh I could actually have imagined
my three completely parallel lives are all pretty interesting
Two they rarely go become a bartender you know in Belize
But a lot of times the things that come up in the other plans
were things that they left behind somehow
In the business of life they forgot about those things
And so they bring them back and put them in plan one
then they make their lives even better
Sometimes they do pivot
but mostly they just use this as a method of ideating
all the possible wonderful ways they could have a life
Now you could start executing that
but in our model the thing you do after you have ideas is you build a prototype
We have met people who've quit their job and suddenly done something else
It hardly ever works
You kind of have to sneak up on it because in our model
we want to set the bar really low try stuff have some success do it again
So when we say prototype in our language
what we mean is a way to ask an interesting question
What would it be like if I tried this
a way to expose the assumptions
Is this even the thing I want
or is that just something I remember I wanted when I was 
I've got to go out in the world and do this
so I'm going to get others involved in prototyping my life
and I'm going to sneak up on the future
because I don't if this is exactly what I want
There's two kinds of lifedesign prototypes
and what we call prototype conversation
You know William Gibson the sciencefiction writer
has a famous quote
The future is already here It's just unevenly distributed
So there is someone who's a bartender in Ibiza
He's been doing it for years I could go meet him and have a conversation
he or she
Somebody else is doing something else I'm interested in
All of these people are out there they're living in my future today
They're doing what I want to do today
And if I have a conversation with them
I just ask for their story and everybody will tell you their story
If you buy them a cup of coffee they tell you the story
If I hear something in the story that rings in me 
We have this thing we call narrative resonance
when I hear a story that's kind of like my story something happens
and I can identify that as a potential way of moving forward
The other one is a prototype experience
Dave and I were working with a woman
sort of midcareer in her s and a very successful tech executive
but wanted to move from moneymaking to meaningmaking
to do something more meaningful
thinking of going back to school getting an MA in education
working with kids
But she's like You know I don't know I'm  going back to school
It's not going to work
And then I heard about these millennials
They're kind of mean and they don't like old people
Laughter
What am I going to do Bill
I said Well you just have to go try this you know
It turns out we sent her to a seminar class
and to a large lecturehall class
and by the way you just put on a Tshirt that says Stanford
and you walk into a class nobody knows
She wasn't registered but you know she went and she went to the classes
and she came back and said You know what It was fantastic
I walked into the lecture hall I sat down my body was on fire
It was interesting I was so interested in the way the lecture was going
And then I met these millennials
It turned out they're pretty interesting people
I've set up three prototype conversations
And they think I'm interesting because I'm coming back to school and I'm 
So she had a felt experience because we are more than just our brains
She had a felt experience that this might work for her
So these are two ways you can prototype your way forward
The last idea
you want to make a good decision well
So many people make choices and they're not happy with their choices
because they don't really know how do they know what they know right
It's a hard thing particularly in our days when we have so many choices
So we have a process
Again it comes from the positive psychology guys
Gather and create options
Once you get good at design you're really good at coming up with options
You've got narrow those down to a working list that you can work with
Then you make the choice to make a good choice
and then of course you agonize that you did the wrong thing
Laughter
All my students have what is called FOMO fear missing out
What if I didn't pick the right thing
Someone came into my office and said I'll declare three majors and two minors
and I said Do you plan on being here for a few years
It's not going to happen right
So we don't say that we say you want to let go and move on
and all these have some psychological basis in them
Let me tell you about it
Once you get good at gathering and creating ideas
you also want to make sure you leave room for the lucky ideas
the serendipitous ideas
This is a guy named Tony Hsieh
He was the CEO at Zappos he sold it to Amazon
But before you became an employee at Zappos you had to take a test
and the test was Are you lucky
One two or three I'm not very lucky and I'm not sure why
Seven eight nine ten I'm very lucky great things happen to me all the time
I'm not sure why
He wouldn't hire anybody who was not lucky
Laughter
I think it's probably illegal but it was based on 
Laughter
but it was based on a piece of research where psychologists did the same thing
Rate yourself from lucky to unlucky
And then they had people read the front section of the New York Times
 pages lots of articles
And the graduate students said
Please count the number of 
either headlines or photographs depending on the test
And when you get the whole thing read and you count the number of photographs
just tell the person at the end
And if you got the right number you'd get 
Of course you all know
when a graduate student tells you what the experiment is that's not the experiment
So inside this thing that looked like the New York Times
 pages front page
inside all the stories were little pieces of text that said
If you read this the experiment's over Collect an extra  
People who rated themselves as unlucky by and large got the right answer
 headlines whatever it was
got the  
People who rated themselves as lucky  seven eight nine or ten 
 of the time noticed the text and got the extra 
It's not about being lucky
It's about paying attention to what you're doing
and keeping your peripheral vision open because it's in your peripheral vision
that those interesting opportunities show up right
that you were not expecting
So you want to get good at being lucky
Narrowing down This is quite simple
If you have too many choices you go into what psychologists call choice overload
and then you have essentially no choices
Here's the experiment This was done at Stanford
You walk into a grocery store and there's a nice lady
She's got a table and on the table she has six jams
and you come over try the jams to have a sample buy some jam
Six jams about  people who would go by pick a jam
or stop and test something
and about a third of those actually buy a jam
That's the baseline
Next week you walk in  jams
jalapeo strawberry banana whatever all sorts of jams
Well guess what happens
Twice as many people stop look at all these jams
it's so interesting
Three percent of the people buy them
Laughter
When you have too many choices you have no choice
What do you do when you have too many choices
Just cross off a bunch of choices
Psychologists tells us we can't handle more than five to seven
I'd say it's five
If you've got a bunch of choices cross them all off
just pick the five and then make your decision there
Oh my God What if I pick the wrong ones What if I cross off the wrong ones
Right
Well you won't because it's the pizza or Chinese food thing
You're at the office and everybody says Let's go out to lunch today
Sounds great What do you want to do Pizza or Chinese food I don't care
In the elevator on their way down someone says Let's get Chinese food
Then you go No I want pizza
Laughter
You won't decide how you feel about the decision till the decision's made
That's a piece of research that's been done again and again and again
So just cross them off
If you cross off the wrong one
you'll have a feeling somewhere in your stomach that you did the wrong thing
Choosing  this is about that feeling in your stomach
You cannot choose well if you choose only from your rational mind
This is Dan Goleman who wrote the book on emotional intelligence
He does a lot of research on this a lot of brain science
There's a part of your brain
way down in the base brain the basal ganglia
that summarizes emotional decisions for you
I did something got good emotional response from that good check
I did something and had a little bad emotional response to that
It summarizes all of the emotions that you have felt
and how your decisions were valenced positive or negative an emotion
The problem with that part of your brain is that it's so early in the brain
it doesn't talk to the part of your brain that talks
There's no connection to the prefrontal cortex or anything else
It's only connected to your GI tract and your limbic system
So it gives you information through felt sensations
a gut feeling
Without that you can't make good decisions
And then the letting go and moving on
This was the hardest part for me but this is also the work of Dan Gilbert
who is a distinguished scientist at Harvard
despite the fact that he's doing insurance commercials now
And he's been studying decisionmaking and how do you make yourself happy
So you walk in another psychology experiment
The postdoc has got five Monet prints five pictures from Monet
and you rank them from best to least
I like this one the most I like this one the least
number one and number five
Thank you very much the experiment's over
Oh by the way as you're walking out you know
I kind of screwed up and I bought too many of number two and three
So if you want to take one home you can just have it
Two conditions in one case take it home and have it
but don't bring it back because I'm kind of embarrassed and 
Just keep it you can't exchange it
Second condition I've got lots of these
If you don't like the one you picked
you can swap it back and pick another one
And of course everybody picks number two It's a little better than number three
We bring people back in a week later and say
Rerank the stimuli Which one do you like now
The people who were allowed to change their mind don't like their painting
they don't like the print
they don't like the other one anymore they don't like any of them anymore
In fact they don't like the whole process
and they have destroyed their opportunity to be happy
Laughter
The people who were told You pick it it's yours you can't return it
love their print they typically rank it as number one
and think the rest of them suck
Laughter
If you make decisions reversible
your chance of being happy goes down like  or  percent
So let go and move on make the decision reversible
And by the way as a designer that's no problem
because you're really good at generating options
you're great at ideation
you're really good at prototyping to get data in the world
to see of that world will be the world you want to live in
so you have no fear of missing out
It's just a process a mindful process collect reduce decide move on
That's how you make yourself happy
So
the five ideas
Connecting the dots to find meaning through work and life views
Stay away from gravity problems because I can't fix those and neither can you
reframe those to something that is workable
Do three plans never one always do three of everything
three ideations for any of the problems you're working on
to make sure that you've covered not just the ideas that you had when you started
but all the other ideas that are possible
Prototype everything in your life before you jump in and try it
And choose well there's no point in making a good choice poorly
Choose well and you will find that things in your life are much easier
And you can do this we know you can
because thousands of students have done it
Two PhD studies have been done in the class
that demonstrated higher selfefficacy lower dysfunctional beliefs
It's a fascinating process to watch people who don't think of themselves as creative
go through this class and walk out saying
You know what I'm a pretty creative person
what David Kelly calls creative confidence
So we know you can do it thank you very much
It's simple
get curious
talk to people
and try stuff
and you will design a welllived and joyful life
Thank you
Applause Cheers

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
I want you to take this journey with me
Let's set the stage
It's a Sunday in Baltimore
There could be kids in the park Druid Hill
They're watching dirt bike riders go pass
do tricks pop wheelies do stunts
they're zipping
If you hear the engines revving smell the gasoline
you can see the joy and excitement on their face
Someones probably learning how to fix their dirt bike
because the parts are way too expensive to buy
Then they can go to school
They can get a pop quiz or a test from a teacher
You know the kind we all heard and we've all hated
A train that's leaving from New York
goes to Cleveland
but they're here in Baltimore
How does this relate
They don't get it
They fail the test and now they can hate school
Then their world can be turned upside down
They can get on Facebook on Instagram
get a call or a text
They can watch as their friend can become a hashtag
a kid in the wrong place at the wrong time
Lost to the streets lost to the system
or lost to gun violence
Or a kid that could be arrested for a dirt bike
Because in my city
it can be a misdemeanor for possession of a dirt bike
This can be a likely story for Black kids across the country
In cities like Miami Cleveland Atlanta Philly
whatever place had the dirt bike task force
Now ask yourself if the thing you use to relieve your stress
if it was demonized
would you still do it
If it was criminalized
The answer is yes
That's the reality for Black people across the US right now
Theyve watched as we made room in cities for skateboarders for bicyclists
and any other sport
They can watch TV and see it on X Games the Olympics or ESPN
The style of riding can be seen in ad campaigns and films
But in Baltimore what do they have to look forward to
What do riders get from all of it
No space no outlet
just a typical narrative
Like I said this is a common story
I was the kid in a park
I wanted to be just like the big dirtbike riders
but I hate to fall
Instead I became like Bill Nye The Science Guy
I was doing all kinds of experiments blowing my eyebrows off
gluing people to the chair
and I may or may not have made stink bombs at school
They would describe me as another bad kid
What they didn't see was all my genius my talent
my voice was not heard
Then I became that Black girl from West Baltimore working in STEM
My first position I was confused for the secretary
I was pissed
But it lit a fire in me
So I want to get more people in the industry
And in  that's what I started doing
Working in small groups with kids and students
teaching them STEM activities
Then in 
I lost my little brother to the prison system
In  I lost all faith in the system period
The world watched the following of Freddie Gray uprising
as Baltimore burned
I wondered when were people going to listen
where were the solutions
And where was the investment into my community
In  I broke the system
and became the founder and CEO of B
carving out a new lane
I went back to my experience in the park
I thought about the kids fixing their bikes
Those are skills people use to pay the bills
just like mechanics and mechanical engineers
We leaned into STEM
S  Science
The science behind popping the best wheelie
pulling your dirt bike at twelve o'clock
is a physics equation
T  Technology
The technology needed to get the best radial tires
so you don't have frictional asphalt
E  Engineering
The engineering needed to fix or peg a dirt bike
but to also get the best mac mac noise
M  Mathematics
The math needed for the gas to oil ratio
so your dirt bike does not explode
Then I took it a step further
I thought about the riders
I knew the only way to have program and solutions
was to have them at the table
Because the people closest to the problem are the solution
I thought about Mike
Since he was six he's been riding dirt bikes
When he was  graduating high school
he didn't know what he wanted to do
but he knew he loved everything about dirt bikes
He started working with us in B
he's helped us educate kids
train dirt bike riders
and at  he's our lead instructor
He's created events
he's traveled across the country
and he really represents the best of B
At the core of our work
is constantly thinking about what people like Mike want
For Mike he wants a space
A space where he can keep working with students on our curriculum
a space where he can keep training more riders
and growing their skill sets
a space where he no longer has to escape
but he has something in his own city for him
With your support and the support of more cities
we can make this a reality
Since 
we've saved the city of Baltimore about  million dollars
by doing programing for over  students
We've saved the city of Baltimore one million dollars
by growing work force and opportunities for people just like Mike
That's less people that could possibly go to jail
less money spent on dollars and cents of incarceration
and more money going back into our Black communities our leaders
our culture and our voices
We don't need your black squares
we don't need your campaigns
but what we do need is your dollars and cents behind us
to make real change
We need more people like you in cities
to believe in investing in us and our model of growing the people
What will you choose to be
An ally
Be an impact
Be the revolution
B
Thank you

I work in aviation but the truth is I don't much like flying
Current commercial flights are inconvenient
noisy expensive and use ancient plane designs
that have hardly changed from the s
It also represents my biggest personal impact on the environment
just as it does for many of us who fly multiple times a year
Aviation will continue to face fierce headwinds globally
even after the pandemic subsides
because flying is becoming the symbol of a polluting lifestyle
Pressure is growing to decarbonize planes or even cease flying altogether
But the great news is
that a change which will reroute our industry's flight path
into fresh tailwinds
has already begun and is gathering speed
This change is the third revolution in aviation  electrification
and it is happening right now
Like the previous piston and jet revolutions
going electric will dramatically transform the way we fly
Electrification promises to make flying accessible to more people globally
from more airports
while also making planes cleaner quieter and more affordable
The current dominant narrative is that we need to buy offsets
while waiting for some miracle future clean fuel
and meanwhile keep cramming people into tubes at increasingly congested hubs
That fails to reckon with the rapid progress
in electric technology
across nearly all other forms of transportation
So my answer in  was to create a company called Ampaire
and develop an electric aircraft capable of flying real routes for real airlines
And we have done so with this plane the Electric EEL
which first flew in 
In  our second generation of this plane
flew with an airline partner in Hawaii
demoing daily flight operations on one of their routes a world first
Meanwhile we're hard at work on the third generation of the EEL
as well as scaling up to a much larger passenger aircraft
with the help of NASA
Now these aren't yet fully electric planes
They're hybrids
And that's actually my point today
and why the current dominant narrative misses the mark
Electrification does not only mean pure battery electric
That's just not possible yet
when you need to carry passengers or cargo
except for small trainer aircraft
Instead our industry must start saving massive amounts of fuel and emissions
by electrifying the entire aviation ecosystem
Electrifying aviation right now
means solar panels and battery backup systems at airports
plugging planes into gate power instead of burning fuel
electric taxi to the runway
as well as electric tugs and ground equipment
For flight itself electrification means starting with small aircraft
and for planes of meaningful commercial size
payload and range starting hybrid
Although hybrid isn't the ultimate goal
it is critical to start right now
rather than waiting for future batteries or future fuels
Think of cars where we had a small Prius decades before a large Tesla semitruck
Small planes like Ampaires
are the proving grounds for electric technology
be it lighter high voltage cables
better compact motors or advanced power electronics
that are key to unlocking higher efficiency
in aircraft of all sizes
Electrification will permeate everything
from jumbo jets becoming more electric aircraft
to repowering island hopper prop planes
As batteries and electronics improve
larger and larger aircraft will get more and more electric over time
This is not a pipe dream
but represents iteration along a practical
cost effective and achievable route into the future
Ampaire is being joined by other companies
that are also striving to transform aviation to a cleaner future
It's a revolution in the making
building on technologies derived from electric ground transport
inventing new solutions and taking them higher and higher into the stratosphere
Thank you

Hi there my name is Daniel J Watts
I am a  Tony nominee
And I'm a storyteller
This is my new jam
Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh
Tapping sounds
Maaaaaan 
You don't really let paint dry
one of my mentors said to me one day
He meant it as a compliment
Yeah I guess you're right
I grinned back pseudoshyly
as I took said compliment and placed it on my head
like a halfcocked crown
I've always taken pride in being the kind of artist
that's always making moves
Tapping sounds
We were having one of our catchup sessions my mentor and I
July 
I between shooting episodes of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel
and moving into my new apartment uptown in Harlem
I'd just returned from Paris
I was just going out there to hang
You know 
shop a little take in a couple museums
sit down at cafs and watch the people go by
You know  trs parisien
Laissezfaire and whatnot
Little did I know that my vacation would turn into a workcation
and I would be asked to perform with my friend Ray
as he headlined at the international music festival AFROPUNK
OK I might have known a little bit
But I wasn't going to let that paint dry
Mm hmm
Tapping sounds
Upon my return Dave Chappelle was making his Broadway debut
followed by an inviteonly impromptu jam session
I had an invite
I jammed at the session
Ehhhh
That's all right
A week from then Tituss Burgess's album will be released
on which I had two features
and two days prior Deadline would announce
Broadway's 'Tina' Musical Finds its Ike Turner
in 'The Last OG' Costar Daniel J Watts
Ohhhh wet paint
And I had not yet started painting like this
The week before rehearsals
my mother and I would travel to Clarksdale Mississippi
Memphis Tennessee and Nutbush Tennessee
to see how a younger Ike Turner might have maneuvered through life
then back to NYC to finish shooting Maisel
then a quick trip to LA for an album release concert
then back to New York City to start Tina rehearsal
Four weeks of rehearsal
three weeks of tech
four more weeks of previews
And now it's November and it's opening night
My family which consists of my mother my two aunts
my two cousins and my yearold granny
fly up to support
They are drenched  drenched  in Southern pride
and basking in familial glory
as Tina Turner pretends to give me a light smacking around at the curtain call
in front of  people
Tapping sounds
It was awesome
Skip over to Thanksgiving which means it's basically Christmas
so you might as well say it's a new year
Happy New Year 
Spoiler alert things are going to get wild 
fast
But I wasn't about to let that  paint get dry
Yeahhhh
First off
performances of my oneman show overlap with my eight shows a week at 'Tina'
fully equipped with no days off
and a midnight performance on a Friday night
the night before a twoshow Saturday
Wet paint wet paint wet paint
Bleeding into February I'm starting to feel the effects
Everything's starting to blend
I'm only three months into my oneyear contract
and I'm already feeling like I need a break I need a vacation
Moving into March
and now taking on the role of Ike Turner has started to take its toll
and I can't tell whose trauma is whose
I can't tell whose trauma is hues 
And there's news of this mysterious illness making its Broadway debut
Uh but this paint though
All cylinders are firing I'm firing all cylinders
because there's Tony buzz  got to pack those interviews in 
which means suits purple suits blue suits green
Suits you it suits me
And is that a hazmat suit
Aquamarine
And as it seems the paint is beginning to dry
I ask myself
Do I really want all this
I mean all of this the fortune and the fame and the celebrity
Because Dave Chappelle said to David Letterman
that the more you invest into yourself as a celebrity
the less of yourself you get to own
Hmm
And I asked myself
Am I really going anywhere
Like what's my sense of direction
Because I feel like I'm not going anywhere
or like I'm running in place on a hamster wheel
that I don't know how to get off of
And it's like I have to ask permission
to do the thing that I know that I need to do for myself
and then and then and then and then 
The world finally stops
And because everything is in flux
I am forced to take a muchneeded reprieve
as that mysterious illness has been granted an extension
And though I know the answer is not for a while
I kept asking myself
Whens Broadway coming back
Because even though I really really really need to take this break
I really really really really really need a check
and I keep checking the status on this mysterious illness
because I need that paint to dry now
And now everyone's dazed and confused our greys turned to blues
I'm off all of the socials
but I stay glued to the news
because I'm watching the paint dry
that will not dry fast enough for me to keep going
Hmm
Skip to the summer
Skip to the summer
now the country's on fire
I'm back on all the socials
because my oneman show has been revived and revamped for the virtual space
so I can comment on the death of Ahmaud Breonna and George
Broadway still doesn't know when it's going to come back
but now it's in the hot seat for all of its past transgressions
And I think it might be time for me to take a break from the city
Three weeks in North Carolina two weeks in LA one week in Portland
I come back to New York
Broadway still doesn't know when it's going to come back
I need something to take my mind off all these pandemics
and the next thing I know 
I'm painting with my feet
I needed something live and in color
that wasn't Live and in color
And now I realize I'm obsessed with diving in colors
Watching them splatter swirl and blend
and do all the things people shouldn't be doing right now
And as I'm in the midst of my deep dive
I realize
I had to learn how to let paint dry
I have to stop
and take a break
because if I don't
my yellows and my blues will make green
even if that's not what I really really want
And then I started to think about all the other times
when I wasn't letting paint dry
when I wasn't taking time away to let things heal
like when I was still dancing on two sprained ankles
even though the doctor told me I needed to take a break for a while
Or when I was trying to force closure in a newly brokenup relationship
because I didn't want to deal with the healing process
Or when I fussed out my reps
because  because Netflix havent called to offer me a deal
a week after my oneman show
All the times when I didn't want time
to take the time it takes
to reveal itself to me
All the times when I didn't believe
that what I had already done was enough
and that I didn't have to keep going back in with more color
Broadway can't come back
It has to come forward
And when it does it has to be more expressive with the colors that it uses
And unfortunately I can't finish this piece for you right now
Because in order for me to do what I really want to be able to do
I have to let this paint dry
Ohhh and that's something that I'm 
I'm still really really really
learning to be OK with
But I know it'll be worth the wait
Thank you

As a small child I was lucky to be at the launch of Apollo 
the last manned mission to the Moon
and I've remained enamored with space ever since
And fortunate as a physician
to have contributed to NASA life sciences research
and to practice aerospace medicine
inspired by the crossdisciplinary teamwork required
to tackle audacious challenges
and how space is has often brought the world together
through the lens of seeing our planet as one without borders
Now just as the historic Apollo moon landings
were transformational inflection points in history
so too is the global health crisis of COVID
which despite its many challenges and tragedies
like the sinister Cold War setting which launched the space race
can have silver linings
As Regina Dugan former head of DARPA wrote
Sputnik set off the space age COVID can spark the health age
The silver linings include
the unprecedented acceleration
of innovation collaboration and discovery
catalyzing a future of health and medicine that can help us reimagine
and bring us a healthier smarter more equitable postCOVID world
Now many solutions ride the rails
of rapidly exponentially developing technologies
that are rapidly doubling in their speedprice performance
as exemplified by Moore's Law
which has enabled the billionfold improvements in memory and computation
resulting in the ubiquitous supercomputer smartphones
most of us carry in our pockets
I still have my now ancient iPhone  here
Still works which felt magical  years ago
but now feels slow and kludgy
And I'm sure my iPhone  will soon seem antique
perhaps as its features dissolve into the rumored to soon arrive
augmented reality smartglasses
Now exponential technologies packed into our smart devices
are becoming increasingly medicalized
with sensors able to detect an ear infection and more
So what used to fit on a desktop computer
now fits on our wrist
and these are now entering the domain of FDAapproved medical devices
But the future isn't about any one technology
but their convergence as they get faster cheaper better
In fact creating entire new fields at their interfaces
from computational biology robotic surgery
digiceuticals telemedicine to AIenabled radiology
And while many industries have been disrupted
and breached the fourth industrial age
health and medicine often feel stuck in the second or third
Critical data is still stuck being shared on fax machines paper forms
We're stuck in waiting rooms waiting for our visits
I recently had my own echocardiogram
only made available to share with me on a CDROM
I don't even own a CDROM player anymore
Tools for managing pandemics in 
rely on the same core technologies used in the pandemic of 
face masks social distancing
handwashing
So part of the challenge in advancing global local health
are our models our mindsets
We don't really practice health care We practice sick care
Sick care is based on intermittent episodic data
usually only obtained within the four walls of the clinic
or hospital bed
and leads to our reactive sick care model
where we wait for the patient to show up in the emergency room with a heart attack
stroke or latestage cancer
or for the pandemic to arrive on our shores
I believe the convergence of many of the accelerating technologies
and approaches being catalyzed by COVID
will bring us from intermittent sick care
to an age of continuous proactive personalized
crowdsourced health care
that can increasingly bring care anytime anywhere more effectively
and lower costs around the planet
For example the convergence of ever smaller interconnected devices
now riding G
is creating not just an Internet of Things
but an Internet of Medical Things
Much of this convergence is in the field of digital health
the ability to connect the dots between data sources
from personal genomics and medical records
with apps and services that match the needs
of an individual patient or caregiver
And as incentives and reimbursements align
COVID has pushed us to an increasingly virtualized care
from the hospital to home to our phone
to on and even inside our bodies
The age of hospital to homespital is upon us
Now the challenge of this hyperconnected age
is that we're creating exponential amounts of big data
that's too often siloed in formats that can't even talk to each other
So we need to narrow that gap between data
turning that into actual information for the patient physician
public health worker
and speed its safe and effective use in the community clinic and bedside
The pandemic has instigated an immense amount of international sharing
and collaboration amongst clinicians and researchers to narrow that gap
What was learned in managing patients in Wuhan
and then in the intensive care units of Italy
has helped New York City hospitals
and their learnings in turn have spread to centers around the world
Let's take a quick dive into some examples
of what's happening across the health care paradigm
in the age of COVID
and the implications for the future
From new forms of data to help prediction of prevention
to faster diagnostics more tailored therapy
and increasingly crowdsourced discovery
Let's start with prevention
Now while our genomes impact our health outcomes
and our health spans
our social determinants of health
our social and our daytoday behaviors drive most of our risk for disease
and associated costs
And we now have an explosion of new tools
to help measure and improve our healthy behaviors
The first Fitbit only launched in 
Wearables are now ubiquitous
and can measure almost every element of our physiology
behavior and even mental health
And they're evolving all the way from disposable tattoos
that can stream vital signs 
to an integration of big data that can 
Even small data from a simple wearable
tracking the patient discharged home after a hip replacement
or a coronavirus infection
can determine if the patient is recovering as expected
walking more doing great
or not so great and trigger early intervention
We're evolving from a world of quantified self
where our digital data remains silent on our devices
to one of quantified health
where the data can be shared securely with clinical teams
and researchers to help optimize prevention
diagnose disease early
and with feedback loops
personalize and optimize therapy
From wristband vitals
including blood pressure now obtainable without a cuff
and soon sensors that will measure our blood oxygenation levels
to continuous blood sugar monitoring
to shock'ables hearables ring'ables that can replace an entire sleep lab
fitting on our finger
to insideables chips beneath our skin to track our physiology and lab values
to even underwear'ables
Internet of Medical Things sensors so cheap today
you can get a pack of ten of them have one on each pair of your underwear
now being used to do what's called remote patient monitoring
to help detect signs of respiratory decompensation
of patients with bronchitis or COVID
Breath'ables are showing promise
Nanonoses that can detect molecules in our breath correlating to cancer
metabolic disease and even diagnosing infectious disease
In fact we now don't need to wear anything
Invisibles ambient sensing from AIenabled cameras
can track her vital signs
To voice as a biomarker to manage and detect mental health challenges
signs of heart disease
now being able to differentiate between a cough from a common cold
to that one caused by coronavirus
And we'll soon be exuding our digital exhaust 
our digitome
How do we make sense and truly leverage it
One path is through crowdsourcing
The millionparticipant All of Us trial
from the National Institutes of Health is doing just that
where data donors and I'm one can contribute our medical records
genomes and wearable data
to build a much better and diverse data set
crossing racial and socioeconomic groups
to help foster better precision medicine for all of us
Integrating this information for the individual and public health
will lead to predictalitics
our own personal check engine lights
that can give us early proactive warning
And recent work is demonstrating that wearables can detect presymptomatically
the onset of the flu
or as recently published by Stanford
in  percent of COVID patients
smartwatches can detect COVID infections early
often days before onset of symptoms
Selfreporting websites like Covid Near You
enable us to locally generate infections maps
and combined with our social graphs and contact tracing apps
may provide us detailed suggestions about who we might want to consider
being near or socially distanced from
What about advancements in diagnostics and monitoring
What used to require a full clinic or laboratory
can now fit into a digital doctor's bag
or the pocket of a patient
From COVID quarantine kits
enabling tracking of oxygen saturation temperature and lung sounds
we're starting to integrate these into virtual visits
providing realtime enhancements of a virtual physical exam
And the diagnostic tools are becoming increasingly infused
with AI machine learning
including consumer ultrasounds
which can bring diagnostics anywhere at very low cost
including the ability to evaluate the lungs
in suspected COVID patients
The laboratory has shrunk to microfluidic platforms
that can be attached to our smartphones
and enable anyone to take measurements from blood or saliva
Many of these diagnostics are leveraging the smartphone and its camera
for a medical selfie
For example instead of taking your urine to the lab
to diagnose a potential urinary tract infection
in the privacy of your home simply dip the urine dipstick
take a picture with your smartphone camera
and have the results made available immediately to your doctor and pharmacy
Similar phonebased apps and approaches are being used and developed
for fast frequent cheap and easy COVID testing
Novel approaches to community level diagnostics are also being explored
including next gen sequencing of sewage for early detection of COVID
identifying hotspots and predicted outbreaks a week or more early
The explosion of data sources however
is really beyond the capacity of the human mind
to effectively integrate
We're now getting help from AI
or as I call it IA intelligence augmentation
IA is being leveraged in reading CT scans to diagnose COVID
to enhancing the vision of a gastroenterologist
performing a colonoscopy
to identify lesions they might have missed
And AI is playing an active role in helping identify
and develop new antivirals
And while AI is often perceived as a threat by some clinicians
it can't replace the human touch or empathy
And I don't think doctors or nurses will be replaced by AI
but doctors and health care systems
whore collaborating with AI in the future will be replacing those who dont
Finally therapy
The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the use of virtual visits
Telemedicine visits are up on the order of a thousand percent in many settings
And I don't think we'll ever revert to preCOVID levels
as patients and clinicians are discovering the compelling convenience and efficacy
Even before virtual zoom or facetime with the clinician
asynchronous screening and support has been provided
by eversmarter chat bots that can help discern symptoms
and triage problems effectively at lower cost
This includes virtualization
and virtual augmentation to meet our mental health crisis
exacerbated by the many economic and other stressors
which accompany this pandemic
Dprinting is finding a role in health care
with newfound applications
from printing personal masks to critical parts of ventilators
and being leveraged by the growing maker movement
which is playing a major role in pandemic response
from making face shields and masks
to improvising doityourself ventilators
All together these efforts are enabling the potential
for democratization of health and medicine across the planet
and access to information and care that was previously inaccessible
Clinical trials are being reshaped leveraging smart devices
cloudbased analytic platforms and collaborators around the world
That's at this convergence of many rapidly developing
and exponential technologies
that we have the real potential to reshape
and scale health care at our pandemic age
One where we can dramatically expand access to basic health care
increasingly personalized and proactive
leveraging the scale of digital platforms and technologies
enhancing digital connection and empathy
and the ability to blend virtual and inperson care
and leveraging the power of the crowd to share and build better maps
that guide our individual health
and public health journeys
and to develop validated and scaled solutions
So imagine a new generation of volunteers
a global health corps
similar to the volunteer paramedics and firemen of today
that can be upskilled
use the powerful new tools to respond early
and collectively to enhance contact tracing isolation and quarantine
and to help identify and address social and other disparities
So coming full circle
Twenty four years after I was at the launch of Apollo 
I found myself as a medical student on a research clerkship
at Johnson Space Center
And much to my surprise one day in the clinic
I ran right into Gene Cernan
the Apollo  commander and the last man to walk on the Moon
After enthusiastically sharing my childhood memories of his launch
he shared one of his famous lines
I walked on the Moon What can't you do
Indeed what can't we do if we work together as one
in the face of this pandemic
And just as the near tragedy of Apollo 
rallied NASA to work creatively and collectively
so too can this in our pandemic age lead to our finest hour
bring on a true health age
I believe this is possible if we all get out of our linear mindsets
take exponential steps and collaboratively go forth collectively
not only to solve the challenges of this pandemic
and predict the future of health and medicine
but boldly to go forth together
to accelerate a far better one for everyone on Spaceship Earth
Thanks

Tennessee Williams once told us
There comes a time when you look into the mirror
and you realize that what you see is all you'll ever be
and then you accept it or you kill yourself
Laughter
or you stop looking in mirrors
Laughter
And speaking of mirrors someone else once said
If we spend too much time scrutinizing what's in our rearview mirror
we're certain to crash into a light post''
I've spent the last four years of my life studying people who look in mirrors
rearview and otherwise in their search for selfawareness
I wanted to know what selfawareness really is
where it comes from
why we need it
and how to get more of it
My research team surveyed quantitatively thousands of people
We analyzed nearly  scientific studies
And we conducted dozens of indepth interviews
with people who made dramatic improvements in their selfawareness
Now initially
we were actually so worried that we wouldn't find any of these people
that we called them selfawareness unicorns
Laughter
True
But thank goodness we did find them
Because what these unicorns taught me
would create a groundbreaking revelation
for how all of us can find genuine selfawareness
And that's what I want to share with you
Today I want you to reflect on how you're reflecting
I know that's a mouthful
And to get there we're going to need to shatter
one of the most widely held beliefs about finding selfawareness
But first things first
What is this thing we call selfawareness anyway
It's the ability to see ourselves clearly
to understand who we are how others see us
and how we fit into the world
Selfawareness gives us power
We might not always like what we see
but there's a comfort in knowing ourselves
And there's actually a ton of research
showing that people who are selfaware are more fulfilled
They have stronger relationships
They're more creative
They're more confident and better communicators
They are less likely to lie cheat and steal
They perform better at work and are more promotable
And they're more effective leaders with more profitable companies
In the world of selfawareness there are two types of people
those who think they're selfaware
Laughter
and those who actually are
It's true
My team has found that  of people think they're selfaware
Laughter
but the real number is closer to  to 
You know what this means don't you
Laughter
It means that on a good day  on a good day 
 of us are lying to ourselves
Laughter
about whether we're lying to ourselves
Laughter
Pretty scary right
So you can imagine the challenge we had in figuring out who was truly selfaware
What do you think would've happened if I had said
Hey How selfaware are you
Exactly
So to be part of our research our unicorns had to clear four hurdles
They had to believe they were selfaware
as measured by an assessment my team developed and validated
Using that same assessment someone who knew them well had to agree
They had to believe
that they'd increased their selfawareness in their life
and the person rating them had to agree
We found  people
out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds who met our criteria
They were professionals entrepreneurs artists students stayathome parents
And we didn't find any patterns by industry age gender
or any other demographic characteristic
These unicorns helped my team discover a most surprising truth
That approach you're using to examine
your thoughts your feelings and your motives
you know introspection
Well you're probably doing it 
there's no easy way to say this 
you're probably doing it totally wrong
Yes there is a reason so few of us are selfaware
So let me tell you about the evening
that I first discovered the ugly truth about introspection
It was about  pm on a beautiful Colorado spring evening
And I was in my office
hopped up on Diet Coke and Smartfood popcorn
Laughter
And I just analyzed a set of data
and to say that I was surprised would be an understatement
My team and I had just run a simple study
looking at the relationship between introspection
and things like happiness stress and job satisfaction
Naturally the people who introspected would be better off
Wouldn't you think so
Our data told the exact opposite story
People who introspected were more stressed and depressed
less satisfied with their jobs and their relationships
less in control of their lives
I had no idea what was going on
And it got worse
These negative consequences increased the more they introspected
Laughter
So I was quite confused
Later that week I ended up coming across a yearold study
that looked at how widowers adjusted to life without their partners
The researchers found
that those who try to understand the meaning of their loss
were happier less depressed one month later
but one year later were more depressed
They were fixated on what happened instead of moving forward
Have you been there
I have
Selfanalysis can trap us in a mental hell of our own making
So things were starting to make sense
Now you Die Hard selfawareness fans
and particularly introspection fans in the audience might be thinking
Sure introspection may be depressing
but it's worth it
because of the insight it produces
And you're right
I'm not here today to tell you
that the pursuit of selfawareness is a waste of time
Not at all
I am here to tell you that the way you're pursuing it doesn't work
Here is the surprising reality
Thinking about ourselves isn't related to knowing ourselves
So to understand this
let's look at the most common introspective question
Why
We might be searching for the cause of a bad mood
Why am I so upset after that fight with my friend
Or we might be questioning our beliefs
Why don't I believe in the death penalty
Or we might be trying to understand a negative outcome
Why did I choke in that meeting
Unfortunately when we ask Why
it doesn't lead us towards the truth about ourselves
It leads us away from it
There are so many reasons this is the case
Today I'll give you two
Here is the first reason we shouldn't ask why
Researchers have found
that no matter how hard we try
we can't excavate our unconscious thoughts feelings and motives
And because so much is hidden from our conscious awareness
we end up inventing answers that feel true but are often very wrong
Let me give you an example
Psychologists Timothy Wilson and Richard Nisbett set up a card table
outside their local Meijers thrifty store in Ann Arbor Michigan
And on that card table they laid out four identical pairs of pantyhose
And they asked the people walking by to pick their favorite
Laughter
Now consumer research shows that people tend to prefer products on the right
And that's exactly what happened
Even though every pair was identical
people chose pair D at a rate of four to one
And when asked why they have chosen the pair they had
they confidently declared that pair D was just better
Laughter
And even  get this 
even when the researchers told them about the effect of positioning
they refused to believe it
The second reason asking Why is a bad idea
is that it leads us away from our true nature
We like to think of our brains as supercomputers
rationally analyzing information and arriving at accurate conclusions
Unfortunately that's not what happens
Let's do a quick exercise that's based on another classic psychology study
So if I were to ask you to make a list
of all the reasons your romantic relationship was going the way it was
what would you say
Let's say that in general your relationship is pretty awesome
But let's just pretend that yesterday
you happened to get in a huge fight
about the proper way to load the dishwasher
Laughter
Really bad
Now because of something called the recency effect
this is going to carry an unfair amount of weight
You might start thinking of things like I am so sick of his mansplaining
Laughter
Or you might think
Why the hell does it matter so much how I load the dishwasher
And before you know it
you're thinking your relationship isn't going so well
Laughter
Asking Why created alternative facts
Laughter
And over time this leads us away from who we really are
It clouds our selfperceptions
So you might be wondering
if asking Why makes us depressed overconfident and wrong
it's probably not going to increase our selfawareness
But don't worry
I'm not here today to tell you to stop thinking about yourselves
I am here to tell you to start doing it just a little bit differently
So if we shouldn't ask Why then what should we ask
Do you remember our selfawareness unicorns
When we looked at how they approached introspection we found the answer
We analyzed literally hundreds of pages of transcripts
and we saw a very clear pattern
Although the word why appeared less than  times
the word what appeared more than  times
Let me give you a few examples
Nathan a brand manager
got a terrible performance review from his new boss
Instead of asking Why are we like oil and water
he asked
What can I do to show her I'm the best person for this job
It changed everything
People now point to Nathan and his boss
as proof that polar opposites can work together
Sarah an education leader was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late s
And when she asked Why me
she said it felt like a death sentence
So then she asked
What's most important to me
This helped her define
what she wanted her life to look like in whatever time she had left
She's now cancer free
and more focused on the relationships that mean the most to her
Jose an entertainment industry veteran hated his job
And instead of getting stuck what most of us would do
and ask Why do I feel so terrible
he asked What are the situations that make me feel terrible
and what do they have in common
He quickly realized that he would never be happy in this job
and it gave him the courage
to pursue a new and far more fulfilling career path as a wealth manager
So these are just three examples
of dozens of unicorns that asked What instead of Why
Do I have any Nathans or Sarahs or Joses in the room
I'll add one more Tasha
So earlier this year I published a book about all of this
which I am so proud of
But one day for some unknown reason
I did what every author is never supposed to do
I read my Amazon reviews
Laughter
And you guys it was devastating
I asked Why are people being so mean to me
about a book that I spent thousands of hours researching
and wrote to make their lives better
Right
I fell into a spiral of selfloathing
It was honestly one of the low points of my life
A couple of weeks went by
and it dawned on me
that maybe I should take my own advice
Laughter
So I tried a different question
I asked What about all those people
who were telling me that my book has helped them change their lives
What a different outcome
So no I wasn't doing it right either
This is not an easy world is it
Not at all
Laughter
She knows we all know
But I have seen so much evidence
that selfawareness gives us a much better shot
at finding happiness and success in this crazy world
To start we just need to change one simple word
Change why to what
Whyquestions trap us in that rearview mirror
Whatquestions move us forward to our future
As human beings we are blessed with the ability to understand who we are
what we want to contribute and the kind of life we want to lead
Remember our selfawareness unicorns had nothing in common
except a belief in the importance of selfawareness
and a daily commitment to developing it
That means we can all be unicorns
The search for selfawareness never ever stops
Life goes on
It's up to us to choose to learn and grow
from our mistakes and our tragedies and our successes
One of the best quotes I've ever heard on this subject is from Rumi
He said Yesterday I was clever so I wanted to change the world
Today I'm wise so I am changing myself
Thank you very much
Applause

According to legend  when this planet was young and molten
three galactic terraformers shaped it into a paradise
When their work was done  they sought out new worlds
but left the source of their power behind
three powerful golden hexagons
hidden within dungeons  full of traps and monsters
If one person were to bring all three hexagons together
they could reinvent the world however they saw fit
That was thousands of years ago
Today youve learned of Gordon an evil  wizard dead set on collecting the hexagons
and enslaving the world to his will
So you set off on a quest  to get them first
adventuring through fire ice and sand
Yet each time you find that someone else  got there first
Not Gordon but a merchant named Dongle
At the end of the third dungeon you find a note inviting you to Dongles castle
You show up with a wallet bursting  with the  gems
youve collected in your travels
arriving just moments before Gordon  who also has  gems
Dongle has not only collected  the golden hexagons
but hes used them to create   silver hexagons
just as powerful  as their golden counterparts
Why did Dongle do all this
Because theres one thing he loves above all else auctions
You and the evil wizard will compete to win the hexagons
starting with the three golden ones
making one bid for each item  as it comes up
The winners of ties will alternate  starting with you
Whoever first collects a trio  of either golden or silver hexagons
can use their power to recreate the world
Youve already bid  gems on the first
when you realize that your rival has a dastardly advantage
a mirror that lets him see what youre bidding
He bids zero  and you win the first hexagon outright
Whats your strategy to win a matching trio of hexagons before your rival
Pause here to figure it out for yourself
Answer in 
Answer in 
Answer in 
Dongles dangled a difficult dilemma
Do you spend big to try to win  the golden hexagons outright
Save as much as possible for silver Or something inbetween
Gordon can use his magic mirror  and  gems
to make sure that no matter what you bid  on the second gold
he can bid one more and block you
So the real question is how can you force Gordon to spend enough on the golds
to guarantee that youll win on the silvers
Heres a hint
Lets say at the start  of the silver auctions
you had a one gem advantage  such as  to 
You need to win three auctions
so could you divide your gems  into three groups of three and win
For simplicity lets assume  a set of rules thats worse for you
where Gordon wins every tie
If you bid  each time  the best he could do
is win two silver hexagons  and have two gems left
which youll beat with three bids of 
Any onegem advantage where your starting total is divisible by three
will lead to victory by the same logic
So knowing that how can you force Gordon's hand in the gold auctions
so you go into silver with an advantage
Lets first imagine that Gordon lets  you win the second gold auction
by betting some amount X with a tie
You could then bid everything you have left on the third gold hexagon
and he'd have to match you to block
So if you could bid  on the third gold
you'd go into silver with a  to  advantage which you know you can win
Solving for X reveals that in order to have  on round three
you should bid at most  on round two
But what about the other possibility
where Gordon wins the second gold  against your bid of 
would this strategy still work
The least he could bid to win the second gold is 
making the total  to Gordons 
No one would then bid on round three
since youve each blocked the other  from getting three golds
After that you could bid   every time to win three silvers
The bidding war was close
but your ingenuity kept you one link ahead in the chain of inference
and the silver trisource is yours
Now what will you do with it

The Trojan War has been raging  for  years
with neither Greeks nor Trojans  prevailing
Gods and humans alike are desperate for a break
so when a divine omen races across the sky
the two sides agree to a  day truce
From high up on Olympus youve been  waiting for an opportunity
to bring this bloody war  to its conclusion
When you go to consult the Fates they advise
should the peace last for a full  days all will end soon
However if the truce is broken
the ensuing battle will lead to  more devastating years of war
The Fates loom has shown them  the exact conditions
that will keep the truce intact
The great Trojan plain can be viewed  as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments
If theyre organized in such a way that  any Greek can reach any other Greek camp
without having to pass through a Trojan  camp and likewise for Trojans
peace will prevail
Anyone can move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent camp
but never diagonally
The problem is theyre currently arranged like this
Tonight you can use your powers to swap up to six pairs of camps
that are horizontally vertically or diagonally adjacent
No camp can be moved more than once
Which swaps do you make to keep the peace
Pause here to figure it out yourself Answer in 
Answer in 
Answer in 
The first insight here is to divide this into two subproblems
Theres the matter of connecting   clumps of Greeks
without putting holes in the Trojan line
And then theres dealing  with the thorny center space
Lets consider the Greeks first
To connect any Greek clumps
youll have to mess  with the nice straight Trojan lines
If you try to do that anywhere in the center of these arms
you'll create new isolated clusters of Trojans
So the only option is to go  to the perimeter of the field
and move some Trojans diagonally say here here and here
Now for the center
theres no way to connect the Trojan arms  without swapping a Trojan in
But continuing to shift that arm  of Trojans inward
would require moving  the same Greek camp multiple times
However you could shift the whole Trojan arm up and to the right
closing this gap
There are several solutions with slight variants
but as long as you perform this maneuver on the short arm of Trojans
you can achieve peace in exactly  moves
You make the swaps and all is well  until the fifth night
One of your rival gods wants to see the bloodshed continue
and has taken advantage  of a forgotten prophecy
Hes convinced one Trojan camp  to make a swap
with their horizontal vertical  or diagonal Greek neighbors
that will break up the Greek connectivity
Once again you consult the Fates who prophesize the following
the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere within four grid spaces
of the perimeter of the battlefield
They wont go through with a swap  if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity
And finally you can make  at most two swaps
with the same rules as before  to thwart them
Which swaps do you make  to block the troublesome Trojan camp
Answer in 
Answer in 
Answer in 
You won't be able to identify the scheming camp precisely
but theres a lot you can do  to at least narrow down the options
They have to be somewhere in this area
And they have to be able to block Greek camps from each other in a single swap
That doesnt leave many options
the only possible blockages  are at the end of these two arms
where a Trojan camp could plug a hole without opening a new one
So they must be in one of these  four camps
Lets look at the right arm first
Theres a threat here because this column  has two Trojan camps
If one moves to the right  the other will still be in place
blocking Greeks from crossing
so we can thwart them by moving either one a column left into this square
and the same principle applies  to the bottom arm
Your effort maintains the peace  for the final  days
But it seems that a certain Greek general noticed what was happening
and left the Trojans a parting gift

Baking apple pie Discount orange warehouse has you covered
A fruits a fruit right
Its  and scientist James Hansen  has just testified
to the United States Congress  that global warming trends
are caused by human activity
and will pose an increasing threat  to humanity in the future
Well well  Thats unusually prescient for a human
Looking for a wedding dress Try a new take on a timeless classic
Its sleek flattering and modest  just like the traditional dress
Commercials Could anything be more insufferable
Its  and the United States Senate  has called a hearing about global warming
Some expert witnesses point out that  past periods in Earths history
were warmer than the th century
Because such variations existed long before humans
the witnesses claim the current warming trend
is also the result of natural variation
Ah there is something more insufferable than a commercial
Luckily for the humans  theres one more expert witness
What are you looking at  Were all dressed
At least we are by the logic  you just used
Its as if you were to say  apples and oranges are both fruits
therefore they taste the same
Or that underwear wedding dresses  and suits are all clothes
therefore theyre all equally appropriate attire for a Senate hearing
The European wars of the th century  and World War I were all wars right
So World War I couldnt be any more devastating than those other wars
could it
Lets say two people have a fever
They must have the same disease  thats causing that fever right
Of course not  One fever could be caused by chicken pox
the other by influenza  or any number of other infections
Like your claim about rising global temperatures
these claims make a false analogy
You're assuming that because two phenomena share a characteristic
in this case warming  they are analogous in other ways
like the cause of that warming
But theres no evidence  that thats the case
Yes there have been other warm periods  in Earths history
no ones disputing that the climate  fluctuates
But let's take a closer look at some of those older examples of global warming
shall we
The Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse  million years ago
was so warm  forests covered Antarctica
Volcanic activity was likely responsible for boosting atmospheric carbon dioxide
and creating a greenhouse effect
The PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum   million years ago
was so warm crocodiles swam the waters of the Arctic Circle
This warming may have been caused by the drying of inland seas
and release of methane  a potent greenhouse gas
from ocean sediments
Even among these other warm periods youre making a false analogy
Yes they had natural causes
But each had a different cause
and involved a different amount  and duration of warming
Theyre as dissimilar as they are similar
Taking them together  all we can reasonably conclude
is that the Earths climate  seems to change
in response to conditions on the planet
Today human activity is a dominant force shaping conditions on your planet
so the possibility that its driving global warming
cant be dismissed out of hand
Ill grant that the more complicated  something is
the easier it is to make a mistaken analogy
Thats especially true because there are many different types of false analogy
that similar symptoms must share a cause
that similar actions must lead to similar consequences and countless others
Most false analogies youll come  across are far less obvious
than those comparing apples to oranges  and climate is notoriously complex
It requires careful rigorous study and evidence collection
and making a false analogy like this only impedes that process
Its  and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
has found  aggregating decades of research
that there is more than a  chance  the global warming trend
since the midth century  has been driven by human activity
namely the burning of fossil fuels

Socrates one of the founding fathers of Western philosophical thought
was on trial
Many Athenians believed  he was a dangerous enemy of the state
accusing the philosopher of corrupting the youth
and refusing to recognize their gods
However Socrates wasnt feared  for claiming to have all the answers
but rather for asking too many questions
While he loathed formal lectures
the philosopher frequently engaged friends and strangers
in lengthy conversations about morality and society
These discussions werent debates nor would Socrates offer explicit advice
In fact the philosopher often claimed to know nothing at all
responding to his partner's answers only with further questions
But through this process  Socrates probed their logic
revealing its flaws and helping both parties reach a more robust understanding
These insightful questions made Socrates beloved by his followers
Two of his students Plato and Xenophon were so inspired
that they replicated their mentors  process in fictional dialogues
These invented exchanges provide perfect examples
of what would come to be known  as the Socratic Method
In one of these fabricated dialogues
Socrates is conversing with  a young man named Euthydemus
who is confident that he understands  the nature of justice and injustice
Socrates probes the students values by asking him to label actions
such as lying and theft  as just or unjust
Euthydemus confidently categorizes them as injustices
but this only prompts another question
is it just for a general to deceive or pillage a hostile army
Euthydemus revises his assertion
He claims that these actions  are just when done to enemies
and unjust when done to friends
But Socrates isnt finished
He asks the young man to consider  a commander lying to his troops
to boost their morale
Before long Euthydemus is despondent
It seems that every answer leads to further problems
and perhaps hes not quite sure what constitutes justice after all
In employing this questionoriented approach
Socrates described himself as a midwife
whose inquiries assist others in giving birth to their ideas
His method of questioning draws out an individuals unexamined assumptions
and then challenges those biases
It doesn't always provide definitive answers
but the method helps clarify the questions
and eliminate contradictory  or circular logic
And by following a line of inquiry  where it logically leads
both the question asker and answerer can end up in unexpected places
This technique isnt limited  by the conversations content
making it incredibly useful in numerous fields
During the Renaissance the method was used to teach clinical medicine
Students proposed their rationale for different diagnoses
while a doctor questioned their assumptions and moderated discussion
In this model the method could even produce conclusive results
This same approach was later used in other sciences
such as astronomy botany  and mathematics
Following the Protestant Reformation
it was adapted to tackle abstract questions of faith
In the th century the method  became an essential part
of American legal education
Professors explored students  understanding of judicial reasoning
by challenging them with unforeseen hypothetical situations
This approach is still used today by the Supreme Court
to imagine the unintended impacts  of passing a law
The Socratic Method can be adapted  to teach almost any topic
that relies on critical reasoning
but its success depends on the teacher  employing it
An effective Socratic educator  must be well versed in their subject
Rather than bullying their students or showing off their superior intellect
they should be modest genuinely curious  and affirming of every contribution
In this regard Socrates himself
may not have been  the most subtle Socratic teacher
Historians believe he was deeply critical of Athens particular brand of democracy
and known to pass those concerns onto his followers
These subversive beliefs were distorted in public forums
and thought to have inspired  two of his pupils to treasonous ends
It was likely for these ideas Socrates was brought to trial
and eventually  sentenced to death
But even on his deathbed artists depict a serene philosopher
ever curious to explore  the ultimate question

Helen Walters Hi Esther Perel thank you so much for joining us
and I want to get right to it
So we're more than a year into this pandemic now
And I think one constant
whether we're really acknowledging it or not
has been heightened stress levels shall we say
So I'm sure you've seen this in your practice and in your work
And I'm curious what are you recommending to people
who are coming to you wanting to know how to regulate stress effectively
Esther Perel So hello Helen here it is
You know we're living in a time of existential anguish of isolation
of universal grief economic insecurity prolonged uncertainty
And we have a tendency to call all this feelings stress
But stress is multidimensional
Researchers Susan David and Elissa Epel
emphasize the importance of having to break it down into parts
so that they become manageable
We have despair
We have anxiety exhaustion sadness anger irritability
All these feelings are part of stress
And when they are named and framed
we can better regulate them and deal with them
Prolonged uncertainty at this moment is that notion that we are uncertain
but we also don't know how long this will last
This is not your typical disaster
where you have a warning and a planning
and an onslaught and a post
We are in it and we don't know for how long
We experience a sense of ambiguous loss where things are gone but still there
and it really prevents a sense of mourning
Buildings are standing
They are physically present the office buildings
but they are emotionally hollow
Family members are in nursing homes or in other countries
They are emotionally psychologically very very close to us
but they are physically absent
And that sense of ambiguous loss is most exemplified
in what we are experiencing at this moment
as the loss of Eros
And the pandemic gripped the world
And then the pendulum that swings between freedom and security
has snapped off its hinge
There is a constant extreme emphasis on safety
and it cordons off
We avoid the spaces where we can experience happenstance
chance encounters mystery surprise
all those elements of Eros that create a sense of aliveness
and vibrancy in our lives
That is the place where creativity and curiosity also meet
So what are some of the things that people can do
once we understand stress in this way
is to create routines and rituals and boundaries
Routines to separate the different activities
the different roles and responsibilities that we inhabit
rituals because they create sacred time and sacred space
and boundaries because they create delineation demarcation borders
and those are really necessary for us
to experience a sense of groundedness and structure
And the second thing that really helps with stress as well
is actually to create space for Eros
There's a reason people at this moment are seeing plants grow seeing bread rise
creating things making things out of nothing
Because when you see life emerge in front of you
or something change in front of you
it functions as an antidote to deadness and to stress
HW It's true I can't tell you how many of my friends have adopted puppies
in this time
Everyone's a dog owner
EP You know we usually thrive
on this casual sharing of personal stories with coworkers
or going to a place for lunch
that we hadn't gone to and wanted to explore
or talking to a kind stranger on the commute
All of these enlivening moments of our lives
surprise moments of our lives are currently not there
So the puppy it really gives us all of that you know a pet amongst us
So not just any pet you know an animal a child
Those are natural sources of surprise and mystery and spontaneity
They bring the Eros right in front of us
HW I love that because I think it's such a good analysis of where we are
and what we've all been experiencing
I think the flip side of this almost is
there's basically no such thing as control
Right And so I'm curious you know
for those of us who used to have a life
that we understood in some ways 
so we had the office we had the home we had these places where we could go
and we kind of understood how the world was structured 
with the collapse of those roles and the collapse of those boundaries
how do you regain a sense of yourself in this new world
and what are your tips for kind of establishing the boundaries
like these new boundaries
EP We are not working from home
we are working with home
and we are sometimes sitting on one chair
I was doing a session for How's Work
with a newsroom
and one of the people was talking about how she has a new baby
She sits at home she's nursing
She's the mother She's the colleague
She's the manager She's the reporter
She's the spouse She's the daughter of
She's the friend
She has all those roles coming together
merged in one place
ever without having to leave her dining room table
And the mute button is basically her only boundary left
between one world and the other
So what has she lost
She lost the sense of community
of collective support that she gets at work
the ability to commiserate
She lost being a woman who is a mother who goes to work and is a working mother
because now she's actually working and mothering at the same time
the whole day in the same place
That's a very different experience
And for her and every working parent at this moment
it is essential to communicate boundaries with partners
We were talking yesterday  and with colleagues as well
We were talking yesterday
Your child came into the room and basically you notified
I am home I am alone my son is here and he may show up
And indeed he did
And there is something very different
when we don't try to hide our multiple realities
but we actually integrate them
in the midst of the situations that we are in
Carving out a special sacred space
physical space to delineate the separations
I think at this point is extremely important
That involves you know even changing clothes
We are usually very localized people
and we change we move to another place
We have a ritual of preparing the things that we need to put in our bag
to go to the gym to go to the restaurant to go to see friends or family
None of these markers are currently there
to give us that embodied sense of experience
We are exhausted basically
We use the word a lot
but we don't always attribute exactly where that exhaustion is coming from
and it comes from the loss of these delineations and demarcations
these boundaries that are very very grounding to us
HW I don't know if you saw that video of the dad who was on telly with the BBC
and his kid came in and then another kid came in
He kind of strongarmed the kid out of the way
And I think what's beautiful about this is that we have you know
I think that we are all learning how to roll with this
And you know now my son will come and join a meeting
and everyone's just like waves and is like Hi Jack
and you know and then he gets bored and wanders off again
And that's kind of you know in a way I think that's a really beautiful outcome
I mean it's a very lucky outcome
because I'm very lucky to be able to work at home
and have that kind of fortunate aspect of my life
But I just think it's a beautiful outcome
EP But you know what's also very striking
is that you're not trying to hide it
and to whisk him away
In a way I think you know we are integrating your home life
your reality as a mother alone at home with your child
who is also working as part of our conversation
And I think that this for me reflects a very interesting change in this moment
which is a kind of an antismall talk
You know people are literally speaking about the things
that they usually try to keep outside of the office door
We usually bring our whole self to work
Right now we are bringing our whole work to our personal world
and that merging is creating
a very different set of conversations as well
And those conversations are part of the collective resilience
that helps us deal with the loss of control
the prolonged uncertainty
and all the other stressors that we mentioned
HW So how does this affect our ability to feel productive
I'm curious about that feeling of like 
at the end of the day I just did a really 
I nailed that project so I did that really well
And I feel really good about that
I'm going to close the door and I'm going to leave and I'm going to go home again
EP I'm going to frame this a little differently
Zygmunt Bauman the sociologist
basically made this very very apt observation
In abnormal circumstances
when people have abnormal responses
that is actually normal
So this notion of wanting to continue to be how we used to be
is one of the things that we need to release
We  this is a time where we try to face our uncertainty
by being even more productive
And so we end up working seven days
instead of understanding that what really will help us get through this
is a sense of mass mutual reliance
a deep sense of interdependence that we are in a shared experience
and that collectively we need to go through this
That in itself will help us remain productive
but not the amount of hours that we are putting in
or the notion that we have an outcome that is as good
as it would have been if none of this was happening
because it is happening
We can't pretend that none of this is happening
And I think that when we are able to acknowledge our reality
and then respond accordingly
it actually A  makes us more productive
B  makes us less stressful
and C  maintains our sense of connection
which ultimately is our greatest source of resilience
for dealing with this kind of situation
HW What are you hearing from managers about how they're dealing with this
in terms of their people and their organizations
and how are you helping them
EP So what I hear from managers
are the same stresses that we've just mentioned
is a new emphasis on not just on relationships
and the importance of relational intelligence in the workplace
but of mental health and wellness
of an integration of an entire emotional vocabulary
that involves empathy and trust and psychological safety
at the same time as we are discussing performance indicators
What I bring to the conversation is really how do you create
these antismall talk exchanges conversations with a team
and every team has a different culture for that
But it is about helping people
inviting people to talk about how the big events
that are happening at this point in the world
are also manifesting in their personal lives
And I give them the example of my own startup of EPGM
where we on Friday have literally shrunken the length of the meeting
and have taken a much longer time
to check in with each other
about selfcare
about the divisions that take place in our own families
about what have been the resources that have been most useful
But it has become really a resource pool that has deepened the connections
and that has also fostered the resilience
and has had very clear effects on the productivity
So I shared that with the companies that I work with and talk about stress
and boundaries and communications
so that it helps people understand what they are going through
but particularly that this is a shared collective experience
they're going through
and not just something that is happening to them alone
Acute stress or pandemics fracture
and create divisions
because uncertainty leads people
to want to confront the loss of their sense of mastery and certainty
And so it often invites a kind of polarization
about the worldview itself
To create a shared vocabulary counters all of that
And that is primarily what I do at this moment
when I work with companies
or cofounders or managers
is to  what you were saying before
it's to name it to frame it to distill it
and then to be creative in how to respond to it
HW I'm curious for your thoughts about what does this mean for the future of work
and how we should prepare for it
EP Look there's a lot of discussions about the future of work
that centers on the remote versus inperson
and all of those things
I think for me what this pandemic has really taught us
is that relational intelligence is not just a soft skill for the workplace
that mental health is really at the center at this moment
of how we show up at work
Work is a place today where we seek belonging purpose development
and way beyond just putting food on the table
It is an identity economy
And those fundamental existential needs that people are bringing in
psychological needs that people are bringing to work
are part of how we are going to redefine the future of the workplace
There are tendencies to talk about it in relation to technology to AI
and all those things are really important
But because of the technology
because of the AI because of all the loss of the human touch
the conversation about how we maintain humanity
how we maintain social connection
how we allow people to show up 
You know people always say I want to bring my whole self to work
And I say we already do
All the skills that we cultivate in our lives
and in our childhood growing up
they show up with us at work
and this moment has really made that beyond clear
HW Esther Perel it's always a pleasure to talk to you
Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us
EP It's a pleasure for me to be here
Thank you

Society has a set of stories it tells itself
about who refugees are and what they look like
But let me tell you a different story
My story
I'm a filmmaker and a refugee
from a small village in northern Syria
In our village growing up there was no stable electricity supply
We spend most of our nights around gas lanterns
and told stories about Syrian mythological superbeings
that protected the vulnerable
I was a boy who loved the stories of superheroes
But later on these stories shifted to tales of heroes
that my family has to face under the Assad dictatorship
One of my uncles was killed under torture
My father had to burn his books before they were even published
in order to protect us from the regime
He burned his dreams along with his books
These stories must not be forgotten
my parents insisted
The stories stopped being a pastime
It became a form of resistance
I studied filmmaking and focused on documentaries
Documentary filmmaking you see became my way of resistance
I documented stories of Syrians who opposed the Assad regime
in  when the revolution started
I was arrested tortured
and sexually assaulted
When I was released I left Syria
I was traumatized
and tried to end my life
My wife stood by me and helped me hang onto life
But as a result I stopped making films
Despite my arrest and torture
I took many risks in order to see my family
So a year later when the Assad regime lost control of the north of Syria
I was able to visit my hometown
There I met many inspiring Syrians
real life superheroes who stayed behind to save lives
I was captivated by how genuine they were
Without planning I took out my camera and started filming
I felt inspired
These reallife superheroes saved the filmmaker in me
Khalid was one of the heroes in my first feature film
Last Men in Aleppo
Khaled was a simple man who dreamed to be a firefighter
but he couldn't follow his dream
So he worked as a house painter
When the war destroyed his city he found his calling
He joined the White Helmets
a group of Syrian volunteers who formed a civil defense organization
to rescue civilians from their bombed homes
Khalid saved hundreds of lives
While doing that he died as a hero
The second hero is Dr Amani Ballour
whose story I told in my second film The Cave
It's a story of an extraordinary woman
who founded an underground hospital in eastern Ghouta
She treated injured children victims of atrocities
while bombs fell around them
As a female scientist
she defied sexism and patriarchy
to save civilians who suffered two attacks with chemical weapons
And then there are the two superheroes who saved my own life
Khalil Ma'touq and Anwar alBunni
They are the lawyers who took up my case
and got me out of the most notorious torture facilities in Damascus
While Anwar now is in Germany fighting for justice for Syrian refugees
Khalil was arrested in  because of his work
We don't know anything about him
because the Syrian regime continues to deny his arrest
but his work is not in vain
It's for Khalil I faced my torturer in Germany
In June  I gave my testimony
at the first trial on Syrian state of torture
before a German court in Koblenz
It is for Amani and Khalid
I'm still the filmmaker today
They inspired me to create a new cinematic universe of superheroes
based on their quest to end injustice
Creating this cinematic universe has not been an easy journey
It's been a brutal struggle
against racism and discrimination in the film industry
an industry dominated by people who think they know how the audience
how you want a film about Syrians to be
how you want superheroes or refugees to look
But refugees look just like me
These refugees were superheroes
who defied the status quo and stereotype
So I will not stop I owe it to them
I owe it to my daughter the young refugee child
To tell the stories of superheros
who look just like her
For her I will continue to resist
Thank you

Its a bustling day in Pompeii
Fabia visits the Temple of Venus and offers a sacrificial dove to the goddess
asking her to bless her brothers upcoming wedding
After a quick visit to the market
she spots her brothers Lucius and Marcus crossing the Forum
Theyre off to relax at the public baths
Marus spent the morning helping a master  craftsman lay a grand mosaic floor
while Lucius worked in the brickyard
Its been  years since an earthquake hit Pompeii and its neighbor Herculaneum
and theres still construction and repair work to do
Fabia and her brothers discuss the recent  tremors everyones been feeling
Lucius jokes that therell always be work  for men who rebuild walls in Pompeii
He tells them how eager he is to bind hands with his sponsa or bridetobe
The siblings begin discussing  tomorrows wedding
but a deafening boom interrupts them
They watch Vesuvius spew smoke ash  and rock high into the air
and realize they've been living in the shadow of a volcano
They embrace and pray to Venus  for protection and Vulcan for mercy
Each must now choose how to survive
They have three options  seek shelter escape to the south on foot
or flee to the west by sea
Lucius rushes home  but cant find his sponsa
He decides to wait for her  and lights an oil lamp
Ash and pumice begin raining over Pompeii
Fabia shelters with her husband Claudius and their daughters
But after a few hours their roof groans  under the weight of volcanic debris
and they realize they can't stay
They decide to travel southeast away from the volcano
The family joins swarms of people wading through hot ash on the cardo maximus
and begins navigating towards  one of Pompeiis southern gates
Marcus finally reaches his home  in Herculaneum
and gathers his wife and children
They decide to escape by sea
But as they approach the docks
they discover waves brimming  with volcanic matter
making it impossible for boats  to navigate close enough to shore
Trying to keep calm for their children they huddle underneath covered boat docks
Now the deadliest phase  of the disaster begins
At this point the force throwing  the volcanic material or tephra
into the air diminishes  and it comes crashing down
Hot ash and noxious gas billow out  in a wave known as a pyroclastic surge
This first surge engulfs Herculaneum
One hour later  another three times as strong
collapses the towns remaining structures
These have yet to reach Pompeii
but buildings are ablaze  in the hot sulfurous air
Lucius climbs out of his closet  and tries his front door
but a deep blanket of ash and stone  wont let it budge
His lamp flickers and dies
After more than  hours at times walking through ash up to their chests
Fabia her family and the others who left early enough
climb the southern Latarri mountains
They reach a peak and pause to look back
Another pyroclastic surge rushes across the valley crashes into Pompei
and sheers off the upper levels of the towns buildings
Fighting back tears Fabia continues  to push her family on towards safety
praying for her brothers and fellow townspeople
According to modern analysis the eruption may have lasted days or weeks
When it was over almost   square kilometers were decimated
and Pompeii and Herculaneum lay under up to  feet of tephra
Despite some disorganized looting and digging
these towns remained buried until official excavations began in the mids
Archaeologists have since analyzed  skeletal evidence and volcanic deposits
to reconstruct a timeline of Herculaneum  and Pompeiis final moments
They've revealed a poignant glimpse at the experiences of the eruption's victims
Much of our understanding of ancient Roman life
from food and furniture  to architecture and economics
comes from these ruins
In their time they were simply  provincial towns in the Bay of Naples
But their rediscovery has given us an  unparalleled view into the ancient world
and the lives that were devastated  by disaster

Whats as big as a polar bear  swallows its prey whole
and swims at  miles an hour
Its not a shark or a killer whale
Its the Atlantic bluefin tuna
The largest and longestlived of the  tuna species
the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set of adaptations
that make it one of the most dominant  predators in the ocean
It starts as a tiny hatchling in the  Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea
no bigger than a human eyelash
Within its first year of life
It develops something known as  regional endothermy
the ability to regulate its body temperature
An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen  from cold ocean water using its gills
This process cools its blood
Then heat the tuna generates swimming  and hunting warms the blood
In most fishes this heat would be lost back out into the ocean through the gills
But in the Atlantic bluefin
a mechanism called countercurrent exchange traps the heat
Cold blood on its way  to the large swimming muscles
passes close to warm blood  leaving those muscles
in a specialized network of blood vessels  known as a rete mirabile
Here the heat jumps to the cold blood and stays in the body
This makes bluefin one of the few  warmblooded fishes
a huge advantage  in the marine environment
Coldblooded animals whose  body temperature
depends entirely on the environment become sluggish in colder waters
But a bluefins ability to keep warm means it has sharper vision
can better process information and can swim faster than its prey
It thrives in cold deep subarctic water
Thanks to their warm bloodedness  their powerful muscles
and their streamlined torpedo shape
with fins that fold into grooves  to reduce drag
bluefin tuna can reach speeds few other animals can match
Their maximum speed of  miles per hour
is faster than that of a great white shark or orca whale
and even at their comfortable  cruising speed
they can cross the Atlantic in a couple months
All this swimming requires a great deal of oxygen
but the bluefin is adapted for this as well
The faster it swims the more water passes over its gills
and the more oxygen it can absorb from that water
This need for a constant flow of water
means the tuna must always remain  on the move
It also means bluefin cannot suck prey  into their mouths
the way most other fishes do
Instead they must chase down  their prey with their mouths open
They eat smaller prey than most predators their size
including squid crustaceans and smaller fish species like mackerel
The bluefins temperatureregulating ability
doesnt just make it a superior hunter  it gives it nearly unlimited range
As soon as theyre strong enough to swim against the current
Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters  of their spawning grounds
and spend their lives hunting all over the Atlantic Ocean
Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico  and the Mediterranean Sea
frequent the same feeding grounds
and range from Brazil and Texas  to Iceland and Senegal and beyond
But when the time comes to reproduce around age 
they always return to their sea of origin
Here groups of males and females release millions of eggs and sperm
into the water
Theyll migrate back and forth between  feeding and spawning grounds
annually for the rest of their lives
Atlantic bluefin can live  for over  years growing all the while
The largest specimens are tens of millions of times heavier than when they hatched
The same huge size that makes bluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean
has made them vulnerable to one predator in particular us
Humans have a long history of fishing Atlantic bluefin
its even stamped on ancient Greek coins
But in recent decades  demand has skyrocketed
as bluefin are hunted for sashimi sushi  and tuna steaks
An individual fish can sell  for  or more
promoting overfishing and illegal fishing
But if recent conservation efforts are redoubled and quotas are better enforced
bluefin populations can begin to recover

Dictionary noun  a malevolent literary device
for cramping the growth of a language  and making it hard and inelastic
Lexicographer noun a writer  of dictionaries a harmless drudge
While the concept of a dictionary  dates back to ancient civilizations
the first English dictionary was published by Robert Cawdrey in 
In the centuries that followed
many more dictionaries were written  by individual authors
who chose what to include or exclude
They not only defined words they openly  showcased their creators opinions
like Ambrose Bierces definition of dictionary
and Samuel Johnsons definition of lexicographer
After their authors deaths many of these dictionaries quickly became outdated
But one th century dictionary had a different fate
In  American lawyer and author Noah Webster published
An American Dictionary of the  English Language with a lofty goal
to give the United States its own version of the English language
He believed that as a new nation
the United States needed its own distinct version of English
to assert its independence from Britain
In his dictionary Webster sought  to describe and officialize
the way Americans spoke
Most dictionaries in Websters time  were prescriptive
they dictated how words should be used
rather than documenting the way people  actually used language in daily life
When Webster broke this convention and  included slang words in his dictionary
critics accused him of polluting the English language
But he argued that these words captured local variations of language
a vital part of what made American English unique
He also believed spelling rules were unnecessarily complex
and that we should write the way we speak as much as possible
Still Websters own opinions influenced the words he included
and the way he defined them
He excluded slang words  from Black communities
because he didnt consider them proper
And when he defined woman
he added that women are soft  mild pitiful and flexible
By the time of his death  Noah Webster was a household name
Seeing a lucrative business opportunity
brothers George and Charles Merriam bought the rights to Websters Dictionary
Together with Websters soninlaw  the Merriams made a new revised edition
It was the beginning  of the MerriamWebster Dictionary
Today the MerriamWebster Dictionary begins to address
a contradiction in Websters goal
he wanted to represent an entire nation
but he based his work on just one persons opinion his own
Since Websters death each new edition of the dictionary has been curated
by a group of language experts rather than by a single authority
The current criteria for including a word in the dictionary
are that it has widespread sustained and meaningful use
This clearly includes profanities
which were sometimes excluded  from dictionaries in the past
Racial slurs also meet the criteria for inclusion
but some argue that including them might legitimize them
Dictionaries dont just add new words
they also redefine old words to reflect changing attitudes and usage
One  dictionary defined wife as a married woman whose will
in the judgment of the law is subject to the will of her husband
for which reason a wife is said to have no will
Today wife is defined simply as  a female partner in a marriage
In  MerriamWebsters word of the year was they
The word has been in regular use for centuries
but has only recently gained a new recognized meaning
as a pronoun for one person whose  gender identity is nonbinary
The question of which words belong  in the dictionary impacts all of us
when our words and definitions  are represented theyre affirmed
if not they and we are minimized
Today lexicographers have expanded  word sourcing
to include the dictionarys users tracking which words are most searched
and adding them to the dictionary
So who decides whats in the dictionary
More than ever before the answer is  we do
All of us shape language every day
When we collectively embrace one word  or redefine another
eventually those words and meanings are reflected in our dictionaries

A decade ago
after a peaceful revolution toppled the longtime Tunisian dictator Ben Ali
I was sitting in an orange grove outside of Athens Greece
Undocumented migrants were hiding there
I came to interview them
about human rights abuses they had suffered while entering Europe
One of them a Tunisian fellow in a leather jacket explained
The people who overthrew Ben Ali
they want democracy and a dignified life
We who have crossed the Mediterranean want democracy and a dignified life
What is the difference
The migrant is a kind of revolutionary
This idea stuck with me
and informed my work as a lawyer and a scholar ever since
As Middle Eastern revolutions turned into civil wars
the refugee crisis unfolded in the Mediterranean
This exacerbated political pressures against asylum seekers
Initially the European Court of Human Rights
took a strong stand against border violence
In  the court decided
that Italy cannot turn asylum seekers back from the Mediterranean
to dangerous Libyan territory without first hearing them
The human rights community cheered
I was not one of those who cheered
In my scholarship
I predicted that this kind of decision could also generate bad results
States determined to enforce their own borders
could turn back asylum seekers
even before they enter the supervision of their own courts
I was regretfully correct
In recent years
the Italians have relied on Libyan militias to do their dirty work
So eager are some European governments
to ditch their own human rights obligations
they've equipped and armed Libyan militia
ignoring their rampant use of torture
This is also why since January 
more than  migrants have died by drowning in the Mediterranean
And since COVID began
the militarized border in the Mediterranean
has become in some ways even more extreme
But how does the militarized border cause deaths by drowning
I'd like to illustrate by a reference to a case I'm currently working on
On November  
a group of asylum seekers left the Libyan coast
and traveled through the Mediterranean hoping to reach Europe
As the overcrowded boat started to break down
they sent a distress signal
and under international law
states are obligated to facilitate the rescue of vessels in distress
Now a strange confrontation followed
Two vessels not one
came to pick up the asylum seekers in distress
One of them was sailing under a European flag
its crew in civilian clothing
The other was a Libyan vessel with its crew armed
and in the very uniform of the government that these people had fled
For the asylum seekers the choice was clear
Many jumped into the water
determined at all costs not to let the Libyans pick them up
Twenty people drowned
victims of a contemporary struggle for liberation across borders
What I didn't predict a few years back
was the courageous response of civil society volunteers
such as members of SeaWatch
who have literally inserted their bodies between the Libyan forces
and the migrants in the water
Crucially they've also brought back images
from cameras on board and body cams
These images allowed my colleagues
Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani
to visually reconstruct the events of November 
When they came to my team and me
asking that we go back to the European Court of Human Rights
I was hesitant
States always have ways to circumvent progressive human rights decisions
but the evidence spoke for itself
With my colleagues Violeta MorenoLax and Loredana Leo
we filed the case at the European Court of Human Rights
We argue that Italy as well as Europe
cannot rely on Libyan militia to sidestep their own accountability
On a high level of generality
the question is when is a point of contact established
between a person in need of protection
and a state that can protect them
I've called this moment the human rights encounter
It is a dramatic moment
in which legal commitments are put to an existential test
It's not about human rights law generally
but a particular person in a particular time
About simple commitments we have to each other as persons
It is not merely by chance that the sea becomes the environment
for this largescale struggle for liberation across borders
As for the court it has recognized the human rights encounter
when it's physical and direct
In the case I just told you about
we go further
Even when mediated by technology or by proxy forces
the underlying commitments to human rights should not change
In my organization the Global Legal Action Network
we pursue this case I told you about
as part of a strategic litigation program
We consider international law and the laws of many countries
We collaborate with researchers
and activists who use cutting edge technologies
to document violations across many borders
As war persecution and climate change continue
we believe this strategy will redefine the future of human rights lawyering
The future of human rights lawyering
is not only about a struggle against one corrupt leader or another
It's also about questions concerning
how do we all inhabit this planet together
Thank you

You know that whole thing about drinking eight glasses of water a day
Sorry to have to tell you this but it's a myth
It won't make your skin brighter
it won't make you feel clearheaded
it won't make you feel more energetic
It might however make you have to pee a lot

Many people don't understand the biology behind their bodies
There's a lot of misinformation out there
But the truth is that when you understand how your systems function
you're able to make better decisions
You're not as prone to fall for hype or pseudoscience
You'll feel empowered to understand what's really going on
One myth that really bugs me
is the idea that you need eight glasses of water a day
Honestly it's pretty shocking how ingrained it is
You hear it on TV you see it in articles
But like I said it's nonsense
For the most part
your body will tell you when you need to drink water
because you've got these wonderful amazing undervalued things 
kidneys
Kidneys are the beanshaped organs located to either side of your spine
right below your ribs
They're often thought of as a filter or a wasteremoval system
but that doesn't do the kidneys justice
Your body is an environment where everything fluid and chemicals
needs to be in a delicate balance
The kidneys do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to this balance
Every day blood in your body passes through the kidneys
What you eat drink the temperature around you
how much you exercise 
all of this affects what's going on with your body
Your kidneys along with your nervous system and various hormones
are constantly watching many gauges
and making adjustments about fluid salt and levels of other substances
in real time
They do this with about one million tiny structures called nephrons
These nephrons are kind of like workers on a conveyor belt
actively adding things and taking things away
things like sodium glucose or sugar calcium amino acids and water
to make sure the body maintains homeostasis or balance
If levels of anything get too high or too low
then that can be harmful
And it is the job of the kidneys
to keep the levels of many of these substances in the justright zone
Substances that aren't needed leave the kidney
and head to the bladder
where you excrete them in the form of urine
So where do eight glasses of water a day fit in
They don't
Noticed that I did not say
that the kidney function is improved with excess water
Imagine that you're sweating a lot
so you're losing water from your blood
The kidneys know your blood volume is dropping ever so slightly
and that your blood is getting ever so slightly saltier
They compensate by absorbing more water back into the blood
making the urine more concentrated
If the kidneys sense enough fluid can't be reabsorbed from the urine
you're signaled to drink meaning you get thirsty
If you don't have fluid available
the thirst message gets stronger and stronger
A person facing real dehydration won't be unsure if they need water
They'll do whatever they need to get it
It's one of our most basic instincts
that's evolved over a very long time
in environments where clean water
wasn't nearly as readily available as it is today
So thanks to your kidneys
your body is really good at maintaining hydration
But if you stop counting eight glasses of water a day
how much should you be drinking
The answer is simple
there is no should
When you feel thirsty drink some water
You can trust your body
Unless you have kidney stones or are elderly 
sometimes our messaging systems get a little worn with age 
or your doctor has told you otherwise
constantly monitoring how much water you drink
is not really necessary
Here's a point that's often missed
every single thing you consume contains water
Your morning coffee has water so does your breakfast
And that snack  an apple an orange a glass of juice a granola bar 
just like you they're made of water too
So as long as you're listening to your body's internal sense of thirst
there's really no need to be counting those eight glasses

How often do you poop
You might have heard you should have a bowel movement once a day
But the truth is that if you poop anywhere from three times a day
to three times a week
you're completely and totally normal
Music
[Body Stuff with Dr Jen Gunter]

Hey there its Dr Jen Gunter
As an obgyn and painmedicine doctor
I end up talking to my patients about poop more than you might think
Overall I hear a lot of anxiety about it
Some people worry about not having a bowel movement once a day
even though its a phony metric
Other people struggle with constipation
Often they don't get the treatment that they need
and they can even turn to dangerous solutions
such as colon cleanses
But for all the poop talk there's one word I don't hear enough 
fiber
Let me take you through the journey from food to poop
Digestion actually starts in the mouth
Chewing breaks the food down into smaller particles
As you eat your food mixes with saliva
which moistens the food
and has enzymes that start to break down those starches and fats
Contractions is your esophagus push the food to your stomach
where acid and gastric juices and enzymes further break the food down
The food then travels to the small intestine
where fats proteins carbohydrates and micronutrients
are further broken down with help from the pancreas gallbladder liver
and the microbiome
so they can be absorbed across the small intestine
and sent to the liver for processing
What's left moves to the large intestine or the colon
which has three main jobs
absorbing water and electrolytes producing and absorbing vitamins
and forming and squeezing the material now called stool
towards the rectum
When the rectum is full it sends a signal to the brain
and the brain takes into account whether it's a socially acceptable time to poop
and if it is it sends a signal to the anal sphincter muscles to relax
And boom you know what happens next
This process involves more than  organs
and typically takes anywhere from  to  hours
in healthy people
So it's helpful to think of poop as exactly what it is 
all the stuff that doesn't get digested in this process
It is water bacteria dead cells and mucus
all glommed together with fiber
Fiber is amazing
It affects the digestive tract from top to bottom
It is very simply a carbohydrate the body can't absorb
While other carbs are broken down into sugars
fiber passes by sort of moseying along doing all kinds of cool things
Highfiber foods physically take longer to eat
so they help us pace our meals
The bulk also slows down digestion especially in the stomach
and makes you feel full longer
Fiber also draws water into the stool keeping it soft
Scratchy hard stool is to put it mildly unpleasant
It also increases bacterial mass
The water and bacteria together increase the bulk of the stool
which helps it move along
Fiber also slows absorption of sugars into the bloodstream
and reduces absorption of fats and cholesterols
And as fiber collects in your colon
it feeds all your good gut bacteria
helping you maintain a healthy microbiome
Fiber is associated with the reduced risk of diabetes
heart disease several gastrointestinal conditions
and even certain cancers
And yet most of us aren't getting enough of it
For example in the US
the vast majority of adults
aren't eating the recommended  grams of fiber per day
In fact the average American just gets  grams of fiber a day
So how exactly do you get more fiber
The generic answer is to eat more whole grains
fruits vegetables and legumes
But I want you to consider some more specific fiberrich foods
that I personally love
pears raspberries and blackberries avocados and artichokes
highfiber cereals whole grains  my favorite is farro 
lentils kidney beans and chickpeas
Almonds pistachios and sunflower seeds are other options
When in doubt reach for those
And happy pooping

This is a lump of coal
It was mined a while ago in the Ruhr region in Germany
about  miles from where I grew up
As coal goes it's actually quite highend
It's very dry it has a high share of carbon in it
Both those things mean you can't only burn it
to produce power and heat
but you can use it to make steel
Now why am I telling you this
By the end of this talk
I want to have convinced you that we can make a huge step forward
in the great fight against climate change
by just spending one to two percent more on things that we buy
And the path of this coal is going to help me with it
But 
back to steel
What you have to know about steelmaking is that it's a humblingly brutal process
These huge furnaces that tear apart and recombine elements and materials
that have literally been around for millions of years
at temperatures of up to more than  degrees Celsius
It's a triumph of industrialization
but it's terrible for the climate
More than five percent of all manmade emissions
currently come from making steel
And of all the many challenges we face to save the climate
this one's particularly hard to solve
Now why is that
The first reason is technical
There are technologies to produce lowcarbon steel
We can for example capture the CO
and pump it back under the earth 
that's called carbon capture and storage
Or we can move to entirely new processes
that for example run on lowcarbon hydrogen instead of coal
But all of these are currently only at a piloting stage
The second reason is economical
This is likely going to be expensive
And to illustrate that
let's compare the steel challenge to that of companies in other sectors
If you're in say manufacturing
most of your emissions come from the power you consume
for things like conveyor belts robots drives and so on
You can eliminate them by switching to renewables
which isn't that expensive anymore
In most cases this wont cost you more than  euros per ton of CO
probably a lot less
Other companies have more energyintensive processes
that require a lot of heat to operate
They generate more emissions by burning fossil fuels directly
and that's more expensive to get rid of
Now let's assume across all of their processes
it costs them on average five times as much
somewhere between  and  euros per ton of CO
Now if a steel company wants to move to zero emissions
it either needs to invest significantly in upgrading all of its current plants
and into infrastructure that transports CO
from its plants to a storage site
or it needs to close all its plants and build entirely new ones
that for example run on lowcarbon hydrogen
According to industry studies this can cost them  times as much
in the ballpark of  euros per ton of CO
and the costs for a ton of steel could increase by as much as  percent
Now to make matters even worse
our steel company operates in the commodity business
it almost exclusively competes on price
And it has shitty margins already
that means saving CO is expensive
but its profit per ton of CO is very low
and this puts it in the uncomfortable company
of only a few other sectors
the socalled hardtoabate sectors club
all the industries like cement and chemicals
that have equally messy industrial processes
and require very high temperatures to operate
or aviation and shipping
that need to invest a lot of energy
to move very large and heavy objects over longer distances
And hardtoabate sectors are one of the larger dilemmas
of international climate action
because discussions around decarbonization usually go roughly like this
Well the activist says
Your emissions are harming the planet and threatening humanity
You need to change immediately
And the company answers
I know But if I invest in lowcarbon technologies
and the next guy doesn't
we'll be more expensive and go out of business
It won't help the climate
So first I need a level playing field
Both understandable positions
but bringing down emissions is kind of urgent
and a global level playing field
in which say
all countries agree on one mutual price for carbon emissions
probably won't materialize anymore in my lifetime
So this is where the discussions usually reach a stalemate
and where my talk would therefore end
But would it end here I wouldnt have been invited to hold it
and I already promised you
that saving the planet does not have to break the bank
So let's maybe follow the path of our lump of coal
just a little further
The last time we left it it had helped make steel
which climate impact notwithstanding
is one of the key building blocks of our economies
It's in many many things
from huge structures to everyday household items
like refrigerators or washing machines
We use it to build wind turbines
which we need to save emissions in the power sector
and we use it to build our cars
which is the part of the journey I'd like us to follow next
Now in today's typical car
steel can be found in many many different parts
You can assume that an average European midsized sedan
with a  euro price tag
contains about one ton of it
To produce one ton of steel in Europe
generates a bit less than two tons of carbon emissions
In other countries like China it's a bit more so let's round to two
Now we've learned earlier
that moving to lowcarbon steel can increase its costs
by as much as  percent
If history tells us anything
then these costs will likely decrease over the long run
if humans truly put their mind their muscle their money behind it
But for the sake of this argument let's stick to these costs
plus  percent
In the case of our European midsize sedan this translates into 
wait for it 
 euros
Wait that can't be right
That's not even a percent of the final sales value
Well let's do the math
If you spend  euros for a car what are you actually paying for
Well first of all the car company needs to make money
So the first  percent are for its margin for marketing
the whole sales organization overhead and so on
The car needs to be assembled 
another  percent goes to production
First the parts of the car have to be assembled 
 percent go to suppliers
In this whole process
many things need to be moved from A to B and back
so more goes to transportation
Now only  percent of the price of the car
is actually for the materials in it
Things like the battery aluminum plastics glass
and two percent for the steel
This means that materials
that make up  percent of a car's emission footprint
by the time that I can buy it in the dealership
make up only  percent of its costs
And it means that even [though] the car company has to pay  percent more
for the steel in the car
this only translates into a very small markup
on my final sales price
Now you would rightly argue that steel isn't the only thing
creating emissions in the car
And that's of course correct
So we did the math for other commodities and processes as well
And it turns out building a  euro car
out of exclusively carbonneutral materials
would only increase its price to  euros
only  euros extra
It's less than two percent more
Buying that same car in sunset red instead of black
would cost me  euros extra
Fancier rims   euros extra
Leather seats   euros extra
You get the picture
So let's imagine
that same discussion we had earlier but with a car producer in the middle
where the activist says
Your emissions are harming the planet and threatening humanity
You need to change immediately
And now a car producer answers
I know
But if I invest in lowcarbon materials and the next guy doesn't
my car will be two percent more expensive
Wait 
My customers might actually pay that
And I can market all my cars as carbonneutral
Steel producer
your steel is creating too many emissions in my car
You have to change immediately
I can make lowcarbon steel for you
but it will be more expensive
How much more expensive
And now we at least have a dialog
Almost everything about the way we currently live
currently contributes to global warming
Most of the things we buy come with a heavy emissions backpack
that few of us are really aware of
What I want you to understand
is that we can eliminate a lot of these emissions
by just spending one to two percent more on things that we buy
We've learned what it would cost to produce a carbonneutral car
So how about a carbonneutral smartphone
Three euros extra
That's  cents a month on a twoyear plan
A carbonneutral pair of jeans  to  cents extra
Even building a house out of carbonneutral materials
would only increase its costs by two to three percent
and even less in good locations
There are six supply chains
that are responsible for almost half of all global emissions
that we can impact directly through our purchasing decisions
Those are things like food construction fashion
consumer goods electronics and of course automotive
And just like in the car example
materials make up only a fraction of the final sales price in most of them
Addressing these emissions could be a huge step forward
for international climate action
It would enable customerfacing companies
that can benefit from marketing carbonneutral products
to address a multiple of their direct emissions footprints
And many of these emissions are in sectors like steel
that can shoulder the costs on their own
Some are in countries that dont yet  regulate emissions aggressively enough
Take the Chucks Im wearing now
Me being willing to spend two percent more on them
could have reduced the production emissions in China
Now I'm well aware that not everyone can easily afford
to spend these two percent extra
but we have to be aware that the economic consequences
let alone the human ones
of not spending this money
would be far far worse
We have to move to net zero
Fairly distributing the costs of this
is one of the many challenges
that we as a society will need to deal with
I'm also not saying that this will be easy
Understanding supplychain emissions is unbelievably cumbersome
Engaging with suppliers to address them takes a lot of effort
What we would argue is that for many companies
the chance to market a truly carbonneutral product
at just a onetotwo percent higher price
should be well worth this effort
Just imagine
you're standing in a store
with two brands of the same product in front of you
One is carbonneutral  it costs two percent more
Which of these two products would you rather buy
Imagine you had the chance
to work for either one of these two companies
Who would you rather work for
Imagine you were an investor
On which of these two companies would you bet your money
Which of these two do you think will be more successful in the long run
To solve the climate crisis there's still a lot we need to figure out
There are many challenges we need to overcome
But economics don't have to be one of them
Thank you

In  two Black men went to a Starbucks
to wait for a business associate
But when they asked to use the bathroom
the manager ordered them to leave
They refused
He called the police
and the video went viral
Amidst an avalanche of bad publicity
Starbucks closed all stores across the country
for four hours of diversity training
And so baristas were handed workbooks
with prompts like What makes me me and you you
and Understanding our bias from colorblind to color brave
This made newspapers across the country
and arguably that was the goal
Look everyone We're solving our diversity problem
The assumption though was that you could address structural racism
with an earnest conversation about our feelings
My take
give me a break
To address structural racism you need to change structures
So in the aftermath of George Floyd's death
my sense is that many companies are feeling pressure
to actually deliver on their diversity goals
but they haven't a clue what to do
And that's because we spent probably close to a billion dollars on diversity
But the basic tools of the diversity industrial complex
they just don't work
A oneshot bias training 
it doesn't work for a really simple reason
doing anything once won't change a company's culture
And the other basic tools 
things like an employee resource group or a women's initiative 
they're fine
if the problem is with the women and the people of color
But it's not
If a company faces challenges surrounding diversity
typically it's because subtle and notsosubtle forms of bias
are constantly being transmitted through their basic business systems 
through hiring through performance evaluations
through access to opportunities
So we need to stop trying to fix the women and the people of color
We need to fix the business systems
And if you think about it this makes sense
because if a company was facing challenges with sales
it wouldn't respond by holding a series of sincere conversations
about how much we all value sales
and put on programming for National Celebrate Sales Month
and expect sales to improve
But that's a lot of what we're doing in the diversity context
If we really want to tackle diversity effectively
we need to use the same tools businesses use to tackle any business problem 
evidence and metrics
And you know I suspect this will come as a relief
to a lot of CEOs who feel far more comfortable using those tools
than they do with trying to lead a deep conversation
about the inner workings of social inequality
The first step
is for us to understand what bias looks like on the ground
And I and my team at WorkLife Law
we have been studying how bias plays out in everyday workplace interactions
for well over a decade
And what we find is that the same patterns of bias
the same five patterns
they emerge over and over again
So here's what the evidence looks like
The first pattern we call prove it again
Some groups have to prove themselves more than others
This is triggered by lots of different things
It's triggered by race and gender
age disability LGBTQ status
even social class
So one study for example
looked at callbacks offered to white men with identical qualifications
but different hobbies
One rsum listed things like sailing and polo
and the other rsum listed things like
counseling firstgeneration college students
and country music
And if you can believe it Mr Polo 
he got  times the number of callbacks as Mr Country Music
Too often when we talk about privilege we forget about class
The second pattern is called the tightrope
and it reflects the fact that a certain ingroup of white men
just need to be authoritative and ambitious in order to succeed
But women walk a tightrope
where they may be seen as abrasive if they're authoritative
but unqualified if they're not
And people of color who behave assertively often are written off
as angry if they're Black
even hotheaded if they're Latinx
and sometimes as untrustworthy if they're Asian American
The next pattern we call the tugofwar
and it reflects the fact that sometimes bias against a group
fuels conflict within the group
So for example if there's room for only one woman or person of color
it's entirely predictable
women are going to be supercompetitive with other women
and people of color competitive with other people of color
The fourth pattern of bias is actually the strongest form of gender bias
called the maternal wall
And it reflects assumptions that mothers aren't committed
probably shouldn't be
and aren't competent 
think pregnancy brain
So mothers often find they have to prove themselves yet again
when they return from maternity leave
And if they do they may be seen as bad mothers and so as bad people
and disliked
The final pattern consists of racial stereotypes
So Asian Americans again and again report
that they're seen as a great match for technical skills
but lacking in leadership potential
And our studies show that Black professionals again and again
report really high levels of isolation
and often startling forms of disrespect
And an Asian American professional may be seen as too emotional
in a discussion where you know what
a white man behaving exactly the same way
would be seen as having a careerenhancing passion for the business
And so what we find is that white women report four patterns of bias
Men of color also report four
Women of color report all five in very substantial proportions
And among women of color
Black women report the most bias as a group
But the bottom line really is that the experience of white men as a group
differs from that of every other group
If a white man is a firstgeneration professional or LGBTQ
he may encounter bias
But but most aren't
These biases can have really serious negative effects
There's a ton of research
But here's a story that really says it all
We were working with one company and we spoke to a woman engineer
who had found a mistake in one of the calculations
of a male colleague
and she pointed it out
When she pointed it out
she was violating an unwritten rule
The good woman is seen as modest selfeffacing and nice
not a missiondriven expert
That's why male experts in meetings exert more influence
But you know what
Female experts they actually exert less influence than female nonexperts do
And so when this engineer pointed out the mistake in calculation she told us
the response of her department was so massively negative that she said
Now I'm just smiling a lot and bringing in cupcakes
This company by allowing gender bias to go unchecked
was literally jeopardizing their mission
So what's the solution
The solution is to use bias interrupters
new tools my team has developed
that are evidencebased and metricsdriven
And I've just told you about a lot of the evidence
Metrics are also superimportant
because they help you pinpoint where things are going wrong
So if a company has challenges with hiring
they should be keeping track of who is in the original pool of candidates
and who survives rsum review
and who gets called to interview
and who survives the interview
And the reason that's important is because the fix
if you have a nondiverse original pool
is totally different than the fix if no woman ever survives the interview
because every woman is either too witchy
or too meek
Metrics are also superimportant for another reason
to establish baselines
and measure progress
If you use evidence and metrics
what we have found is that small tweaks can have really big effects
So we've worked with one company for example
who asked us to look at their performance evaluations
And when we did
we found that only  percent of the people of color
had leadership mentioned in their performance evaluations
That was  points lower than white women
And that was superimportant because as you can imagine
mentions of leadership predicted advancement
And so we worked with them to do two simple things
First we redesigned the performance evaluations form
And second we help them develop a simple onehour workshop that
among other things
projected actual comments from the prior year's performance evaluations
and asked people a simple question
Which of the five patterns of bias does this represent
or is it no bias
Just doing that we found in year two
 percent of the people of color had leadership mentioned
in their performance evaluations
At this company white women they had a different problem
Almost  percent had comments in their performance evaluations
that they didn't really want to make partner 
this was a partnership
And we suspected the women hadn't actually said that
It was just assumptions
And so in that onehour workshop we told people
Hey don't say this unless you've actually had a conversation
and someone has told you they don't want to make partner
In year two only one woman got that comment 
one woman in the entire company
And so what we find is that we have helped over  companies
actually make progress towards their diversity goals
And there's growing evidence that these bias interrupters work
And the best thing about them is that they help every single group
So in this company I've been talking about
in year two people of color got wildly more constructive feedback 
it was like a percent jump
But white women they got more constructive feedback too
and so did white men
If you design your systems based on evidence
it's going to help every single group
So the bottom line if you think about it your systems and your culture
they reflect the people you've already hired
So if you want to replicate that workforce into the future
definitely keep on doing exactly what you're doing
But if you don't
if you actually want to make progress
on diversity equity and inclusion  what we call DEI 
my message to CEOs is reassuring
you already know what to do
Use standard business tools
start from the evidence
gather metrics to establish baselines and measure progress
and keep at it until you achieve your goals
That's the new DEI playbook
And it works
Thank you

Christiana Figueres Today February  
at the beginning of a crucial year and a crucial decade
for confronting the climate crisis
the United States rejoins the Paris Climate Agreement
after four years of absence
Unanimously adopted by  nations
the Paris Agreement came into force in 
establishing targets and mechanisms
to lead the global economy to a zeroemissions future
It was one of the most extraordinary examples of multilateralism ever
and one which I had the privilege to coordinate
One year later the United States withdrew
The BidenHarris administration is now bringing the United States back
and has expressed strong commitment to responsible climate action
The two men you are about to see both played essential roles
in birthing the Paris Agreement in 
Former Vice President Al Gore a lifelong climate expert
made key contributions to the diplomatic process
John Kerry was the US Secretary of State
and head of the US delegation
With his granddaughter sitting on his lap
he signed the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States
He is now the US Special Envoy for Climate
TED Countdown has invited Al Gore to interview John Kerry
as he begins his new role
Over to both of them
Al Gore Well thank you Christiana
and John Kerry thank you so much for doing this interview
I have to say on a personal basis
I was just absolutely thrilled when President Biden
then presidentelect
announced you were going to be taking on this incredibly important role
And thank you for doing it
Let me just start by welcoming you to TED Countdown and asking you
how are you feeling as you step back into the middle of this issue
that has been close to your heart for so long
John Kerry Well I feel safer being here with you
I honestly I feel very energized very focused
I think it's a privilege to be able to take on this task
And as you know better than anybody
it's going to take everybody coming together
There's going to have to be a massive movement of people
to do what we have to do
So I feel privileged to be part of it
and Im honored to be here with you on this important day
AG Well it's been a privilege
to be able to work with a dear friend for so long on this crisis
And of course on this historic day
when the United States now formally and legally rejoins
the Paris Agreement
we have to acknowledge
that the world is lagging behind the pace of change needed
to successfully confront the climate crisis
because even if all countries kept the commitments
made under the Paris Agreement 
and I watched you sign it you had your grandchild with you 
I was there at the UN that was an inspiring moment
you signed on behalf of the United States
but even if all of those pledges were kept
they're not strong enough to keep the global temperature increase
well below two degrees or below  degrees
and emissions are still rising
So what needs to happen here in the US and globally
in order to accelerate the pace of change
JK Well Al you're absolutely correct
It's a very significant day a day that never had to happen
America returning to this agreement
It is so sad that our previous president without any scientific basis
without any legitimate economic rationale
decided to pull America out
And it hurt us and it hurt the world
Now we have an opportunity to try to make that up
And I approach that job with a lot of humility
for the agony of the last four years of not moving faster
But we have to simply up our ambition on a global basis
United States is  percent of all the emissions
China is  percent
EU is somewhere around   depends who you talk to
And India is about seven
So you add all those together just four entities
and you've got well over  percent of all the emissions in the world
And yet none of those nations
are at this moment doing enough
to be able to get done what has to be done
let alone many others at lower levels of emission
It's going to take all of us
Even if tomorrow China went to zero
or the United States went to zero
you know full well Al we're still not going to get there
We all have to be reducing greenhouse gas emissions
We have to do it much more rapidly
So the meeting in Glasgow rises in its importance
You and I we've been to these meetings
since way back in the beginning of the 's with Rio
and even before some of them parliamentary meetings
And were at this most critical moment
where we have a capacity to define the decade of the 's
which will really make or break us
in our ability to get to a  net zero carbon economy
And so we all have to raise our ambition
That means coal has got to phase down faster
It means we've got to deploy renewables
all forms of alternative renewable sustainable energy
We've got to push the curve of discovery intensely
Whether we get to hydrogen economy or battery storage
or any number of technologies
we are going to have to have an alloftheabove approach
to getting where we need to go
to meet the target in this next  years
And I think Glasgow has to not only have countries come and raise ambition
but those countries are going to have to define
in real terms
what their road map is for the next  years
then the next  years
so that we're really talking a reality
that we've never been able to completely assemble
at any of these meetings thus far
AG Well hearing you talk John
just highlights how painful it's been for the US to be absent
from the international effort for the last four years
and again it makes me so happy President Biden has brought us back
into the Paris Agreement
After this four year hiatus
how are you personally as our Climate Envoy
planning to approach reentry into the conversation
I know you've already started it
but is there anything tricky about that
Or I guess everything is tricky about it but how are you planning to do it
JK Well I'm planning first of all to do it with humility
because I think it's not appropriate for the United States to leap back in
and start telling everybody what has to happen
We have to listen
We have to work very very closely with other countries
many of whom have been carrying the load for the last four years
in the absence of the United States
I don't think we come in Al I want to emphasize this 
I don't believe we come to the table with our heads hanging down
on behalf of many of our own efforts
because as you know President Obama worked very hard
and we all did together with you and others
to get the Paris Agreement
And we also have  states in America
that have passed renewable portfolio laws
And during the four years of Trump being out
the governors of those  states Republican and Democrat alike
continued to push forward and we're still in movement
And more than a thousand mayors
the mayors of our biggest cities in America
all have forged ahead
So it's not a totally abjectly miserable story by the United States
I think we can come back and earn our credibility
by stepping up in the next month or two
with a strong national determined contribution
Were going to have a summit on April 
That summit will bring together the major emitting nations of the world again
And because as you recall in Paris
a number of nations felt left out of the conversation
The island states some of the poorer nations Bangladesh others
And so we're going to bring those stakeholders to the table
as well as the big emitters and developed countries
so that they can be heard from the getgo
And as we head on into Glasgow
hopefully we'll be building a bigger momentum
and we'll have a larger consensus
And that's our goal 
have the summit raise ambition
announce our national determined contribution
begin to break ground on entirely new initiatives
build towards the biodiversity convention in China
even though we're not a party we want to be helpful
and then go into the G the G the UNGA
the meeting of the United Nations in the fall
reconvene and reenergize going for the last six weeks into Glasgow
In my judgment Glasgow and you'd know this full well
I think Glasgow is the last best hope we have
for our nations to really set us on that path
And so you know one key is as I said raising ambition
The other is defining how you're going to get there
and then the third is finance
We've got to bring an unprecedented global finance plan to the table
And I think we're already working with private sector entities
I believe there's a way to do that in a very exciting way
AG Well that's encouraging
and I'm going to come back to that in just a moment
But I'm glad you made those points about state and local governments
actually moving forward during the last four years
A lot of US private companies have as well
And already I'm extremely encouraged by the suite of executive actions
that President Biden has already taken
during his first weeks in office
And there's more to come
There's also a push for legislative action
to invest in the fantastic new opportunities
in clean energy electric vehicles and more
Yet you and I have both seen the difficulties
of this approach in the past
How can we use all of this activity
to well and truly convince the world
that America is genuinely back to being part of the solution
I know we are
You know we are
but we've got to really restore that confidence
I think your appointment went a long way to doing that
But what else can we do to gain back the world's confidence
JK Well we have to be honest and forthright and direct
about the things that we're prepared to do
And they have to be things we're really going to do
We just held a meeting a few days ago with all of the domestic entities
that President Biden has ordered to come to the table
and be part of this effort
This is an allofgovernment effort now
So we will have the Energy Department the Homeland Security Department
the Defense Department the Treasury
I mean Janet Yellen was there talking about how she's going to work
and we're going to work together to try to mobilize some of the finance
So I think you know
we're not going to convince anybody by just saying it
Nor should we
We have to do it
And I think the actions that we put together
shortly after President Biden achieves the COVID legislation here
he will almost immediately introduce the rebuild effort
the infrastructure components
and those will be very much engaged in building out America's grid capacity
doing things that we should have done years ago
to facilitate the transmission of electricity
from one part of the country to another
whether it's renewable or otherwise
We just don't have that ability now
We have a queue of backed up projects
sitting in one of our regulatory agencies
which have got to be broken free
And by creating this allofgovernment effort Al
our hope is we're really going to be able to do that
The other thing that we're doing is I'm reaching out very rapidly
to colleagues all around the world
We've had meetings already discussions with India
with Latin American countries
with European countries
with the European Commission and others
And we're going to try to build as much energy and momentum as possible
towards these various benchmarks that I've talked about
And I mean the proof will be in the pudding
We're going to have to show people that we've got a strong NDC
we're actually implementing we're passing legislation
and we're moving forward in a collegiate manner
with other countries around the world
For instance I've talked to Australia we had a very good conversation
Australia has had some differences with us
We've not been able to get on the same page completely
That was one of the problems in Madrid as you recall together with Brazil
Well I've reached out to Brazil already we're starting to work on that
My hope is that we can build some new coalitions and approach this
hopefully in a new way
AG Well that's exciting
and I do agree with your statement earlier
that the COP conference in Glasgow this fall
may be the world's last best chance
I like your phrase there
From your perspective
what would you list as the priorities
for ensuring that this Glasgow conference is a success
JK I think that perhaps one of the single most important things
which is why we're focused on this summit of ours
is to get the  nations
that produced the vast majority of emissions
on the same page of committing to  net zero
committing to this decade
having a road map that is going to lay down
how they are going to accelerate the reduction of emissions
in a way that keeps  degrees as a floor alive
and also in a way that guarantees
that we are seeing the road map to get to net zero
I will personally be dissatisfied disappointed
if for our children's sake and our grandkids sake
we can't say that when these adults came together to make this kind of a decision
we didn't actually make it
We've got to make it
And I think if we can show people we're actually on the road
I think you believe this as much as I do
that 
I mean you're far more knowledgeable than I am about some of the technologies
and you've helped break ground on some of them
The pace at which we are now beginning to accelerate
I mean the reduction in cost of solar
the movement in storage and other kinds of things
I'm convinced we're going to find one breakthrough or another
I don't know what it's going to be
but I do know that when we push the curve
and we put the resources to work
the innovative creative capacity of humankind is such
that we have an ability to surprise ourselves
We've always done it
When we went to the Moon in this incredible backdrop behind you
And that's exactly what we did
And people today use products in everyday household use
that came out of that quest that you never would have anticipated
That's what's going to happen now
We can move faster to electric vehicles
No question in my mind
we could absolutely phase down coalfired emissions
faster than we are in a plan to do it
So the available choices are there
The test is going to be whether we create the energy and momentum
necessary to actually get those choices made
AG One of the big challenges is one you referred to earlier on finance
Wealthy countries have promised financial assistance
to the less wealthy countries to help them out with cutting emissions
and to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis
But of course we need to continue to work to meet this commitment
especially as countries around the world rebuild their economies
in the wake of this pandemic
What are some of the most effective ways
in which the wealthier countries can help those
that don't have as many resources
and why is this so important for the world to move forward
JK Let me answer the last part first
It's so important
because it's the only way we're going to get there
I don't believe that any government has either the money or the inclination
to be able to do what's necessary here
I believe the private sector
particularly driven by venture capital investment
by the quest to be able to create a product
that then can help create wealth
and actually provide a benefit to humankind
drives a lot of things that we've done all through history
And I don't think it'll be any different now
I think the question is
can we pull together enough nations
to leverage a uniform approach to the judgment
about the kinds of investments that are being made
And I believe that if we can standardize to some degree
with disclosure requirements
which Janet Yellen is now seized of that issue
and Europe there are folks working on that
and European Commission elsewhere
if we could actually find a way to come together
and harmonize some of those definitions
and the marketplace begins to make those judgments as they qualify risk
looking way out
risk because of climate crisis
for investing is very very real
And we all understand that
We spent  billion dollars in America two years ago
just cleaning up after three storms
Maria Harvey and Irma
And it's crazy
You spend  billion to clean up after the storms
but we can't put  billion together for the Green Climate Fund
That's what this year has to be about
We've got to break that cycle
And I think business I'm convinced of this
a lot of people will doubt me and say have I lost my mind
but I'm convinced the private sector is going to be critical
if not the key to helping to make this happen
And that will leverage other money
I've talked to the IMF
we'll be talking with the World Bank
we're going to try to bring our own
Finance Development Corporation in America
All of these things can help leverage investment
into the sectors that can make the greatest difference
to the rapid reduction of greenhouse gases
And I think people are going to get very excited
about where this money is going to go
and how much it is going to be
And my hope is in a matter of weeks to be in a position
to make a couple of announcements with respect to that
that could be helpful in building some of this momentum
AG Well that's great
It sounds like some major news coming in a couple of weeks
and just one example you used the point about businessmen
I have a friend in Australia Mike CannonBrookes
building a long undersea cable from the northern territories of Australia
to take renewable electricity to Singapore
You have made the point
about the need for the US to approach this with humility
a number of times
In that spirit
what lessons can a country like ours learn
from some of the lower income nations
that are already beginning to tackle climate change
JK Well I think one of the most important things Al
is to make sure that central
to this transformation
to this transition to the new energy economy
central to it is environmental justice
is that we don't leave people behind
that we're not making whole communities
the recipients of the downside of some particular choice
that the diesel trucks for instance
aren't all being routed through a particular low income community
that doesn't have the ability to make a different political decision
I think it is vital for the developed world
to recognize that there are nations
 nations or more
way below one percent in terms of emissions
And they're looking around some of them like Tommy Remengesau
the president of Palau
who no longer can consider adaptation
he's got to figure out where his people are going to go live
as do other very lowlying areas in the ocean
So that impact on people is really not known
by the vast majority of people who live pretty good lives
in a lot of countries in the world
And we have a responsibility to make sure
that we're learning the lesson of their lives
and of their hopes and aspirations here
AG Couldn't agree more
And here in the US
if we had paid more attention to the differential impact on Black
Brown and Indigenous communities
we would have had a better early warning of what the whole country was facing
But let me shift subjects and ask you about China
I know that you
as you are close friends with Xie Zhenhua
as I have been over the years
and I was very happy when he was brought out of retirement
to play the lead role for them
But the US is now in the middle
of a somewhat contentious relationship with China
But successfully solving the climate crisis
is going to require collaboration between the US and China
we're the two biggest emitters and the two biggest economies
How can this collaboration be shaped in your view
I know you played a role
as Joe Biden did before the Paris Agreement
in getting our two countries together
Can we do that again
JK I hope so
I really do hope so Al
As you just said if we can 
if we don't get China to be cooperating and partnering
with the rest of the world on this
we don't solve the problem
And we unfortunately
we see too much investment in China right now in coal still
We've had some conversations about it
I was on a panel with Xie Zhenhua several months before the election
by the University of California
and we had a very constructive conversation
My hope is that that will continue and can continue
and that China will be just as constructive if not more so
in this endeavor than they were in 
as we began the process to build up to Paris
AG Well that relationship is absolutely crucial
But in order to cover all the ground I want to cover here
let me shift again and ask you
what role do you expect that big corporations
and also smaller businesses will play
in moving this green transition forward
JK I think they're the biggest single players in it
I mean governments are important
and governments can and have made a difference with tax credits
For instance our solar tax credit made an enormous difference
and it will make one going forward
And even in the middle of COVID we've been able to hold on to that
But we need to grow those kinds of efforts
But in the end
it's not going to be government cash that makes this happen
It's going to be the private sector investment that is coming in
because it's the right thing to do because it's also smart investing
And the truth is you can talk to many 
and you have you're one of the investors actually Al 
you and others have proven that you can invest in this sector
of dealing with climate or environment or sustainability
whether it's ESG or it's pure climate
There are ways to have a good return on money
And during the last couple of years
we had something like  to  trillion dollars
sitting in parked banking situations around the world
in net negative interest
In other words they were paying for the privilege of sitting there
not invested in something
And so I think there's just a massive opportunity here
And most of the CEOs I am talking to at least now
are increasingly aware of the potential of these alternatives
And you were in early
I don't know if you invested in it or not
but I know you're involved with Tesla or have been
Tesla is the most highly valued automobile company in the world
And it only makes one thing electric car
If that isn't a message to people I don't know what is
AG I wish I had invested in Tesla John
but I'm a huge fan of Elon Musk and what he's doing
I'm also a huge fan of Greta Thunberg
And I'm just curious
what you think in practical terms is the real impact for change
coming from these youth movements like Fridays for the Future
JK I think it's been gigantic and spectacular
and in the best traditions of what young people do
and have done historically
I mean as you recall in America at least in the s
it was young people who drove the environment movement
the peace movement the women's movement the civil rights movement
and they were willing to put their lives on the line
And Greta has been just unbelievable
And in the way in which she has held adults accountable
and it has created this wonderful movement
I've met so many young people
many of whom have worked in one fashion or another with me
in the last few years
who were brought to it from Fridays for the Future
from the Sunrise Movement or you know
it's all that focused youthful idealism and energy
and it demands to be heard
And I think all of us I mean
we should be ashamed of ourselves
that we have to have people who were then  or 
not going to school to get our attention
I mean what the hell is the matter with adult leadership
That's not leadership at all
So I salute her and all the young people who put themselves on the line
But I invite them you know it's not enough
You've got to then 
and I said this during the course of the election
where I hope we created a lot of new voters
And I think environment specifically climate crisis
became a real voting issue this year
just as it was back in  when we created the EPA
and the Clean Air Act and a host of things
And it proves that that kind of activism is necessary
And I hope we're going to keep young people at the table here
and finish the job that's the key now
AG Yeah I couldn't agree more
And another big movement that's having an impact
is the environmental justice movement
You referred to it earlier
And I'm so glad that President Biden is putting environmental justice
at the heart of his climate agenda
It might be good if I could ask you to just take a moment
and tell people why that is such an important part of this issue
JK Well I think it's important part of this issue for many reasons
the most basic is just moral you know what is morally right
And how do you redress a wrong
that has for too many years held people back
killed people by virtue of disease or other things
and resulted in a basic inequality and unfairness in society
And I think you share a feeling as I do Al
that the fabric of a nation
is built around certain organizational principles
And if you're holding yourselves out as a nation to be one thing
ie equal opportunity and fairness
and all people created equal
and equal rights and so forth
if that's what you hold out there and it isn't there
eventually you get such a cynicism
and such a backlash built up into your society
that it doesn't hold together
To some degree that is what we're seeing around the world today
is this nationalistic populism
that is driven by this heightened inequality
that has come through globalization
that has mostly enriched already fairly welloff folks
And so if it's the upper one percent that's getting all the benefits
and the rest of the world struggling to survive and they also have COVID
and then you tell them we've got to do this or that in terms of climate
you're walking on very thin ice
in terms of that sacred relationship between government
and the people who are governed
It's not just an American phenomenon
You see it in Europe
You see it in alternative movements in various countries
And I think it is the great task of our generation
not only to deal with climate
but to restore a sense of fairness
to our economies to our societies
to our world
And that is part of this battle I think
AG Yeah I agree
And another common source of opposition
to what governments are doing now has to do with the fear
both in the US and elsewhere on the part of some
that jobs might be lost in this transition toward a green economy
You and I both know
that there are a lot of jobs that can be created
But let me put the question to you
How can we approach this green transition in a way that lifts everyone up
JK That is one of the most important things that we need to do Al
And we can't lie to people
We can't say that some of the dislocation
doesn't mean that a job that exists today might not be the same job in the future
and that that person has to go through a process of getting there
And we need to make certain that nobody's abandoned
We need to make certain that there are real mechanisms in place
to help folks be able to transition
And I just spoke the other day with Richie Trumka
the head of the American Federation of Labor
and he's been very focused on this
And we agreed to try to work through
how do we integrate that into this transitional process
so that we're guaranteeing that you don't abandon people
Now one of the things we need to do is go to the places
where there have been changes and there will be change
Southeastern Ohio Kentucky West Virginia
You know if the marketplace is making the decision and it's 
by the way it's not government policy
it is the marketplace that has decided in America at least
not to be building a new coalfired plant
So where does that miner
or where does that person who worked in that supply chain go
We have to make sure that the new companies
that the new jobs are actually going into those communities
that the coal community
the coal country as we call it in America
is actually being immediately and directly
and realistically addressed in this
to make sure that people are not abandoned and left behind
That is possible That is doable
Historically unfortunately
there have been too many words and not enough actual 
not enough actually implementation and process
I think that can change
And I'm going to do everything possible in my ability
to make sure that we do change it
AG Well that's great
And another part of the context
within which you are taking on this enormous challenge
is the COVID pandemic
which has exposed the cost of ignoring preexisting systemic risks
inequalities and sustainability
And now as we start to come out of this pandemic
how can we avoid sleepwalking back into old habits
JK Boy that's probably the toughest of all
I mean there's a natural proclivity for people sometimes
to just choose the easiest way
And clearly some people already have and will resort to that
I think the key will be in President Biden's proposal
for the build back
which will actually fight hard to direct funds to the investments
and to the sectors where we want to see a responsible build back
Theres another aspect and I think that can be done Al
I really feel that
For instance
someone who's making a car today in South Carolina
where BMW has plants
and just to pick one place or Detroit
GM is obviously going to make this shift
they just announced it
The people building the car today
are still going to have to put wheels on a car build the car
put the seats in do everything else
It's just that instead of an internal combustion engine
they can be quickly trained to be able to put the platform in for the batteries
and the engines themselves etc that will drive the car the motors
that's one way of dealing
Others are that there's new work in some ways
We have to lay transmission lines in America
We do not have a grid in the United States as you know
We have at east coast west coast
Texas has its own grid north part of America
but there's a huge hole in the country
You can't send energy efficiently from one place to another
We could lower prices for people and create more jobs
in the buildout of all of that kind of new infrastructure
Not to mention the things that you and I you know
there are going to be things that we can't name today
some negativeemissions technology
that's going to grab CO out of the atmosphere
and do something with it
like in Iceland where they put it into the rock
mix it with liquid and it turns into stone
I mean there are all kinds of different things people are exploring
Those are new jobs
AG I just want to say
since we've come to the end of our time for this conversation
thank you again for taking on this crucial challenge
on behalf of the United States of America
and enabling the US to restore its traditional role
in trying to bring the world together
And I know that everybody watching and listening to this conversation
sends you their best wishes and hopes
for all the success possible in this new work John
Thank you so much for joining TED Countdown
and we wish you the very best
JK Can I reciprocate for a minute
First of all I want to thank you
for your extraordinary leadership for years
I can remember when you were leading us in the Senate on this
and you've done so much since
And I am personally delighted to be working with you on this again
and look forward to the next months and together with a lot of other folks
Let's get this done

I often have this strange thought
that aliens come down to Earth to check us out
They beam up a hundred scientists and they ask them
What's going on on your planet
And the aliens quickly learn something
that all of these scientists have concluded
that pollution from our industrial activity is irreversibly heating the earth
in a way that will make it very hard for us to live here safely
Then they do the same thing
but this time they beam up another  people
and they're not scientists they're regular people like us
They could count on one hand
how many of those people would even mention climate change
Two or three dozen of them may never have even heard the term
And among the Americans in the group
only one in four would be highly concerned about the issue
The aliens I think would be shocked
Why don't people know what's happening or how bad it is
Someone should tell them
The absurdity of the situation is so clear and so real
What we have here is a failure to communicate
My job is to educate people about climate change
So I look at the concepts the messages the images and the terms
and I test them with millions of people
I'd like to tell you what I'm learning
For so many people
climate change seems abstract distant too big to imagine
The words we often use to describe it 
emissions CO methane net zero anthropogenic 
are simply put confusing
Not that many people wake up in the morning and say
It's a great day for some decarbonisation
These words become obstacles rather than gateways to understanding
let alone caring
The way to fix this failure to communicate
is to start not by talking about the issue
but to start with people to think first about individuals
the people who have millions of other things on their mind
a million worries and challenges and hopes and aspirations
Climate change is one of the biggest threats humanity has ever faced
and we won't face it
not to the degree that's necessary
if people don't care
The peoplefirst approach to climate communications
demands three simple things
The first one is plain obvious and universal language
One thing for sure people don't readily get 
carbon emissions net zero 
are most terms that can be found in a science book
And frankly to the uninitiated much of it doesn't really sound that bad
Two degrees warmer in  years
or it sounds so bad you can't even get your head around it 
 trillion tons of ice
Confusion and hopelessness are the enemies of understanding
A good test for language is what pops into your head when you hear it
If you hear a term like climate change what pops into your head
Well for most people the answer is not much
The language isn't vivid
What we need is vivid language that everyone gets
It's remarkable how many people actually confuse climate change
with the ozone hole
More than four in  Americans
think the ozone hole actually causes global warming
And so many of them remember and understand
so much about ozone depletion
Why is that
Because it's a hole it's a layer
People can see it imagine it relate to it
It uses simple metaphor that's an instant get
Here's a little story that gets a similar aha
for climate change
Humans have been on Earth for about  years
but we've only started polluting like this in about the last 
Our pollution stays in the air for thousands of years
creating a thickening blanket that traps heat in the atmosphere
That heat causes stronger hurricanes
bigger fires more frequent floods
and the extinction of thousands of species
But there's good news
To stop the pollution blanket
we just have to stop polluting
This pollution blanket framing is one of the most effective we've tested
at getting people to understand the issue
It's visual it's vivid
and when people hear the message they become significantly more engaged
They get it
There are so many other regular speak words and concepts
that stick with people
Instead of warming
try overheating
Instead of climate talk about extreme weather
When mentioning clean energy
you might say cheap energy as well as it's rapidly becoming cheap
The word irreversible really gets people's attention
as the pollution certainly is
And if you absolutely must talk about temperature increases
and you live in the US
heck use Fahrenheit for goodness sake
It doubles the severity
Nine degrees during your kid's lifetime sounds pretty serious
One point five degrees Celsius to meet the Paris Accord is pretty ignorable
This is about going beyond arcane policy language
into language that we all intuitively get
That's the first step understanding
But understanding without relevance is rudderless
So the second key then
is to make climate feel like something that matters to you
to your life individually and personally
Nobody has an epiphany about policy proposals
Awakenings are personal
They have local relevance
They're about your life and your concerns
As an example we presented two messages to a few thousand people in Florida
One asked them to demand that we get to zero emissions to stop climate change
Another simply said Stop my flooding
The latter message was over four times more effective in getting their attention
Local flooding was so much more relevant than global warming
What's needed isn't better policy descriptions
but rather deeper more personal connections
Here's another example
We work with a team of remarkable women climate scientists
to help elevate their voice as messengers
They've dedicated their careers to studying the issue
developing complex computational models to understand the Arctic processes
and climbing into planes to measure nitrogen in wildfire smoke
They could tell you everything you need to know about the science
but what we asked them about was why they study it
And they told us about their daughters and their sons
about wanting to keep the world safe and healthy and vibrant
for their children
And when we shared these personal stories with other parents
they started to care far more deeply about climate change
than they did from staring at charts of global temperatures
People see a parent who's dedicated their life
to creating a better world for their child
Every parent can relate to that
It matters to me
The right messages are those that connect climate change to personal identity
Our life  not future lives
not the world  our community
not necessarily environmentalism  our values
and not just children  our child
Finally the third key to the climate communications puzzle
to show that climate change is an issue for people like me
Humans are social animals
and that's true for how we form our beliefs too
You can present the exact same message to many people
but when it comes from someone with a similar accent or background
we see doubledigit increases in message effectiveness
Here's an unexpected messenger who really lands the point
A guy we call Florida man
He's a resident of North Florida who got into a little trouble with the law
after taking an alligator into a convenience store
when he was on a beer run
Not exactly the most obvious climate change messenger
yet when he appeared in an internet ad describing in his own way
how he's worried about his way of life
it significantly increased climate concern among young conservative men in Florida
Most people don't see themselves as environmentalists per se
and they see climate change as an environmentalist issue
But messages that break away from those narrow identity markers
make the issue relatable
They give people a reason to care
So the core idea is that instead of explaining the issue at people
it's essential to bring people into the issue
so that they say I get it
It matters to me
It matters to people like me
Then and only then are we primed to take action
If the intelligent aliens in my story were also intelligent at communications
they would say to us Hey Earthlings pay attention
you're building up a massive blanket of pollution that's overheating your home
And it's going to hurt the people and the things that you love
You did this and you can fix it
We simply have to let our fellow eight billion inhabitants of our home know
what's happening
We have no choice
And when we do
we'll achieve the public will necessary to take on this colossal
but winnable fight for our future
Thank you

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
We are at the beginning of a new era for the future exploration
and commercialization of space
First it will be the Moon and from there Mars and the rest of the solar system
I've always been fascinated by space exploration
but at the same time troubled by its multiple implications
Historically human exploration has led
to an aggressive exploitation of people land and resources
This ongoing colonization process
has shaped the unfair world we live in today
So how can we make sure
we stop perpetuating the same old colonial patterns
When I was appointed artist in residence at the European Space Agency
I thought it was a unique opportunity to make a bold statement to rethink
as human beings what do we really need to take with us on this space journey
And perhaps even more importantly
what should we leave behind
As a privileged white male individual born and raised in Europe
I grew up in a world where Western arts science and technology
are presumed superior over every other form of knowledge
However visiting many museums
and their vast collections products of our colonial heritage
I was introduced to a wide range of cultures
and unique ways to understand the world we live in
Humanity's greatest achievement was not landing on the Moon
but our cultural diversity
the rituals beliefs and knowledge woven within it
This rich legacy does not belong in the past
but is very much alive
sometimes even thriving
We rarely talk about cultural
ethical or even spiritual matters
when discussing space exploration
but I believe it's precisely culture that will give us a purpose in the future
Through my artistic practice
learning to appreciate multiple cultural dimensions
without the nostalgia or condescension
that historically has been projected upon these cultures
their knowledge and their significance
This is Kim KeumHwa
Korea's most iconic shaman who passed last year
I met Kim KeumHwa at her shrine in Ganghwa Island
where I witnessed her last ritual
a celebration to bless her th anniversary as a shaman
and to prepare her departure to the spirit world
Dating back to prehistoric times
Korean shamanism has remained a resilient form of spiritual practice
and a source of empowerment for many women
This is Jeong Soondeok the shaman of the people
during a ceremony that lasted several days and nights
I remember bowing to her
surrounded by blades and colorful costumes and offerings
Everyday objects were being elevated
acquiring a new dimension right in front of my eyes
I saw her becoming a god
her body transformed through dance prayer and ritual
What's interesting is that despite their position of power
Korean shamans remain graceful humble human beings
Through these women
I could clearly see the power within ancient forms of knowledge
The role our cultures play in maintaining a fragile cosmic balance
This is Don Ramn
a local healer from the Center for Indigenous Arts in Veracruz Mexico
where Totonac culture is being taught to future generations
The center's director Humberto Garca was proud
describing an educational model
where disciplines like art communication or medicine
are not independent but entangled with each other
Totonac cosmovision revolves around this everchanging
interconnected dimension
There is a natural rhythm that infuses every activity here
be it cooking or weaving or healing
Nothing is trivial or decorative
Every gesture every action has a meaning
These traditions beliefs and rituals they're far from being immobile
They're the result of thousands of years of practice
in a painful regenerative process
These are unique pieces of wisdom
we must definitely bring with us into the future
And this is what I'm doing to make that happen
I want to challenge our current model of space colonization
and I decided to start with a big gesture 
to recognize the Moon
as a universal symbol of rebirth and renewal
As part of the European Space Agency's plans
to support a permanent human presence on the Moon
I'm proposing to build the Moon Temple
a future space for diverse cultural projections
traditions and scientific research
The Moon Temple will stand on the rim of the Shackleton crater
a gigantic impact crater featuring peaks of eternal light and perpetual darkness
Its design takes advantage of lunar microgravity
the use of local resources
and the complex celestial mechanics
that operate on the south pole of the moon
Sheltered in its interior
we can find traces from an intriguing new material culture
a series of objects made with moon dust and rare aerospace materials
symbolizing humanity's ancestral wisdom and all its complexity
These masks vessels and other ritual artifacts
they're powerful objects that imply deep personal transformations
sometimes even becoming a bridge to distant worlds
They represent the vast diversity embedded in the human experience
These objects carry within them thousands of stories yet to be written
Some provide protection
while others relate to the harsh conditions
that people will endure outside our planet
But even if these objects come from a place far away from here
we can still recognise a familiar human quality within them
The Moon Temple celebrates the Moon as the measure of all things
It is a monument to humanity's reason and imagination
It represents our chance
to bring together once again science art and ritual
This may be a personal
even utopian vision for our interplanetary future
but perhaps through these utopian exercises
we can break free from many of our prejudices here on Earth
because we need more diverse personal narratives for our future
a future where we don't turn our backs to our cultures
and the role they play in shaping who we are today
A future that does not perpetuate the survival of the most privileged
at the expense of the most vulnerable
but instead acknowledges our fragile position in this universe
and our responsibilities towards it

[How to Deal with Difficult Feelings]
[What's the difference between shame and guilt]
These are emotions that we often use interchangeably
but it turns out they're quite different
So when people feel shame they feel bad about themselves
I'm a bad person for having done this
When people feel guilt they feel bad not about the self
but about a specific behavior I did a bad thing
And it's a subtle distinction
but it turns out that it leads to very different motivations
So when people feel shame about Who I am because I did a bad thing
I'm a horrible person
there's a sense of shrinking and being small
a sense of worthlessness and powerlessness
And when people feel shame they want to hide
They want to sink into the floor
and disappear
They minimize
They often blame other people
But what they don't do typically is try to make things better
When people feel guilt about a specific behavior 
I feel bad that I did that 
they're focused on the behavior and the effects on other people
and that seems to push people in a much more constructive direction
People who feel guilt about a behavior without feeling shame about the self
are more inclined to confess apologize
in some way try to repair the harm that was done
[Whats an example of how guilt can lead a person
to make a positive change]
You know if you really have been responsible
responsibly hurt somebody else's feelings
it's your fault
And to think about that and think about the effect on the other person
I think apologizing reconnecting with that person in some way
repairing the harm that was done
And I want to make a distinction between that
and situations where people feel guilt unwarranted guilt unfair guilt
There are times when we feel guilty over things
that we're not responsible for
And that's a different issue that is potentially problematic
because it's hard to fix something that you're really not responsible for
It leaves you in a tough spot
and it's unfair
So I'm thinking of things like survivor guilt
or people who are in the position
where they think they're responsible for a loved one's addiction
for example
No that's not your responsibility
and not to feel guilt about that
and to really check Is this my responsibility
Then I think in those cases
we have to kind of doublecheck and say
Really am I responsible Is this fair
How would I advise a close friend who were in a similar situation
No that's not your responsibility
There's not a good reason for feeling that guilt and it's not helpful
[How can you support someone who's struggling with shame]
I think if it's an ongoing sort of issue
that therapy is certainly an option
and I think there are many therapists who work with that
and help people move away from problematic feelings of shame
to being more selfcompassionate
and more realistic about what our responsibilities are
It could be a wise person that you trust
One of the things about shame is when we talk about it
it tends to dispel it a little bit
make it easier to deal with if you put it into words
We often don't talk about shame at all
It's sort  of we're almost a shamephobic society I think
I can't remember the last time a client came to me and said I feel shame
We don't use that word
I think it's so hard to manage it and get out of it
and sometimes we feel shame over things that we have done
and then there's this other set of things that we feel ashamed of
which is who we are
So there's a really unfair shame
shame over having a stigmatized identity and internalizing that shame
for example
So people who are you know
in one minority group or another that's stigmatized
part of the issue is Do you buy into that
Do you buy into that and I think that's a really big question to work with
[What strategies can help people change their shame into guilt and move on]
I think that just knowing the difference between the two
is sometimes an aha experience for people
if you can identify when you feel shame and sort of
do some doublechecking you know
Is it really fair for me to feel like a bad person
because I lost my temper with my kids today
Does that mean I'm a horrible parent
Or am I generally a good parent
but this was a bad day
and I did a bad thing and let me address that
and make amends
reconnect with my child
and think about ways to avoid that going forward
as opposed to getting mired in shame shame shame
I think shame is such a selfish emotion
It's all about me
It's not about the person that I hurt
It's Me me me me I'm a horrible person
which takes the focus off of the person you've harmed
[How do you keep yourself from buying into feelings of internalized shame]
Oh yes  buying into internalized shame that's a really good question
I think first of all finding a good supportive group
and also finding ways to celebrate
and to appreciate
the strengths and the beauties of one's group
even if it's stigmatized by the community
I work with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people
And that is one stigmatized group let me tell you
But one way to think about it is you know
I have come through a rough time
and I have in spite of so many barriers stuck with it
and to get support from other people who have made that transition
[How can you deal with shame that you feel
for not measuring up to expectations]
Yes I guess it depends whose expectations you're thinking of
If it's our own expectations
maybe they weren't realistic
or maybe we expected too much
I think that in this world now which moves so fast
I mean  everybody's overloaded
There's something wrong there
About measuring up to other people's expectation
that's a really really important one
and I think it's critical to separate out
what other people's expectations are of you
and what your own expectations are
what your own values are
And we care about
what loved ones and other people think about us
but ultimately
we want to be true to our own values
and be sensitive to others who may have different feelings
different ideas
Explain to the other person You know you expect me to do X
I understand that you'd like me to do that
but I'm doing Y and this is why
It's really important to me
[How to Deal with Difficult Feelings]

Welcome to It Hurts
One of these creatures is thought  to possess
the worlds most painful insect sting
If you were to guess would it be
the ant that forages  in rainforest canopies
The bee that protects a hive of delectable honey
Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas
Lets find out
Ant bee and wasp venoms contain  a variable cocktail of compounds
designed to incite unsavory sensations  and even compromise bodily functions
Entomologist Justin O Schmidts  sting pain index
describes and ranks the pain  of around  kinds of insect stings
One of our three competitors claims the nastiest one
First lets consider  the Western honeybees sting
Schmidt says its like a flaming  match head has landed on your arm
and is quenched first with lye  and then sulfuric acid
This discomfort is accomplished with venom
thats packed with a paincausing  peptide called melittin
and fleshsoftening enzymes that disperse the venom
These enzymes may also cause  allergic reactions
and even lead to fluid buildup  in the lungs
Because worker honeybees have barbed  stingers that burrow into certain victims
they usually can't sting without leaving part of their bodies behind
which ultimately kills them
Since only the queen bee has  the ability to reproduce
a worker bees selfsacrifice helps  ensure that the colony and their genes
will prevail
But before they go
they release an alarm pheromone that activates a mass attack
and often targets some of the most  vulnerable sites on their victims body
The tarantula hawk wasp sting is  as Schmidt says
blinding fierce shockingly electric  A bolt out of the heavens
Lie down and scream
The sensation might last just  agonizing minutes for humans
but it leaves tarantulas the wasps preferred target permanently paralyzed
After the wasp stings a tarantula  aiming for a crucial bundle of nerves
it lays an egg on the immobilized spider
Once hatched the wasps larva spends its formative days
in the bountiful environment  of the tarantulas body
devouring it alive
Aside from paralyzing the tarantula
the wasps sting doesnt seem to do further harm
This functions to preserve the spider  as fresh meat for the wasps offspring
The rainforestdwelling bullet ants sting yields
pure intense brilliant pain
Like walking over a flaming bed  of charcoal
with a inch nail embedded  in your heel according to Schmidt
And this torture often lasts more than  hours
A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin
that our bodies struggle to degrade  is what makes the pain last so long
In addition to agony poneratoxin can  induce trembling cold sweats
nausea vomiting  and even an abnormal heartbeat
The bullet ant is in fact crowned  with the most painful insect sting
It's thought that they may have evolved such an excruciating defense
because they forage in rainforest canopies loaded with predators
looking for proteinaceous snacks
They cant simply jump or fly away
so perhaps theyre better off with this reliable rather offputting weapon
The tarantula hawk wasps formidable sting
clocks in as the second most painful  on the scale
And its likely the reason this wasp  has no known predators
Honeybee stings are in the middle  of the pain scale
But when many sting simultaneously
what mightve felt manageable at first becomes all the more dangerous
In fact insect stings helped enable the evolution of complex colonies
that would otherwise represent an easy feast to predators
Some stinging insects are of course more aggressive than others
but most of the time they only sting us  when we provoke them
The truth hurts

I'm Kalika Bali I'm a linguist by training
and a technologist by profession
I have worked in academia
in startups in small companies and multinationals for over two decades
doing research in and building language technology systems
My dream is to see technology work across the language barrier
As a researcher at Microsoft Research Labs India
I work in the field of language technology and speech technology
And I worry about how can we make technology accessible
to people across the board
you know irrespective of the language that they speak
So natural language processing
artificial intelligence speech technology
these are very big words they are buzzwords right now
Everybody is talking about what exactly is NLP or natural language processing
So in very simple terms
this is the part of computer science engineering
that makes machines process
understand and generate natural language
which is the language that humans speak
When you are interacting with a bot trying to book your train tickets
or flight tickets
when you are speaking to a voicebased digital assistant in your phone
it's natural language processing
that underpins the entire technology that makes that work
But how does this work
How does NLP work
In a very very basic way
it's about data
So a huge amount of data of how actually humans use language
is then processed by certain algorithms and techniques
that make the machines learn the patterns
of natural language of humans right
These days another buzzword that you hear a lot about is deep neural networks
And these are the advanced techniques
that underpin a lot of the NLP stuff that happens right now
And I will not go into the details of how that works
but the thing that you really have to understand and keep in mind
is that all of this requires a humungous amount of data
natural language data
If you want a speech system to converse with you in Gujarati
the first thing you require
is a lot of data of Gujarati people speaking to each other
in their own language
So  Microsoft came up with a speech recognition system
which was able to transcribe speech into text
better than a human did
And this system was trained
on  million transcribed words
In  an EnglishChinese machine translation system
was able to translate from English to Chinese
as well as any human bilingual could
And this was trained on  million bilingual sentence pairs
This is a very very exciting time in natural language processing
and in technology as such
You know we are seeing science fiction which we had read about and watched
kind of come true in front of our own eyes
We are making giant leaps in technical advancement
But these giant leaps are limited to very few languages
So Monojit Choudhury
who's like a very good friend of mine
and a colleague
he has studied this in some detail
and he has looked at resource distribution across languages in the world
And he says that these follow what is called a powerlaw distribution
which essentially means that there are four languages
Arabic Chinese English and Spanish
which have the maximum amount of resources available
There are another handful of languages which can also benefit from you know
the resources and the technology that's available right now
But there are  percent of the world's languages
which have no resources
or very little resources available
This revolution that we are talking about
has essentially bypassed  languages of the world
Now what this means is that resourcerich languages
have technologies built for them
so researchers and technologists get attracted towards them
They build more technologies for them They create more resources
So it's like a rich getting richer kind of a cycle
And the resourcepoor languages stay poor
there's no technology for them nobody works for them
And this divide digital divide between languages
is everexpanding
and by implication also the divide between the communities
that speak these languages is expanding
So in Microsoft in Project Ellora we aim to bridge this gap
We are trying to see how can we create more data by innovative methods
have more techniques to build technology without having a lot of resources
and what are the applications that can truly benefit these communities
So at the moment this might seem very theoretical
like what is he talking about data and techniques and technology
So let me give you a very concrete example here
I'm a linguist at heart I love languages and that's what I love talking about
So let me tell you about a language that many of you might not know about
Gondi
Gondi is a SouthCentral Dravidian language
It is spoken by three million people in five states of India
And to put this in some kind of perspective
Norwegian is spoken by five million people
and Welsh by a little under a million
So Gondi is actually a pretty robust and pretty large community
of the Gond tribals in India
But by UNESCO's Atlas of Languages in Danger
Gondi is designated vulnerable status
CGNet Swara is an NGO that provides a citizen journalism portal
for the Gond community
by making local stories accessible through mobile phones
There's absolutely no tech support for Gondi
There is no data available for Gondi no resources available for Gondi
So all content that is created moderated and edited is done manually
Now under Project Ellora
what we did was that we brought together all the stakeholders
an NGOs like CGNet Swara
and academic institutions like IIIT Naya Raipur
a notforprofit children's book publisher
like Pratham Books
and most importantly the speakers of the community
The Gond tribals themselves participated in this activity
and for the first time edited and translated childrens books in Gondi
We were able to put out  books for the very first time in Gondi
so that the children had access to stories and books in their own language
Another extension of this was Adivasi Radio
which was like an app that we built and developed in Microsoft Research
and then put out there along with our stakeholders
which takes a Hindi texttospeech system
and allows it to read out news and articles provided by CGNet Swara
in Gondi language
Users can now use this app to read
watch news and access any information
through text and voice in their own language
A very interesting thing is that this app is now being used to translate 
by the community to translate text from Hindi to Gondi
Now what that will result in is a lot of parallel data
that we call parallel data
that will allow us to build machine translation systems for Gondi
which will truly open up a window for the Gond community to the world
And what is even more important is now we know how to do this
We have the entire pipeline and we can replicate this for any language
and any language community
which is in a similar situation as the Gond tribals
Also education  yes you know information access  yes
but what about earning a living
Right What about  how can we make these people earn a living
through the digital tools that all of us just take for granted these days
Vivek Seshadri who's another researcher at MSR
and his collaborator Manu Chopra
they've designed a platform called Karya
for providing digital microtasks to the underserved communities
His aim was basically to find a way to provide a means of dignified labor
to the populations the rural populations
and the urban poor populations of this country
They don't have access to all the knowledge
to use the digital platforms
that all of us use every day without even thinking right
But 
Here is a large
literate population that wants to work right
and how can we make this possible for them
So Karya is one such way
through which this population can get on to the digital world
and you know
through that find work and do tasks that can then earn them money
So we saw this and we thought oh this is wonderful
We could probably use this for data collection as well
So we went to Amale
which is a small village of  people
in the Wada district of Maharashtra
and decided to use Karya to collect Marathi data
Now I know what you are thinking 
I'm sure a lot of Marathi speakers also in the audience 
that Marathi is not a lowresource language
Marathi is definitely a mainstream language of the country
But as far as language technology is concerned
Marathi is a lowresource language
So we went to this village
and we had a very successful datacollection trip
And you know this village is very remote
They have no TV they have no electricity
they have no mobile signal
You have to climb a hill and wave your phone around
if you want to you know use your mobile to call anyone
So they gave us all this data
But more than that they gave us very valuable lessons in life
One is this pride in one's own language
The people of Amale were thrilled to be doing this
because they were advancing their own language by doing this
The second was the value of community
Very quickly this became a village community effort
People would gather together in tasks and do this together as a group
And the third is the importance of storytelling
People of Amale were so starved of content that in the morning during the daytime
they would do recordings of stories in Karya
and then in the evening they would gather the entire village
and retell and recount these stories to the village
So as scientists we get so caught up
in the science and technology part of what we are doing you know 
which is the next best model to have
how can we increase the accuracy of my system
how can I build the next best system there is 
that we forget the reason why we are doing this the people
And any successful technology is the one that keeps the people and the users
up front and center
And when they start doing that
we also realize that technology is probably a very small part of this
and there are other things in the story
Maybe there are social cultural and policy interventions
that are required as much as technology
So some time back I worked on a project called VideoKheti
that allowed Hindispeaking farmers in Central India
to search for agricultural videos by speaking into a phonebased app
So we went to Madhya Pradesh to collect data for this
and we came back and we were training our models
and we discovered we're getting very bad results
This is not working
So we were very confused Why is this happening
So we looked deeper and deeper into the data
and discovered that yes we had collected data
from what we thought was a very silent quiet village in the evening
But what we hadn't heard while we were doing this
was that there was this constant buzz of night insects you know
So throughout the recordings we had this bzz of the insects
which was actually distorting our speech
The second thing was that when we went there
to kind of test our app in the village
I and my colleague Indrani Medhi
who is a very wellregarded design researcher
we found that the women couldn't pronounce the sanskritized words
that we had for some of the search terms
So like 
speaks Hindi
Which is like the term for chemical pesticides right
Because we got these terms from the agricultural extension center
and the women even though they are farming
do not interact with that center at all
The men do the women probably use something much simpler like 
speaks Hindi
Which basically means killing pests with medicine
So what I have learned through my journey
and what I would like to put across to you 
by now I hope you've understood me
is that there is the majority of the world's languages
that require intensive investment for resource creation
if they are to benefit from language technology
And this is unlikely to happen in a very fast and efficient manner
So it is extremely important for us to ensure
that the community derives maximum benefit
from whatever that we are doing in the language tech area
And to do this and deliver a positive social impact
on these communities
we follow what we call the modified D design thinking methodology
So the D means discover design develop and deploy
So discover the problem that language technology can solve
for a particular language community
This observationled approach can help allocate resources
where they are most needed
designed for the users and their language
understand the diversity in the linguistic properties
and the languages of the world
And don't think oh this is made for English
Now how can we just adapt it for Marathi or for Gondi right
Develop rapidly and deploy frequently
It's an iterative process that will help you fail fast
and early failures will eventually lead to success
The important thing is to persevere
Do not give up
And I remember the story of these two Aborigine Australian women
Patricia O'Connor and Ysola Best
In the mids they went to the University of Queensland
and they wanted to learn their own language called Yugambeh
and they were told very bluntly Your language is dead
It's been dead for three decades
You cannot work on this Find something else to work on
They did not give up
They went to the community
they dug up oral memories oral traditions oral literature
and founded the Yugambeh Museum
which became the most important cultural and linguistic center for the language
and its community
They did not have technology They only had their willpower
Now with the power of technology
we can ensure that the next page is written in Salmi from Finland
Lillooet from Canada or Mundari from India

Thank you

First a warning
As far as offensive words go you are now entering a hardhat area
We're going to be unabashed in this
I am talking to you about a very particular word
a very powerful word
a very see you next Tuesday word
A word that is still so offensive
that the funders of this event would only let me talk about it
if we censored it on the slides
Laughter
which rather proves my point don't you think
I love this word
Oh my God I love everything about this word
not just what it signifies
but the actual sound of it
the fact that the C and the T just cushion that nnn sound
into this monosyllabic
that you can just spit like a bullet
or you can extend it out and roll it round your mouth
cuuunt
I love its dexterity
I love the fact that in Scotland its a term of endearment
but in America it's horrendously offensive
I love it means something different with your friends
than it does if you said it to your boss
it would probably cost you your job
I do not recommend it
I love this word
Laughter
I love the fact that the first three letters
are still the same chalice shape
all rolling through the word until they're stopped in that plosive T
at the end
I think the thing that I love most about it
is its status as the nastiest of all the nasty words
Although that title is under some contention now
There are other obvious heavyweight contenders
for the most offensive word
The Nword for example
But here's what I would say to you
I know why that word is offensive
I can look at the history
that word enabled the brutalization and racial genocide
of an entire group of people
It played its part in dehumanizing Black people
What did cunt do
Laughter
Does it not strike anyone else as odd
that a word that just means the vulva
could even be regarded in the same league of offense
as the Nword
Are we saying that vulvas are that offensive
Surely not
But what I want to talk to you today about is how did we get here
Has it always been this offensive
and how did it come to be so
The answer is no it was not
But let's look at the history of it first of all
Where in the cunt does cunt come from
Laughter
It's one of those words that's so old
etymologists and linguists they lose sight of it eventually
It's the oldest word for the vulva that we have in the English language
It might even be the oldest in the world
There are some theories
There are also similar cognitions in Germanic languages all across Europe
The Vikings would be talking about kuntas
the Germans had kunt
Dutch kont Germanic kott
and I think at one point we had kott
which I think may be due for a revival
After that it gets a bit confusing as to what this word actually means
One of the leading theories is that it shares this root
this ProtoIndoEuropean root with this gen sound
which you also see in genetics gene
and that means to create
Another theory is that it comes from this sound gune
which gives us woman gynecology
Create woman
But what really fascinates linguists is this sound the cuu sound
because that gave us cunt also it gave us cunning
Cunning originally didn't mean sneaky
It meant you knew something
Cunning folk cunning women were wise women
And in Scotland still today if you can something
it means you know something
I ken this
It also gave us queen and cow
slightly bizarre which is slightly less highbrow but 
It turns up again in the Middle Ages in quaint
which means knowledge and also means cunt
It has a Latin variation as well
cunnis which also means cunt
which turns up all over the Roman world
including in graffiti in Pompeii
Some of my favorite Roman graffiti from the city of Pompeii
I won't try and do the Latin but it's translated to be
A hairy cunt is better fucked than a smooth one
Laughter
It wants cock and holds in steam
Laughter
There you go
However I put it to you that the word cunt
as offensive as it may be today
stems from a root that means woman knowledge
create cow
Has it always been this offensive
No
But we'll talk about this
So when we talk about these words vulva vagina
trying to offer more palatable alternatives to cunt
vagina the word turns up in the th century
It's taken directly from Latin and it means a scabbard
It means something that a sword goes into
Vulva doesn't do much better
That appears in the th century and it means womb
but some people suggest it comes from the French and means wrapper
Both these words derive their meaning and their import
from the penis basically
That's what a vagina is
It's something a sword goes into
I say that these words aren't as feminist as cunt
which comes from a word that means queen create wisdom cow
But when did it first start being used in English
as we recognize it today
Gropecunte Lane this is the first recorded incident
in the Oxford English Dictionary
it turns up in 
a street name in London called Gropecunte Lane
which was exactly what it sounds like
this was in the redlight district of Southwark
it was a lane for groping cunts
And there wasn't just one in London there was one in Bristol
there was one in York
It appears all over the British Isles
Here it is the one in Bristol
Sorry Oxford there it is just in blue
But whereas Glaswegians might be calling each other and their friends cunts
it seems that medieval people were calling their children cunts
because it turns up in a number of names bizarrely enough
Godwin Clawecunte is recorded in 
Gunoka Cuntles in 
John Fillecunt in 
Robert Clevecunt 
and a Miss Bele Wydecunthe turns up in the Norfolk subsidiary role
We don't know if these are aliases or if they're jokes
but we do have a lot of fun with medieval names
In fact originally the word fuck did not mean what it means today
It means to strike something to hit
which gives us the fabulous name of a dairy farmer in 
whos known as Simon Fuckebotere
Laughter
So was it this offensive to medieval people
No it wasn't
Cunts turn up all over medieval culture and medieval literature
And they are certainly not offensive it's just a descriptive term
Here's some examples
The Proverbs of Hendyng from 
advises women to give your cunt cunningly
and make your demands later
ie get a ring on it first before you give it up
There's a Welsh poet called Gwerful Mechain from the th century
and she advises male poets to celebrate the fine bright curtain
of a cunt that flaps in place of greeting
It might surprise us that medieval culture was this open about cunts
but the truth was they were more sexually liberated
than we actually give them credit for
This idea of them being in a tower with a chastity belt on
is largely a hatchet job on their reputation
done by the Victorians
Now it wasn't a sexually liberated utopia
They had their own hangups
but they weren't that offended by sex
What will get you in trouble swearwords in the Middle Ages
was religious ones blasphemous ones
If you said something like God's wounds or God's teeth
thats what youd say if you caught your soft and danglies in your fly
One medieval poet who dropped the Cbomb with the precision of a military drone
is this chap Geoffrey Chaucer
who turns up in GCSEs and Alevels syllabuses
although his cunt jokes are generally not dwelled upon
He doesn't use the word cunt he uses the word queynte here
which again means knowledge and it means cunt
So this is his joke
As the clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte
And prively he caughte hire by the queynte
A rough translation means the clerk was really cunning
and he caught her by the cunt
Shakespeare
It's been suggestion that he uses that play
a quaint  queynte  cunt
in his Sonnet number 
Here he is
It certainly turns up in a lot of his work
It's a lot ruder than we often give him credit for
In Hamlet
act three scene two Hamlet says to Ophelia he says
Shall I lie in your lap
And she says Oh no my Lord
And then he says Do you think I meant country matters
When David Tennant played that part he paused
Do you think I meant country matters
to try and really drive it home
Another one Twelfth Night
Malvolio says of his mistress's handwriting
There be her Cs her Us her Ts and thus she makes the very great Ps
punning on cunt and piss simultaneously
The immortal Bard's status as a smut peddler
is often swept under the cultural rug
In  Thomas Bowdler published The Family Shakespeare
where he edited out all of these jokes all of the rude bits
and made it a completely cuntfree affair
It's no surprise that about this time
we start to get the first libel laws in Britain
the first banning of seditious and offensive pamphlets
with the rise of Puritanism
For Shakespeare to be veiling his cunt jokes
in kind of cheeky double entendres
suggests that it's not quite as free and open
as Gunoka Cuntles and Gropecunte Lane would once have had
The Puritans repressed sexuality we know this
and language is extremely important battleground for sexual liberation
How do you talk about your bodies
if the very words you're trying to use are considered to be offensive
How do you do that
And by the time we get to the Restoration period
the early modern period cunt is most certainly offensive
And this chap here John Wilmot Earl of Rochester
is the absolute poster boy of fuck you
If the Puritans tried to dam up sexuality
this guy surfed to notoriety on a wave of sexual repression
that was unleashed when the plug was pulled on the Puritan rule
He uses cunt a lot and he's very naughty about it
He wrote this poem about his mistress
and how jealous he was of her other lovers
When your lewd cunt came spewing home
Drenched with the seed of half the town
My dram of sperm was supped up after For the digestive surfeit water
Full gorged at another time
With a vast meal of slime
Which your devouring cunt had drawn
From porters backs and footmens brawn
Sorry everyone
He uses that word to shock
and it's easy to look at his work and think that he's sexually liberated
but he's actually quite angry at cunts and their owners
and that goes all the way through it
From here on out
cunt is an offensive naughty word
Georgian cunts here we go
Laughter
I'll just let that settle
So what happens about the th century is the print industry really explodes
And of course we being humans
we didn't just want to publish nice books
We published porn yay
There's a huge proliferation of porn that comes out of the th century
But oddly enough
most of it shies away from using that word cunt
In  Francis Grose published his book
A Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue
which is basically a dictionary of slang
And he defined cunt as a nasty name for a nasty thing
Such modesty from someone who also uses the word buccaneer's boot
lobster pot skut and Mrs Frubs parlor
for the vulva
This book here
Harris's List this is an almanac
it's a directory of sex workers in London at the time who were selling sex
And it lists not only their address and their prices
but very very intimate descriptions of what they do and their vulvas
But it doesn't use cunt very much
This one here this is an illustration
fabulous illustration from Fanny Hill
what's often called the first pornographic novel
which was published in  by John Cleland
who famously boasted that he did it without writing any rude words at all
These texts tend to use expressions like mossy grot
cupid's coal hole
Venuss mound
but we shy away from cunt
Victorians so despite their reputation for being sexually prudish
pornography flowed underneath Victoria uppercrust society
like a river of slime in Ghostbusters II
They had pornography all over the place
visual and literary
and they had a lot of fun with cunt
One of their pornographic magazines
The Pearl was published from  to 
and it published in it nursery rhymes every month
I've got some here for you to have a look at
There was a young lady of Hitchin
Who was scrotching her cunt  in the kitchen
Her father said Rose Its the crabs I suppose
Youre right pa the buggers are itching
There was a young man of Bombay Who fashioned a cunt out of clay
But the heat of his prick Turned it into a brick
And it chafed all his foreskin away
Laughter
Yeah well done Victorians well done
Interestingly it's also in the th century
that we get the first recorded use of cunt being used as an insult
As an actual You are a cunt
That's the first time that it's used in the th century
In the th century
it started being used as a kind of a derogatory collective noun for women
Samuel Pepys writes about this aphrodisiac
that's going to make all the cunts chase after him
Charming
That's when they weren't stabbing him with pins
for being too sexually aggressive
Anyway the Victorians liked a wellplaced cunt
One of the most important cunt moments in history is this
Is the publication
and the subsequent obscenity trial of Lady Chatterleys Lover
This book contained  cunts and  fucks
and it was banned and it had to go on trial in order to be published
And it was shocking not just because of the graphic scenes of sex
and the language used
but because it smashes down class boundaries
If you're not familiar with this it's about Lady Constance Chatterley
a married woman who embarks on affair with with Sean Bean here
but with Mellors the gamekeeper
And the idea is that it doesn't matter all her heirs and graces and titles
shes got a cunt shes a sexual woman and that levels them
But one of the pivotal scenes is where Mellors tries to tell her
what cunt means
I won't do the accent
Nay nay
Fuck's only what animals do
but cunt's a lot more than that
It's thee dost see there's a lot more beside an animal aren't ter
Even ter fuck
Cunt Eh thats the beauty of thee lass
Cunt That's the beauty of thee lass
I love that
Now despite a jury that agreed
a work stuffed full of cunts does have artistic merit
and they allowed it to be published
and you can see the pictures of the people queuing around the streets
to get their hands on this book once it was
cunt never really made it back into the mainstream
Feminists have maintained a rather uneasy relationship with cunt
This is Judy Chicago
She led what was called The Cunt Art Movement of the s
It first turned up in a film
a mainstream cinema in  in Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson
who screamed at a woman that she is a ballbusting
son of a cunt bitch
or words to that effect
And in The Exorcist as well
It appears in The Vagina Monologues  I think it was
with Eve Ensler when she talks about reclaiming cunt
But it's still not off the linguistic naughty step
despite all of this work
Cunts today
Laughter
It was it was finally admitted to the Oxford English Dictionary
despite having been around for thousands of years
in the 's
And then in  they relented a little bit more
and they added cunty cuntish cunted and cunting
So we all know exactly what that means
The Ofcom
the regulator for UK TV censorship
in  released a poll
of what they regarded to be the most offensive words
and cunt was bang up there
It was on top
It is still regarded as a horrendously offensive word
But here's what I want to leave you with
What do you call yours
Because as far as I can see
words for vulva or cunts fall into a few categories
We've got childlike a tuppence
a Twinkie a foof a minky a Mary
Very medical a vulva pudendum vagina
Slightly detached down there it's down there
Laughter
Bits special area
Violent axe wound penis flytrap gash or a growler
The taxi driver on my way in told me
that Glaswegian slang for cunnilingus is growling at the badger which 
Laughter
I'll leave that with you
Or they just tend to be unpleasant
horrible images of fish and meat and general putrescence
fish taco bacon sandwich
badly stuffed kebab bearded clam etc
Are these better alternatives to cunt
But I think the reason that we're not prepared
and we can't handle cunt
is because we can't handle cunts generally
While it's been linguistically sanitized
culturally the only cunts we seem to be OK with
are the ones that have been plucked
and buffed and waxed and glued and covered in glitter
So vajazzled by the way
The vaginoplasty business is booming
You can have your labia cut off
you can have your hymen rebuilt
you can have your pelvic floor resprung
Are we this uncomfortable with the cunt actually as it is
It's a seat of enormous and awesome power
It can eat a penis and push out a baby
it's not a twinkle
Laughter
It is an old word
It's an offensive word
But it's an ancient and honest one and this is the thing
This is the original word
everything else came after
So welcome to Team Cunt
Applause

One of the hallmarks of living in a technologically advanced society
is even the little details of life that seem mundane
end up being astonishing
like the fact that it takes five gallons of water to produce a walnut
or that half the plastic that's ever been made
has been made in the past  years
My favorite of these examples is what it takes
to keep a room room temperature
Allow me to explain
Heating is generally done by combusting a fossil fuel
So first we have to find the fuel
Unfortunately it tends to be buried
more than a kilometer under the earth's surface
and all too often in inconvenient places
like the Arctic Circle nations in conflict
or under the bottom of the ocean
Then there's the fact that the substance takes  to  million years
to form from dead plankton
So there's that issue
We drill these incredibly deep holes to get it
Then we pipe it truck it
and ship it in tankers across the world to refineries
which are these incredibly expensive industrial facilities
that take in crude oil and gas
which are just a bunch of different hydrocarbon molecules
in order to sort those molecules into refined products
Refined natural gas is then delivered to homes and businesses
via an invisible interstate highway system millions of miles long
It's invisible because it's underground
There's so much pipeline in this system that entire steel mills have been built
only to produce pipeline for this system
And because there are millions of miles of gas
getting pumped beneath us at high pressure at all times
engineers send these intelligent robots called smart pigs
through the pipelines to check for safety defects
Doing this is called pigging the pipeline
Pig snort sound
Yeah that's a real thing
But even with these precautions there are accidents
In  the San Bruno natural gas pipeline exploded in California
Eight people died
Eyewitnesses reported the blast looked like a wall of fire  feet tall
More recently in  excess pressure in natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts
resulted in explosions that killed somebody
and forced  others from their homes
But you know despite all of this
we're actually jealous of people who live close enough to these insane pipelines
to get gas into their homes
because everyone else is stuck with even worse options
like fuel oil and propane
These fuels don't have pipelines in place for delivery
so instead tens of thousands of trucks go from home to home
in neighborhoods throughout the country
pumping these fuels into tanks in homeowners' basements and yards
And regardless of what heating fuel you use  gas propane or oil 
you better have a carbon monoxide detector
so your heating system doesn't accidentally kill you in the night
because hundreds of Americans die in exactly that way each year
So that's the system we have today
Safe to say it has some downsides
Don't get me wrong  it's a marvel of human ingenuity
but with some pretty serious drawbacks
And the rigamarole of conventional heating feels even more over the top
when you consider that every home
is already sitting right on top of a vast reservoir of renewable energy
geothermal energy
Let's talk about geothermal energy
Starting a few feet under the earth's surface
the ground is awash in thermal energy
This is why caves and wine cellars they never get too hot or too cold
They're just bathed in this lowgrade heat
Geothermal heating systems draw on this heat
using what are called ground loops
which are just simple plastic pipes buried under the yard
These ground loops are then connected to a heat pump that sits inside the home
typically where a furnace once was
More and more homeowners are choosing geothermal over fuelbased options
I see this shift up close every day
because I cofounded a company to create a new kind of groundup utility
by making it as easy and inexpensive as possible
to switch from conventional heating to geothermal
We've done this by creating a service
where homeowners can fill out a form on our website
we design a geothermal heating system for them
and then we install that system using purposebuilt tools and equipment
Once the installation is done
that home will have moved on from fossil heating forever
because those ground loops they'll last as long as the home itself
As each home switches over a new kind of utility is taking hold 
a distributed utility
made up of homes exchanging renewable energy with the ground
This new infrastructure is simple local and inexpensive to operate
and it represents a permanent and wholesale shift
away from fossil fuels
The groundwork is being laid so to speak
for the idea that maybe we don't need to destroy the world
in order to keep our rooms at a comfortable temperature
Let's leave the Arctic Circle and the seafloor alone
bypass the refineries and the pipelines
and stop worrying that our families will accidentally be poisoned in the night
Instead let's use the massive amounts of energy
that are already right there for the taking
right beneath every building on earth
Thank you

I love the universe
The vastness the mystery
the astonishing beauty of the stars
I love everything about it
and I've devoted my life to studying it
From atoms to galaxies
from beginning to end
But lately I've gotten stuck on that last bit
The fact that the universe is dying
I know this may come as a shock
I mean it's the universe it's everything
It's supposed to be eternal right
But it isn't
We know the universe had a beginning
and everything that begins ends
The start of the story is a familiar one
In the beginning there was light
We know that because we can see it directly
The cosmos today is filled with lowenergy background radiation
left over from a time
when the whole universe was an allencompassing inferno
In its first  years space wasn't cold or dark
It was thick with a churning humming plasma
It was hot and dense
It was loud
But it was also expanding
Over time the fire dissipated and space cooled
Clouds of gas pulled together by their own gravity
formed stars and galaxies and planets and us
And one day
astronomers using a microwave receiver detected a bit of static
coming from every direction in the sky
the leftover radiation from that primordial fire
We can now map out the cosmos
to the farthest reaches of the observable universe
We can see distant galaxies
whose light has taken billions of years to reach us
So by looking at them we are looking deep into the past
We can watch how the expansion of the universe has slowed down
since that hot early phase  billion years ago
We can see collisions of entire galaxies
and watch the bursts of star formation
that result from the sudden conflagration of all that cosmic hydrogen
And we can see that these collisions are happening less and less
The expansion of the universe isn't slowing down anymore
A few billion years ago it started speeding up
Distant galaxies are getting farther apart
faster and faster
Star formation has slowed
In fact we can calculate exactly how much
And when we do we find something shocking
Of all the stars that have ever been born or that ever will be
around  percent have already come into being
From now until the end of time
the universe is working on just that last  percent
The end of the universe is coming
There are a few ways it could happen
but the most likely is called the heat death
and it's an agonizing slow languishing of the cosmos
Stars burn out and leave smoldering ash
Galaxies become increasingly isolated in their own dim pools of light
Particles decay
Even black holes evaporate into the void
Of course we still have some time
The heat death is so far in the future we hardly have words to describe it
Long past a billion years
when the sun expands and boils off the oceans of the Earth
Long past  billion years
when we lose the ability to see distant galaxies
and that faint trace of Big Bang light
Long after we are left alone in the darkness
watching the Milky Way fade
It's OK to be sad about it
even if it is trillions of years in the future
No one wants to think about something they love coming to an end
As disconnected as it may be to us here and now
it is somehow more profound than personal death
We have strategies for accepting the inevitability of that
After all we tell ourselves something of us will live on
Maybe it will be our great works
Maybe it will be our children carrying on our genetic material
or perhaps our basic outlook on life
Maybe it will be some idea worth spreading
Humanity might venture out into the stars and evolve and change
but something of us will survive
But if the universe ends
at some point we have no legacy
There will come a time when in a very real sense
our existence will not have mattered
The slate will be wiped clean completely
Why should we spend our lives
seeking answers to the ultimate questions of reality
if eventually there will be no one left to tell
Why build a sandcastle when you can see that the tide is coming in
I've asked a dozen other cosmologists
and they all had different answers
To some the death of the cosmos just seems right
It's freeing to know that we are temporary
I very much like our blipness one told me
To others the question itself motivates the search for some alternative theory
There must be some way to carry on
The slow fade to black just cannot be how our story ends
One found comfort in the possibility of the multiverse
It's not all about us he said
Personally I feel lucky
Our cosmos existed for billions of years before us
and it will carry on long after we are gone
For this brief moment we are here
We may be insignificant to the cosmos as a whole
but we have an immense power to understand it
to see the beginning
to contemplate the end
to look up into the sky
and see ourselves reflected in every tiny point of light
There is a kind of luxury in the freedom to look beyond our own little lives
and contemplate the end of everything
We fragile doomed humans
carry within us a sense of discovery and wonder
It will persist as long as there are thinking beings in the cosmos
And we can decide how to use it
Thank you

For decades scientists have tried to use brain modulation
to treat neurological disorders
Techniques usually involved sticking wires onto our head
then helmets that immobilized our head
and zapping our brain with magnetic or electrical pulses
Given what we now know about the millions of circuits that our brain has
this was much like trying to fix a pothole by resurfacing the entire road
Brain modulation can actually come in different forms
The brain connects with all organs in our bodies through neurons
much like an octopus' tentacles
This means that diabetes cancer autoimmune disorders can all be induced
affected and exacerbated by the brain and the nervous system
This also means that brain modulation can be achieved
through different parts of the body
by zapping organs and limbs with electrodes
that have usually been implanted with drills and scalpels
Today however brain modulation doesn't have to be so invasive
Some of my colleagues at MIT
have discovered that a potential therapy for Alzheimer's
could be watching light of a certain wavelength
flash at a particular frequency
This is an example of something I like to call a bionudge 
simple techniques that target specific circuits in our bodies
to achieve a certain outcome
like using light to slow degeneration and Alzheimer's
Let me show you an example of a really simple bionudge
In  seconds I'm going to cause neurons in your pretectal area to light up
and then I'll stimulate your amygdala and hippocampus to surprise you
Finally your arcuate nucleus to make you feel hungry
Bionudges don't need to be shocking or jarring
They just need to be designed to activate or silence a specific brain circuit
Combining bionudges in a certain order
can allow us to use them for a more targeted purpose
My team and I at MIT developed microdevices
similar in shape and size to a pill that can be swallowed like we do pills
and contain electronics
to deliver little bursts of electrical or chemical stimuli 
bionudges  to our gut
Our gut is the largest interface of our body with the outside world
It has an incredible combination of tissues all working together
It houses enteroendocrine cells
that sense what we eat
and induce the release of hormones that can regulate hunger and metabolism
It houses immune cells that sense the microbiome
while preventing bacteria from entering our body
And neurons  lots and lots of neurons
This is why certain sugary or salty foods can ramp up dopamine levels in our brain
and make us feel quite good after eating them
Our electronic pills can be designed to reside in the gut for days to weeks
delivering bionudges to neurons along the GI tract
Depending on the shape and strength of these electrical impulses
they can either affect hormone levels in our blood
or travel up to our brain
where they can activate or silence specific brain circuits
that control hunger metabolism and arousal
Much like we did just a few minutes ago
Using our devices we could stimulate the stomach
to tackle nausea or influence satiety
or the intestine to change the way we digest things like glucose
by affecting absorption of nutrients in food
This could mean new noninvasive therapies for the  million diabetics in the US
and  million obese population worldwide
We could even affect things like inflammation in the brain
slowing down degeneration for the almost  million patients
with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's around the world
By being super specific we can avoid side effects
unlike most of our drugs
And in this way we can control appetite nutrient digestion hormone levels
even happiness and reward
This is exciting
Bionudges are more targeted than medicines and less invasive than surgery
Neuromodulation therapies could be a new gold standard in health care
I'd like to leave you with an image
a single pill not filled with drugs or chemicals
but with electronics and microdevices
that deliver little bursts of energy to our gut
This pill can treat Parkinson's Alzheimer's diabetes or obesity
all without any chronic drugs completely noninvasively
No drill no surgery no hospital stay
This is how medicine could be
This is how medicine should be
Thank you

Simone Ross Good morning Kiran
Kiran MazumdarShaw Hi Simone
SR Thank you so much for joining us here today
How do you think that the challenges of the past year will sort of 
Do you think they will either hinder
or improve equitable access to health care
KMS Well you know Simone one thing is very clear 
that COVID actually pointed out to us that we are all in it together
And I think it also exposed many frailties and fragilities
of the healthcare systems around the world
And you know if I may say so
the developing world showed that it had better primarycare capabilities
than the western hemisphere
And this actually has helped them cope with the disease
I think a little better
than what the Western world has struggled with
And it also pointed out that you know
you cannot be looking after your own small populations
and forget about others who are in the neighborhood
because you're not safe
And I think from that point of view
this is now becoming a collective global effort
when it comes to a postpandemic world a postCOVID world
because we will need to basically cooperate
in terms of surveillance
in terms of prevention and in terms of preparedness
in terms of future pandemics
So I think COVID actually has demonstrated
the importance of equitable health care for all
because if you don't do that
you're not really protecting yourselves against it
And the other point is that of course
we've seen a large number of initiatives under various umbrellas of WHO
or CEPI COVAX the Gates Foundation et cetera et cetera
which really has focused on stockpiling vaccines
for equitable distribution amongst various countries
So I think all these efforts show you
that there is a collective force for global public good
that is gaining a lot of acceptance
SR I think nothing to sort of show you how interconnected we truly are
than a global pandemic
So you know it's pretty amazing
almost unbelievable that a year into this
we have multiple vaccines that are rolling out
And as you sort of mentioned
there has been a fair amount of cooperation
between certainly it seems in the pharmaceutical industry on this
Is there anything that has been surprising about that to you
And I'm curious if you have thoughts
on what governments can actually learn from industry on this
Because as you said global cooperation is really really important
if we're going to get a grip on this pandemic and future pandemics
KMS So you know the way I look at this Simone
is let's look at what actually is happening
and what happened to begin with
So to begin with one of the things that we actually learned was
the fact that small biotechs were the ones who actually delivered
on innovation and innovative vaccines
So whether it was Oxford University
whether it was BioNTech and whether it was Moderna
and many other biotechs like Novavax et cetera
I think they were the ones who actually pivoted very rapidly
and came up with those early vaccine programs
which were then quickly partnered with Big Pharma
So Big Pharma actually then decided to basically invest and license
and develop these programs
and take it to global markets because you know
they felt that it was Big Pharma that had the kind of necessary networks
and supply chains to deliver those vaccines efficiently to global markets
And that's where they got a lot of help from public funding from BARDA and EU
and many other sources of funding including the Gates Foundation
to basically then deliver these programs
to the endmarkets that required these vaccines
So that was one very important learning that we had from this pandemic
The second thing was that after these vaccines were approved
again some gaps in production came about
And so therefore suddenly Big Pharma started partnering with each other
which really hasn't happened before
where say Novartis decided to help out Pfizer
in its manufacturing gaps
And the same thing happened with Merck now trying to help out J an J
with its manufacturing needs
So there's been a lot of interesting partnerships and collaborations
to really address this global challenge
So I think this has been a really good effort
and a great collective effort
Amidst all this
I also wanted to pitch for what the Indian vaccine industry
has done for the world
If you remember in the early stages of the pandemic
we had Indian companies really starting to invest in vaccine development
Our largest vaccine maker Serum Institute
in fact partnered with Oxford University even before AstraZeneca did
And they agreed to help Oxford University
by saying that we will actually manufacture this at risk
so that you can start clinical trials
And then of course
AstraZeneca came into the picture and then you know
Serum Institute is still making very large quantities of the vaccines at scale
and supplying it to COVAX and many other countries
who are shortsupplied in terms of vaccines
Another company Bharat Biotech
also started developing its own homegrown vaccine based on the virus
which was then an inactivated virusbased vaccine
which has also received emergencyuse authorization in India
And then many other companies are also partnering with Novavax and J and J
And there is a quadrilateral alliance summit in India
between the US India Australia and Japan
that is actually talking about partnering
in this whole pandemic crisis
in terms of both surveillance in terms of manufacturing
in terms of vaccine deployment
So I think it's very interesting what's happening in the world
And I think India has finally found recognition
as a major supplier of vaccines
and not just vaccines but the entire supply chain
We are now recognised as the largest producer of vaccines
of syringes of glass vials of needles
because that was our original business
India was vaccinating the world
but it was actually vaccinating low and middleincome countries
for the kind of vaccines that you normally deploy worldwide
to immunize children
Today I think it has pivoted
and it has gotten recognised as a major vaccine producer in the world
So I think it's important for us to recognize
that India is a very critical part of the global supply chain
when it comes to vaccines
and even generic medicines for that matter
SR Many countries in the developing world have actually done very well
in controlling the virus in controlling COVID
and has gotten somewhat better than other parts of the world
Do you think there's something cultural in that
Because the other thing you talked about at Berkeley
was sort of the difference between the pharma industry in India
versus the rest of the world
KMS So you know
there are a number of hypotheses
in terms of why did the developing world manage COVID better
than other parts of the world
especially Asia I would say
And I think the reason is that there are many many factors
One is that we are a young population you know
so I think our demographics have played to our advantage
I think what has also helped us a lot
is that unlike the rigidity of standard of care protocols
in many advanced parts of the world
I think Indian doctors are very ready to experiment with therapies
that can work
Now for instance this is a new virus
This was a new disease
And if you are very stuck on standard of care protocols
which may not work for this disease
then you're actually not giving yourself a fair chance
to deal with the disease in a more optimal way
In India I think we have an excellent medical community
we have great doctors
And these doctors were actually willing to experiment
with anything that could save patients
And what I mean by that is way before WHO prescribed steroids
as one of the important interventions for hyper immune responses
I mean Indian doctors were using steroids right at the start of the disease OK
And then we were trying everything possible in a very logical way
whether it was basically blood thinners
whether it was low molecular weight heparins to prevent clotting
As they learned about how this disease was working
they were willing to use these kind of therapeutics
to try and deal with these patients and their problems
So I think this has helped a lot
SR I'm curious
So you're an entrepreneur
although maybe you don't consider yourself one now
but you did start your company I've read in a garage
which often you hear as part of the startup law
certainly here in the US
I'm curious what advice you might have for a young biotech entrepreneur now
KMS Well you know
I would say this is the most exciting time for a biotech startup
because you can see that you know
a lot of the new ideas are actually coming out of small biotech startups
And as you heard BioNTech was actually struggling to survive
and suddenly COVID has made them
into a multibilliondollar biotech company today
So I think you know
we must understand that any idea can be a blockbuster idea
And you shouldn't give up on these ideas
And to me you know
entrepreneurship in the tech space is the most exciting space to be in
And I just feel that there are so many challenges
and so many unmet needs
that in our field of biotechnology I think you know 
There's umpteen number of opportunities to be successful
So really the world is your oyster
And I think you know
this couldn't be a better time to be an entrepreneur in the tech world
whether it's information technology or biotechnology or any tech space
I think its a very exciting time
Because today its not just about biotech
it's also about the opportunities in AI
in you know in the kind of IOTs and many many other areas
which are actually leveraging information technologies
for various applications
I mean you think about work from home
which has happened during the pandemic
and you know technology and technologybased companies
are just you know finding so many opportunities
Who had heard of Zoom till the pandemic broke out
You know things like that
SR That's true
I'm curious so you mentioned sort of blockbusters
and that's something else that you talked about a little bit
a couple of days ago
You said for some companies
sort of a blockbuster drug is a onebilliondollar treatment
but that for you a blockbuster is it reaches one billion people
Can you talk about that a little bit
KMS Yeah you know
I've always felt that the Western model
in terms of the pharmaceutical industry
has always been to serve a small population
which is affluent and which can pay a lot for the drug
So it's been about a highvalue lowvolume kind of a business model
Whereas when you live in a country like India with over a billion people
and you're trying to basically address the unmet medical needs
of such a large population
it has to be about economies of scale
It has to be about serving a large population base
So for instance
we are an insulinproducing company
And when I look at producing insulin it has to be affordable
and accessible to a billion people at least who need that insulin
So that's what I mean by saying that for me
a blockbuster drug is about serving at least a billion patients
not about a billion dollars
because the moment you serve a billion patients anyway
it's going to be over a billion dollars of an opportunity
So to me it's about patients first and business will follow
SR Kiran thank you so much for talking to me today
This was great Thank you
KMS Thank you Simone

Thinking about the past week
did any of you forget where you put your phone
Did you have a word stuck on the tip of your tongue
you couldn't remember the name of an actor
or that movie a friend recommended
Did you forget to take out the trash
or move the laundry from the washer to the dryer
or to pick up something from the grocery store you meant to buy
What is going on here is your memory failing
It's not
It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do
For all its miraculous
necessary and pervasive presence in our lives
memory is far from perfect
Our brains are not designed to remember people's names
to do something later
or to catalogue everything we encounter
These imperfections are simply the factory settings
Even in the smartest of heads memory is fallible
A man famous for memorizing over  digits of pi
can also forget his wife's birthday
or why he walked into the living room
Most of us will forget the majority of what we experienced today
by tomorrow
Added up this means we actually don't remember most of our own lives
Think about that
So what determines what we remember and what we forget
Here are two examples of supercommon memory failures
and why they're totally normal
Number one where did I put my phone
my keys my glasses my car
The first necessary ingredient in creating a memory
that lasts longer than the present moment
is attention
Your memory is not a video camera
recording a constant stream of every sight and sound you're exposed to
You can only remember what you pay attention to
Here's an example that will probably feel familiar
I often drive from Boston to Cape Cod
About an hour into this trip I cross the Sagamore Bridge
a really big fourlane cannotmissit structure
And then about  miles and a mere  minutes later
I'll suddenly wonder wait
did I already go over the bridge
I can't recall going over the bridge
because that memory was never created in the first place
It's not enough for my senses to perceive information
My brain can't consolidate any sensory information into a lasting memory
without the neural input of attention
So because I've driven over that bridge countless times
and because I was probably lost in thought or listening to an audio book
so my attention pulled elsewhere
the experience of driving over it slipped out of my brain within seconds
gone without a trace
The number one reason for forgetting what someone said
the name of a person you just met
where you parked your car
and whether you already drove over a really big bridge
is lack of attention
Number two
Oh what is his name
One day I couldn't come up with the name
of the actor who played Tony Soprano in the HBO series The Sopranos
I knew his name was stored somewhere in my brain
and I could tell you all kinds of things about him
but I could not produce his name
I eventually gave up and googled it
Actor who played Tony Soprano
James Gandolfini
Yes that's it
Blocking on a word also called tip of the tongue
is one of the most common experiences of memory failure
You're trying to come up with a word most often a proper noun
but you cannot for the life of you retrieve it on demand
Why does this happen
Blocking on a word can occur when there's only partial
or weak activation of the neurons
that connect to the word you're looking for
We often come up with a loosely related word instead
something similar in sound or meaning
These obliquely related words are rather unfortunately called
the ugly sister of the target
And even more unfortunately
zeroing in on an ugly sister will only make the situation worse
These decoys lead your brain activity down neural pathways that go to them
and not to the word you're looking for
So now when you try to retrieve the word in question
all you can come up with is the ugly sister
Here's an example
I recently asked my boyfriend
What's the name of that famous surfer
Lance
No it's not Lance
He knew who I was talking about
but he couldn't come up with it either
We were both stumped
And turns out my blurting out the wrong name
set my boyfriend's brain to Lance Armstrong
the ugly sister
Now he was stuck in the wrong neural neighborhood and couldn't get out
The ugly sister also explains this phenomenon
Much later once you've stopped trying to find the word
it suddenly bubbles to the surface seemingly out of nowhere
Laird Hamilton
Yes that's it
Why does that happen
By calling off the hunt
your brain can stop perseverating on the ugly sister
giving the correct set of neurons a chance to be activated
Tip of the tongue
especially blocking on a person's name is totally normal
Twentyfiveyearolds can experience several tip of the tongues a week
but young people don't sweat them in part because old age
memory loss and Alzheimer's are nowhere on their radars
And unlike their parents
they don't hesitate in outsourcing the job to their smart phones
Which brings me to an important point
Many of you are worried that if you use Google to look up your blocked words
then you're cheating and contributing to the problem
weakening your memory
You're worried that Google is a hightech crutch
that's going to give you digital amnesia
This belief is misinformed
Looking up the name of the actor who played Tony Soprano
doesn't weaken my memory's ability whatsoever
Likewise suffering through the mental pain
and insisting on coming up with his name on my own
doesn't make my memory stronger
or come with any trophies for doing so
You don't have to be a memory martyr
Having a word stuck on the tip of your tongue
is a totally normal glitch in memory retrieval
a byproduct of how our brains are organized
You wear glasses if your eyes need help seeing
you have my permission to use Google
if a word is stuck on the tip of your tongue
Memory is amazing
and is essential for the functioning of almost everything we do
but it will also forget to call your mother
where you put those glasses
and what you ate for lunch last Tuesday
Frustrating but not a cause for diagnosis panic or shame
Most of what we forget is just a normal part of being human
Thank you
David Biello I will stand in for the audience
to give you my own personal standing ovation
I personally feel so much better
So thank you for that
I think we all get a little concerned about our memories
particularly after this pandemic
And I see that we already have some questions from the audience
But before we get into that I have to ask one very important personal question
which is should I be worried
because every time I get up and go to another room
I forget why I've gone there
Is that is that troubling
Should I be nervous
LG No you should not be nervous
And that's one of the big takehomes of why I wrote the book I just wrote
there's so many people especially over the age of 
who experience normal moments of forgetting
but now we are keyed into it
and we think Oh my God does this mean I'm losing my mind
I'm going to get Alzheimer's
So here's what happens when you have that 
so you're in your bedroom and you're getting ready to read a book
it's bedtime
that's what you do before bed
And you realize you've forgotten your glasses
And you're like they're probably in the kitchen
So you go walk down to the kitchen
and you created the memory
the intention of what you plan to do later
That's called your prospective memory
So it's like I intend  we do this all the time right
When I go to the grocery store later I need to buy milk
I need to remember to call my mother
I need to remember to pick up the dry cleaning right
These things that we plan to do in the future
Our brains are terrible at them like inherently terrible
So people feel like they're cheating if they create todo lists checklists
put it in their phone
No this is just good practice right
So pilots don't rely on their prospective memories
to remember to put down the wheels before landing the plane
They outsource the job
Don't use your brain use the checklist right
So like using a checklist is sound practice
So anyway you made this intention
this memory of like when I get to the kitchen
I'm going to look for glasses
You show up in the kitchen you're like I don't know why I'm here
Part of the reason is prospective memory sucks
But we've only asked it to remember something for  seconds
It's not like Oh I need to remember to go to my Zoom meeting at four o'clock
So what's going on
The other key in this situation has to do with context
So memory is very much influenced by context
The cues the associations
the sensory information the emotional information our mood
anything that is linked to the thing we're trying to remember
So context helps us form a memory
and context helps us retrieve that memory
because memory is the connected neural network of associations
So in the bedroom all the cues for what you needed were there right
The bookcase the book you're reading the time of day it's bedtime
Oh I need glasses
You show up in the kitchen and you're like
Am I hungry Am I thirsty
Because right the cues are signaling
Is it a meal Is it what
And not the glasses that you didn't notice
So when you walk into the room and you're like
I don't know why I'm here
you're not going crazy you're not getting Alzheimer's
your memory isn't terrible
It's go back to the room you were in before you landed in this one
either in your mind's eye or physically do it
and imagine the cues that were there and it will instantly deliver
what you were completely befuddled by a moment ago
DB So a question that's come in from a number of our audience members
including Mel and Lorraine is the flip side of this
So when would you consider
or what kinds of memory cues would be signs of abnormality
or you should get further testing and checking
LG Oh I love this question too
because I think that for too long there's been this disconnect with
you know people are comfortable thinking
about having an influence over their health
from the neck down right
So especially with heart health
a lot of us count our number of steps
or we'll go to the doctor and get blood pressure taken
And do we have high cholesterol
How can I influence these factors right
How can I influence the likelihood that I'll get a heart attack later
But most people don't think they have any influence over their brain health
And so this question is great because it's like
well what can I notice
And then what do I do with that information right
So like don't just panic and don't tell anyone
There's so much shame and stigma attached to anything going on with the brain
and particularly memory
But this becomes information
that you can be in conversation with your doctor about
So what is your cognition
What is your memory today
and what does it look like a year from now
Is it changing
And so what are the differences
So forgetting people's names
totally normal
Names sort of live in like little neurological cul de sacs
like ultimately lots of things connected to them
but really hard in the end to just produce the words
you've got to get to that house at the end of that street
there's only one way in
Whereas common names common nouns are like
in the intersections on Main Street USA
like you can get there are a number of different ways
and it's super easy to get in and out
If you start forgetting common words frequently 
so if I'm like Oh what's the name of the thing you write with
The thing you write with What's that
Pen Yeah 
if that starts happening that could be something
Doesn't have to be Alzheimer's
There are lots of reasons for having issues with retrieving memories
making new memories
It can be sleep deprivation
it could be B it can be lots of things
So you don't have to just jump to Alzheimer's
But it is something that you can hopefully address
Again be involved in your brain health
The other has to do with understanding how things work
what things are for
So like my friend Greg O'Brien has Alzheimer's
and he uses the example which I love and I used in my book is
a lot of people say I can't remember where I parked my car
That happened to me the other day
I was in the mall I got out
I couldn't remember where in the garage I parked the car
I've certainly done this
For Greg who has Alzheimer's it's he drives somewhere
back when he used to drive
parks his car gets out like does something for a minute
So his example's the dump
I went to the dump threw the trash out
turned around standing in front of my car
Don't recognize it as mine
So that's a semantic memory
That car is my yellow jeep and I don't recognize it
And then B forgets that he drove there
So that's an episodic memory a memory for what happened
So just a few minutes ago
I drove to the dump and now I don't remember that I did that
And so that's not the same as like Did I park on level four or five
DB Yeah
So George Weiss
in the helpingusrememberbetter vein
wants to know can diet help us to avoid memory loss
and can you kind of exercise your neurons into better memory
through crossword puzzles or deeper relationships
or anything like that
You're shaking your head no so that's the short answer
LG Yes and no Again I love this question so thank you
Yeah so I tell folks like there's no real gimmick to this
like there's no supplement I can give you
that's going to keep you from experiencing a tip of the tongue
or help you memorize your next TED Talk
Like there's no supplement
the crossword puzzles are not the thing
I don't know who started that one
So crossword puzzles are going to 
think about what youre doing 
you're retrieving words you already know
So you're going to get better at remembering those words
But it's not crosstraining
It doesn't then help you in your daytoday life
remember what happened that day
or again if you have a presentation what you have to say
It doesn't work that way
It's also not building new neural roads
So retrieving information you already know
doesn't lend itself toward neuroplasticity
which is in building something called a cognitive reserve
So every time we learn something new
we're actually building new neuroanatomical
and neurochemical connections
And so if you imagine 
your brain isn't just this pink blob in your skull
in this little black box in your head
it's a very dynamic organ and it's changing constantly
And your genes are interacting with what happens
It's interacting with what you do and experience and feel
and it changes
And the more we learn the more connections we build
And this is important
because if you do start to experience some pathology
that is sort of preAlzheimer's
or if you start to get Alzheimer's
you actually have a lot of reserve
You have backup connections
that can dance around any problems or detours
So learning new things is one way
Exercise has been shown to decrease your risk of dementia
by up to a half
Just daytoday
we know that sleep is massively important
both for preventing Alzheimer's and for your memory today
So the memories that I make today
become longterm stable memories
become longterm stable alterations and neural connections while I sleep
And it's during certain phases of sleep that this process happens
So sleep is not this passive state of doing nothing
It's a very busy biological state
And so it's locking in the information and experiences you learn today
And so that's superimportant
Then tomorrow if I didn't get enough sleep tonight
I'm going to 
my frontal lobe's not going to want to drag itself into its day job
and do the work of paying attention today right
You feel sluggish like Ah I can't pay attention What
If I can't pay attention what's not going to happen today
Making new memories
So I'm not going to remember yesterday
I'm not going be able to make new memories today
I have a form of amnesia just from not getting enough sleep
DB Right
LG So seven to nine hours a night has been shown 
the science is superclear
that this is what we need minimally as a human species
And then in terms of what you eat again there's no perfect study
and there's no rabbitoutofahat I can pull for you
or of like if you eat this
or this nutrient this antioxidant this recipe
it's going to save your memory
It's like no but we know there's been enough to show us
that being on a Mediterranean diet a mind diet
so these leafy vegetables the brightlycolored foods
the whole foods
fatty fishes olive oil nuts beans
these are the kinds of foods that really fuel and support heart health
brain health and memory
And it doesnt have to be  percent folks right
You're not going to be perfect at this
and that's OK
Try to do it overall right
Today what did I eat overall
This week how did I do overall
Because I think we need to have realistic expectations
So exercise
the diet sleep and stress and learning new things
And learning new things is also  it's this it's being around people
If you're in conversation
that conversation's never happened before
So if you're present and paying attention
your brain is getting a lot of stimulation that's superhelpful
DB So Bob wants to know about our capacity our brain capacity
Do we have like a lifetime capacity
and we hit it and then that's kind of it
or is that why children seem to remember things better
than maybe folks of my age
Or is that just I don't know an urban myth
LG Yeah it's myth
This idea that like oh you only use  percent of your brain
or you only use five percent of your brain
someone's making it smaller
I don't know who started that one either
That's not true
So you know at any given moment
I'm using certain parts of my brain right
So I'm not in a rage right now
so my amygdala is kind of chilling
Like I'm not griefstricken
so my amygdala is kind of relaxed
and I have my eyes open
so my visual cortex is lit up
and neurons there are firing
And if I were to close my eyes that part of my brain goes quiet
But all of my brain is being used at some point throughout the day probably
or certainly capable of accessing it
There aren't parts of my brain that I just can't seem to use
and I'm only squirreled away into certain domains
That is a fallacy
And no you don't run out of room
So you know there's a man I use his example in the book
Akira Haraguchi
a retired engineer from Japan who at the age of 
he's the guy who memorized over  digits of pi right
So at an age where we associate
like you know senior discounts and retirements
like he's doing something that is kind of completely mindblowing
And we can all do this if we wanted to
So no at any age youre capable 
So as you grow older
you don't lose the information of stuff you've learned
So the stuff your semantic memory
So this is why you've accumulated a body of knowledge
and you've got wisdom now right
Because now you know how it all fits
and you can use that wisdom you've collected
You've got that
It's not that that starts to go away
You accumulate that
And you might think like
Oh I don't remember much from childhood
I can't really think about
like I can't tell you what happened when I was 
This has more to do with context
It's still in there
So if you know if you live in New York and youre you know
you're surrounded by skyscrapers and city life
and you grew up in rural Vermont
And I can't remember what happened when I was 
Go back to your neighborhood and drive around and
there's the willow tree and there's Ms Richards house
and theres Ms Molansen
oh that's where like Joey broke his leg
and like it all will come back
because again it's like going from your kitchen to your living room
your bedroom to your kitchen to look for the glasses
It's like all that context will reveal memory that you have in your head
you didn't realize you have
You've got trillions of possible connections
And no you will not run out
You can learn to juggle when you're 
You can learn to play piano
You can learn a new language
You can listen to a new TED Talk
and learn and remember something to share with someone else
Like it's unlimited
There's no reason to think there's a limit to it

For as long as weve had language some people have tried to control it
And some of the most frequent targets  of this communication regulation
are the ums ers and likes  that pepper our conversations
Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned against speaking with hesitation
modern schools have tried  to ban the offending terms
and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky dismissed these expressions as errors
irrelevant to language
Historically these speech components had been lumped
into the broader bucket of disfluencies
linguistic fillers which distract  from useful speech
However none of this controversy has made these socalled disfluencies less common
They continue to occur roughly   to  times per minute in natural speech
And different versions of them can be found in almost every language
including sign language
So are ums and uhs  just a habit we cant break
Or is there more to them than meets the ear
To answer this question it helps  to compare these speech components
to other words we use in everyday life
While a written word might have multiple definitions
we can usually determine its intended meaning through context
In speech however a word can take on additional layers of meaning
Tone of voice  the relationship between speakers
and expectations of where  a conversation will go
can imbue even words that seem like filler with vital information
This is where um and uh come in
Or eh and ehm tutoa and  eto and ano
Linguists call these filled pauses which are a kind of hesitation phenomenon
And these seemingly  insignificant interruptions
are actually quite meaningful  in spoken communication
For example while a silent pause might be interpreted
as a sign for others to start speaking
a filled pause can signal that youre not finished yet
Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your speech to catch up with your thoughts
or to fish out the right word  for a situation
And they dont just benefit the speaker
a filled pause lets your listeners know an important word is on the way
Linguists have even found  that people are more likely
to remember a word  if it comes after a hesitation
Hesitation phenomena  arent the only parts of speech
that take on new meaning during dialogue
Words and phrases such as like  well or you know
function as discourse markers
ignoring their literal meaning to convey  something about the sentence
in which they appear
Discourse markers direct  the flow of conversation
and some studies suggest  that conscientious speakers
use more of these phrases to ensure  everyone is being heard and understood
For example starting a sentence  with Look
can indicate your attitude and help  you gauge the listeners agreement
I mean can signal that youre about to elaborate on something
And the dreaded like  can perform many functions
such as establishing a loose connection between thoughts
or introducing someone else's words or actions
These markers give people a realtime view into your thought process
and help listeners follow interpret  and predict what youre trying to say
Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena
arent just useful  for understanding language
they help us learn it too
In  a study showed toddlers  common and uncommon objects
alongside a recording referring  to one of the items
When a later recording asked them  to identify the uncommon object
toddlers performed better if that  instruction contained a filled pause
This may mean that filled pauses  cue toddlers to expect novel words
and help them connect new words to new objects
For adolescents and adults  learning a second language
filled pauses smooth out awkward  early conversations
And once theyre more confident
the secondlanguage learner can signal their newfound fluency
by using the appropriate  hesitation phenomenon
Because contrary to popular belief
the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease with mastery of a language
Just because hesitation phenomena and discourse markers
are a natural part of communication  doesnt mean theyre always appropriate
Outside of writing dialogue they serve  no purpose in most formal writing
And in some contexts the stigma these social cues carry
can work against the speaker
But in most conversations  these seemingly senseless sounds
can convey a world of meaning

I'm talking to you today from my home in Brazil
where I live with my wife and two kids
Let me start by asking a question to the other parents out there
Would you consider asking a total stranger
someone you've never met before never even seen before
to meet your kids after school
put your kids in their car 
which by the way you haven't seen either 
and drive them halfway across town
Even just asking that hypothetical question freaks me out
Let me ask you another question
Would you invest in a business that does that 
have strangers driving kids around town
It seems like an absurdly untrustworthy value proposition
an impossible business plan doomed to fail doesn't it
Well this may come as a surprise to you
but back in 
three moms started a company called HopSkipDrive
with this exact model
It's served one million customers
and in February  raised  million dollars
and expanded to several cities in the US
Is the business foolproof
Well no business is
but it's good enough to keep growing
How did they do that
How did they create trust
in what many of us believe
is one of the most inherently untrustworthy situations possible
The short answer  they built trust in the overall system
Customers don't necessarily trust HopSkip drivers 
that would be relational trust
But they do trust the HopSkipDrive system 
what we call systemic trust
And that's what makes it work
I am fascinated by this
Here in Brazil
people these days tend to say that trust is a rare commodity
I don't think we are alone
Trust appears to have broken down all around us
And yet the concept of trust has never been so fashionable
But what is trust really
Is it a feeling
an invisible part of our human DNA or culture
or this quasispiritual thing like the Force in Star Wars
Or is it really something more concrete
I am an engineer and a consultant 
worse still with a PhD  sorry about that
I study the structures and systems of businesses and organizations
So a couple of years ago
I started wondering whether we could decode and manage
this seemingly intangible concept of trust
I'm pleased to report we are doing it
which I believe is really important
because from my perspective
if we can decode how trust impacts businesses
we can make them more successful
which might mean that their partners and employees
are more engaged and can be more cooperative
And we as customers can be happier more satisfied and safer
when we interact with them
So today I want to present to you the results of our study
and also offer to you a toolbox to build systemic trust
We basically started with a sizable graveyard
of over  failed business ecosystems
And by business ecosystem
we mean a business that can only function if all participants cooperate
Carecom a childcare ecosystem is a great example
Independent babysitters independent parents
all have to work together in order to make the system work
Amazon and Apple iOS are also business ecosystems
It is that necessary cooperation
that makes those business ecosystems a perfect laboratory to study trust
And in this study we defined trust as the confidence
that someone or something will deliver on a promise
or behave as expected
We went into this wanting to understand
whether trust was playing any role whatsoever
in these failed ecosystems' inability to scale and grow
in comparison to their successful peers
For instance we studied Orkut versus Facebook
What is that
You don't know what Orkut is
Why doesn't that surprise me
RIM  Blackberry versus Apple iOS or Android
HouseTrip versus Airbnb
I bet you haven't booked your last vacation on HouseTrip have you
You get the idea
What we found is that trust does play a meaningful role
between success and failure of business ecosystems
It wasn't always the final nail in the coffin
but it was relevant [enough] to send more than half to the graveyard
Why was that
Many of the failed ecosystems made the mistake
of naively assuming that cooperation anchored on trust
would spontaneously emerge between complete strangers
And yet we found more than  percent of uncooperative behaviors
in the failed ecosystems
In contrast
nearly nine in  of the successful ecosystems
actively embedded trust right into the workings of the platform
They built systemic trust
In essence ecosystems were competing on trust
Trust had become a source of competitive advantage
The question then is How did they do it
How did they design for trust
When we examined the successful ecosystems
we found seven trust tools embedded in them
Let me start with the first one access
Many of the successful ecosystems define very well who is allowed in
and who can be kicked out of the platform for bad behavior
HopSkipDrive does access well
It takes the drivers through a strict background check
before they are hired into the platform
They also have a zero tolerance policy
which is superclear to everyone
so drivers know they can be terminated
if they are caught illegally using their mobile phones while driving
Next is contracts
Trustworthy ecosystems formalize a relationship with all participants
through contracts
If you've ever clicked the box I agree to the terms and conditions
you signed an ecosystem contract
Then there is incentives and this is a big one
Successful ecosystems encourage cooperation through rewards
or by motivating participants to interact with each other in a positive manner
eBay and Amazon use reputation as an incentive
If you're a seller and you have good reputation
you can charge higher prices for your products
Then there is control
and I know it's a bit off to talk about control in trust
but we are not talking about forceful control 
its more like a gentle guidance
like an invisible hand nudging you in the right direction
Successful ecosystems shape the behavior of participants
so the kind of cooperation required will emerge in the platform
Uber does control well
and it dictates to the driver the best route to take
so the passenger trusts the driver will not take the longer route
just to make some more money
Then there is transparency
which is superclear isn't it
Sort of ecosystems who are trustworthy make past and present behavior visible
to everyone participating in the platform
And that's the reason why you feel a pit in your stomach
if you've ever booked an Airbnb
with a host who is new to the platform and doesn't have any reviews yet
And of course Airbnb has managed to make transparency work both ways
If you are a guest and you trash a house the other hosts will know about it
thanks to the Airbnb review system
Then there is intermediation
How does the platform act as a middleman
in the moments of truth of cooperation
Taobao Alibaba's online shopping platform
does intermediation when it acts as an escrow agent
between sellers and buyers
It basically holds the seller's money
until the buyer says she is satisfied with the product
Last but not least mitigation
How does the platform handle mishaps
or prevent them from happening in the first place
Did you know that LiveAuctioneers
an auctions platform for art collectibles and antiques
has a broad protection program that guarantees payments on the platform
That's an example of mitigation
So those are the seven trust tools the toolbox
Even more interesting is how they appear to combine
in the successful ecosystems we studied
On the one hand there is no silver bullet
no single tool that can solve for trust
On the other hand
you don't need the seven tools to be successful
You need  on average
So how do you pick
It depends on the kind of ecosystem you design
If interactions among the participants are key
like in most socialmedia ecosystems
you will require a combination of access transparency and control
in order to be successful
These are the very tools Facebook uses
and these are the tools interestingly enough
causing Facebook so much grief right now
When there is a main last mile for the delivery of the promise
like in most gig economy ecosystems
then you will require mitigation in order to cater for failed delivery
When there is a large asymmetry of information
say between sellers and buyers in used goods marketplaces
then you'll require a combination of intermediation and mitigation
And of course when there are many dimensions to the platform
you will require a larger combination of tools
Let me say one more thing
because I've been a consultant long enough
to know that many of the business leaders watching this may be saying
Hey this is great
Let's digitize all these tools
and we'll have the best and most successful ecosystem ever
Well before you move to action let me tell you something
Yes digital plays a meaningful role in enabling trust
and in some cases the very existence of the ecosystem
You could say that digital could be the backbone of systemic trust
However there is no such thing as trustless trust
No matter how fabulous the code how advanced the blockchain
digital cannot solve for trust alone
And that's why we found
nine in  of the most successful ecosystems
to be bionic trust systems
meaning they use a combination of digital and nondigital human tools 
such as contracts policies governance 
in order to build trust on the platform
At the risk of showing my Star Wars fan card again to you
think about it this way
if you want to build a successful ecosystem
and a trustworthy one
you need to think of the Jedi the Skywalkers
Every time they go into an adventure they take their favorite droids with them
RD and CPO
They actually make up a bionic team
I know today we talked a lot about trust in business systems
however that's not where the conversation should end
Systems are all around us 
schools governments health care
Could those systems become more trustworthy
through the use of the tools in the toolbox
I don't see why not
So if you are designing any system but especially an ecosystem
give those tools a try
If you do that
I can almost guarantee the Force will be with you
Trust me
Thank you

A throbbing pounding headache
Bright zigzagging lines  across your field of vision
Sensitivity to light lingering fatigue  disrupted sleep
A migraine can include any of these symptoms
While an incapacitating headache is one of the most common experiences of migraine
the word headache doesnt really capture the wide array of experiences
a migraine can entail
No two are alike and some dont even involve a headache
So what then is a migraine Whats happening in the brain to cause it
To trace a migraines anatomy
we have to begin in the days and hours  leading up to a migraine
when people often identify warning signs  ranging from fatigue or mood changes
to bursts of yawning sleep disruption nausea
light and sound sensitivity or even increased thirst
These warning signs point  to a particular part of the brain
the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus normally controls  the systems behind these symptoms
our bodys internal hormonal balances circadian rhythms and water regulation
It has wide connections throughout the brain
and is more active than usual in the days before migraine
Another common warning sign is the migraine aura
which can take the form  of transient visual changes
tingling or even trouble speaking
These sensations come from a change  in charge across cell membranes
that leads to spreading changes in brain  activity and blood flow across the brain
We don't know what triggers this change in charge
but it can spread quickly  over the surface of the brain
causing different aura symptoms  depending on the affected area
If it inches over the visual cortex for example
it may cause an image or blind spot to spread over the visual field
During the headache phase  the trigeminal nerve plays a key role
The trigeminal nerve normally transmits  touch temperature and other sensations
from the skin to most of the face  part of the scalp
and some of the blood vessels and layers covering the cerebral cortex
Once activated the trigeminal nerve transmits pain signals
During a migraine this pain pathway  becomes sensitized
meaning the threshold for provoking pain is lowered
Sensations that would usually  be painfree
such as coughing bending over  or light and sound can become painful
Migraines are as common as they are diverse
affecting as many as  of women and  of men in their lifetimes
Still theres much we dont know  about them
We can see that migraine  is a neurological disorder
affecting multiple parts of the brain
the brainstem cerebral hemispheres and the nerves themselves
But we don't know for sure what exactly triggers each step
why some people get migraines and not others
why so many more women do than men
or why peoples migraine patterns sometimes change over their lifetimes
Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have a role in some of these things
some women experience a significant reduction in migraine frequency
after menopause  when sex hormone fluctuations are fewer
Meanwhile just before menopause these fluctuations increase
and some women experience  worsening or new headaches
People with migraines are more likely to suffer from depression
panic disorder sleep disorders  and strokes among other illnesses
The relationship with these diseases is likely complex
possibly reflecting the effect of migraine on those diseases or vice versa
or reflecting their shared genetic basis
Genetics almost certainly play a role although with a few exceptions
theres no single gene  that causes migraines
Certain genes control how easily  our brains neurons
are excited by environmental stimuli and  how readily they transmit painful signals
Its possible that the neurons in the  brains of people who experience migraines
are more easily triggered  by environmental stimuli
and less likely to block painful signals
While theres no simple way to explain  what happens in our brains
with this complex disorder
one thing is for sure migraine is much more than a headache

Many animals need sleep
Even brainless jellyfish enter  sleeplike states where they pulse less
and respond more slowly  to food and movement
But all of the threats and demands  animals face
dont just go away when its time to doze
Thats why a range of birds and mammals  experience some degree
of asymmetrical sleep where parts  of their brain are asleep
and other areas are more active
This is even true for humans
So how does it work
All vertebrate brains consist  of two hemispheres the right and left
Brain activity is usually similar  across both during sleep
But during asymmetrical sleep
one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep while the other is in lighter sleep
And in an extreme version  called unihemispheric sleep
one hemisphere may appear completely awake while the other is in deep sleep
Take bottlenose dolphins
Their breathing is consciously controlled
and they must surface for air every  few minutes or theyll drown
When they have a newborn calf they must actually swim nonstop for weeks
in order to keep it safe
So dolphins sleep unihemispherically with just one hemisphere at a time
This allows them to continue swimming and breathing while snoozing
Other marine mammals also need asymmetrical sleep
Fur seals might spend weeks on end  migrating at sea
They slip into unihemispheric sleep while floating horizontally
holding their nostrils above the surface closing their upwardfacing eye
and keeping their downwardfacing eye open
This may help them stay alert to threats from the depths
Similar pressures keep birds partially awake
Mallard ducks sleep in groups but some must inevitably be on the peripheries
Those ducks spend more time  in unihemispheric sleep
with their outwardfacing eyes open
and their corresponding brain hemispheres more active
Other birds have been shown to catch zs in midair migration
While undertaking nonstop transoceanic  flights of up to  days
frigatebirds either sleep with one or both hemispheres at a time
They do so in secondslong bursts usually while riding air currents
But the frigatebirds still sleep  less than  of what they would on land
suggesting a great tolerance for sleep deprivation
Its currently unclear whether asymmetrical sleep
packs the same benefits as sleep  in both hemispheres
and how this varies across species
In one experiment fur seals relied  on asymmetrical sleep
while being constantly stimulated
But in recovery they showed  a strong preference
for sleep across both hemispheres
suggesting that it was more restorative  for them
Dolphins on the other hand
have been observed to maintain high levels of alertness for at least five days
By switching which hemisphere is awake
they get several hours of deep sleep  in each hemisphere
throughout a hour period
This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone meets their needs
So what about humans
Have you ever woken up groggy after your first night in a new place
Part of your brain mightve spent the night only somewhat asleep
For decades scientists have recognized that participants sleep poorly
their first night in the lab
Its actually customary to toss out that nights data
In  scientists discovered  that this first night effect
is a very subtle version  of asymmetrical sleep in humans
They saw that during the first night
participants experience deeper sleep in their right hemisphere
and lighter sleep in their left
When exposed to infrequent sounds
that lighter sleeping left hemisphere showed greater bumps in activity
Participants also woke up and responded to infrequent sounds faster
during the first night than  when experiencing deep sleep
in both hemispheres  during nights following
This suggests that like other animals
humans use asymmetrical sleep for vigilance
specifically in unfamiliar environments
So while your hotel room is obviously not trying to eat you
and youre not going to die  if you dont continue moving
your brain is still keeping you alert
Just in case

For me public space is political
I work with communities around the world
and as we know every community has problems
Some of these problems are solved through the ballot box
or city hall meetings
or community efforts like bike lanes and potholes and school budgets
But some problems are beyond the reach of these structures
like food deserts
community wellbeing
and the loss of cultural identity
These problems cannot be solved with the existing tool sets
I believe that public space is the most potent place to discuss these issues
because it contains the richest diversity of perspectives
And that's what makes it so powerful
The existing parks town squares and sidewalks are not enough though
which is why I'm interested in creating a new type of public space
one that's built by the community and designed specifically for their needs
I start by listening
and by setting up actual outdoor living rooms
complete with couches tables chairs rugs and lamps
as a way of holding meetings to learn about the issues
directly from the community
I use this technique to capture the voices and ideas of people
that might not have time or feel comfortable in more formal meetings
So why get someone to sit in a love seat in the middle of the street
In York Alabama the residents bear witness
to the abandoned houses that cover the town
which are a constant reminder of the white flight that took place
after segregation ended
when white homeowners left the area and let their houses fall into disrepair
Teaming up with the people of York
we transformed an iconic pinksided blighted property in the middle of town
into a new house called Open House
However this house has a secret
It physically transforms into a seat openair theater for plays movies music
or whatever the community would like to experience
And when it folds back up into the shape of a house
the image of the reclaimed pink siding reminds people of the past
After its opening the mayor saw the potential in Open House
and held the next town hall meeting there
The excitement of this unique gathering space brought new energy
and gave a fresh viewpoint to collectively discuss the future of the town
In Cambridge Massachusetts
to highlight the issues of energy waste and climate change
we replaced a garbage can in a park with an anaerobic digester
to transform dog waste into usable methane gas
Burning this methane lights the park
and reduces greenhouse gases
By slightly changing an everyday experience in public space
the Park Spark Project provokes neighbors to have conversations
about the natural and built systems around them
and their connection to the environment
In Lyons Nebraska residents spoke about the loss of social life
as downtown storefronts began to shutter their doors
a result of the slow violence of disinvestment
which has left many rural downtowns empty
To address this loss of human connection
we used an abandoned storefront to turn Main Street into a movie theater
The storefront wall is modified with hydraulics
so that the awning and false front fold down over the sidewalk
with the push of a button
providing seating for 
As the community came together to build a storefront theater
an eccentric postman who makes scifi movies starring his cat
proposed to make a documentary for the debut
And so that summer we turned downtown into a movie set
and the townspeople into actors
to create the movie Decades a history of Lyons downtown
from its founding to the present moment
On opening night the main street
which is usually empty after dark
filled with people to watch the story of their town
leaving locals to question
How will we write the next chapter of Lyons
Well the next chapter started with a series of movie screenings
public events and international musicians
as well as a lowbudget film community that has blossomed in Lyons
bringing in people from all over the world
and a permanent art gallery that has opened next door
My work harnesses the power of the built environment
to focus on issues that communities and local governments
have failed to address themselves
by creating projects so custom fit
that the community naturally makes it their own
When people from all walks of life have a shared experience in these spaces
it can lead to a paradigm shift in how we see our home
our community and the world
For me public space is political
and becomes powerful when it sparks people's imagination to envision
a new future
And although every place I've worked is unique
it all boils down to one thing
if people can sit together they can dream together
Thank you

Today I'm going to talk about a shameful topic
This has happened to many of us and it's embarrassing
but if we don't talk about it nothing will ever change
It's about being hacked
Some of us have clicked on a phishing link and downloaded a computer virus
Some of us have had our identities stolen
And those of us who are software developers
might have written insecure code with security bugs in it
without realizing it
As a cybersecurity expert
I have worked with countless companies on improving their cybersecurity
Cybersecurity experts like me have advised companies
on good cybersecurity practices
monitoring tools
and proper user behaviors
But I actually see a much bigger problem that no tool can fix
the shame associated with the mistakes that we make
We like to think of ourselves as competent and tech savvy
and when we make these mistakes that can have a really bad impact
on us and our companies 
anything from a simple annoyance
to taking a lot of time to fix
to costing us and our employers a lot of money
Despite billions of dollars that companies spend on cybersecurity
practitioners like me see the same problems over and over again
Let me give you some examples
The  hack of Ukrainian utilities
that disconnected power for  customers
and took months to restore back to full operations
started with a phishing link
By the way  customers is a lot more  people
Customers can be anything from an apartment building
to an industrial facility
to a shopping mall
The  data breach of Equifax
that exposed personally identifiable information
of  million people
and may ultimately cost Equifax something on the order of  billion dollars
that was caused by an exploitation of a wellknown vulnerability
in the company's customer consumer complaint portal
Fundamentally this is about technology and innovation
Innovation is good it makes our lives better
Most of the modern cars we drive today are fundamentally computers on wheels
They tell us where to go to avoid traffic when to take them in for maintenance
and then give us all kinds of modernday conveniences
Many people use connected medical devices like pacemakers
and glucose monitors with insulin pumps
These devices make these people's lives better
and sometimes even extend their lives
But anything that can be interconnected can be hacked when it's connected
Did you know that the former US Vice President Dick Cheney
kept his pacemaker disconnected from WiFi before he received a heart transplant
I will let you figure out why
In a digitally interconnected world cyber risks are literally everywhere
For years my colleagues and I have been talking about
this elusive notion of cybersecurity culture
Cybersecurity culture is when everybody in the organization
believes that cybersecurity is their job
knows what to do and what not to do
and does the right thing
Unfortunately I can't tell you which companies do this well
because by doing so I would put a juicy target on their backs
for ambitious attackers
But what I can do is make cybersecurity less mysterious
bring it out into the open and talk about it
There should be no mystery or secrecy within an organization
When something is invisible and it's working
we don't know that it's there until it's not there
Kind of like toilet paper
When the COVID pandemic began
what has been there all of a sudden became super important
because we couldn't find it anywhere
Cybersecurity is just like that
when it's working we don't know and we don't care
But when it's not working
it can be really really bad
Toilet paper is pretty straightforward
Cybersecurity is mysterious and complex
And I actually think it starts with the notion of psychological safety
This notion was popularized by an organizational behavior scientist
Amy Edmondson
Amy studied behavior of medical teams in highstakes situations like hospitals
where mistakes could be fatal
And she found out that nurses were not comfortable
bringing up suggestions to the doctors
because of the fear of questioning authority
Amy helped improve medical teams
to make nurses more comfortable bringing up suggestions to the doctors
for patient treatment
without the fear of being scolded or demeaned
For that to happen doctors needed to listen and be receptive 
without judging
Psychological safety is when everybody is comfortable speaking up
and pointing things out
I want cybersecurity to be the same
And I want cybersecurity practitioners to be comfortable bringing suggestions up
to senior executives or software developers
without being dismissed as those people who continue to talk about
horrors and errors
and say no
Not doing so is really hard
for the individuals who are responsible for the creation of digital products
because fundamentally it's about their pride and joy in their creations
I once tried talking to a senior software development executive
about the need to do better security
You know what he said
Are you telling me we're developing insecure code
In other words what he heard was Your baby is ugly
What if instead of focusing on what not to do
we focused on what to do
Like how do we develop better software
and protect our customer information at the same time
Or how do we make sure that our organization is able to operate
in crisis under attack or in an emergency
And what if we reward good things that people do in cybersecurity in some way
and encourage them to do so
like reporting security incidents
reporting potential phishing emails
or finding and fixing software security bugs
in the software that they develop
And what if we tied these good security actions to performance evaluations
to make it really matter
I would love for us to communicate these good cybersecurity things
and encourage them in some sort of companywide communications
like newsletters blogs websites microsites 
whatever we use to communicate to our organization
What if a company announced a competition for who finds the most security bugs
and fixes them in a twoweek development sprint
and then announces the winner of the competition for the quarter
at a large company virtual town hall
and then rewards these people these winners with something meaningful
like a week's vacation or a bonus
Others will see the celebration and recognition
and they'll want to do the same
In the energy industry
there is a really strong culture of safety
People care about this culture are proud of it
and there is a collective reinforcement of this culture
to make sure that nobody gets hurt
One of the ways they exhibit and keep this safety conscious culture going
is by counting and visibly displaying days since the last safety incident
And then everybody works really hard not to have that count go back to zero
because that means that somebody did get hurt
Cybersecurity is the same as safety
What if we all agree
to keep that count of days since the last cybersecurity incident
going on forever
and then work really hard not to have it reset to zero
And then certain things are a nono
and we need to clearly communicate to our organizations what they are
in an easily digestible and maybe even fun way
like gamification or simulations
to make sure that people can remember this
And if somebody does something they're not supposed to do
they should face some sort of consequences
So for example if an employee buys equipment on Amazon or eBay
or uses personal Dropbox for their company business
then they should face some sort of consequences
And when this happens executives should get the same treatment
as regular employees
because if they don't then people won't believe that it's real
and will go back to their old behaviors
It's OK to talk about mistakes
but just like a teenager who violates the rules tells us about it
we appreciate that they told us about it
but there should still be some sort of consequences
Cybersecurity is a journey
It's not a destination
and we need to keep working on it
I would love for us to celebrate cybersecurity people
like the heroes that they are
If we think about it they are firefighters
emergency room doctors and nurses
law enforcement risk executives and business strategists
all in the same persona
And they help us protect our modern life that we like so much
They protect our identities our inventions our intellectual property
our electric grid medical devices
connected cars and myriad other things
And I'd like to be on that team
So let's agree that this thing is with us to stay
let's create a safe environment to learn from our mistakes
and let's commit to making things better
Thank you

In Kenya buses are commonly known as matatus
They're everywhere  and I mean everywhere
And they form a very crucial part of Kenyans' urban life
They're fun colorfully painted buses
with graffiti that depicts what is going on in Kenya
and the world at large
They're informal and affordable ways for Kenyans to get around
and are used by the vast majority as the main mode of transportation
But they have a couple of flaws
They can be a bit too loud
drive on the wrong side of the road
to avoid traffic
and can be inaccessible for women children and people with disabilities
Back in the s my family was in the matatu business
and ran a popular graffiti matatu called Gridlock'd
Gridlock'd was an American black comedy film
starring the popular rapper Tupac Shakur
My uncles loved Tupac and as a result
I can still sing along to most of his songs
Seven years ago I stepped into the family business
and I brought a twist with me  a feminist perspective
And this is what informs this perspective
women all over the world face sexual harassment while using public transport
In Kenya  percent of women have experienced harassment
while using public transportation
Unfortunately we Kenyans are not alone
In a  study conducted in the US
public transportation was the secondmost common place
for street harassment
This percentage is even higher in Cairo Egypt
where a whopping  percent of women have experienced harassment
while using public transportation
This percentage ranges all over the world
but there's not a single transport system
where women do not face this type of harassment
This leads to a massive financial loss for women
more commute time as they try to avoid dangerous routes
and eventually they drop out of a system that isn't built for them
and doesn't cater to their travel needs
So instead of women using affordable
and environmentally sustainable public transportation
to work school and social events
they use their hardearned and saved monies
on safer but much more expensive means of transportation
that leaves them out of building savings to ensure financial independence
I cringe when newspaper headlines read Let's get rid of matatus
because millions of commuters would be stranded
and thousands of youths unemployed
They say The system doesn't work Let's get rid of it
But I say no
We have a lot to work with and we need to put in the work
For the past seven years
we've worked with over  public transport operators
 transport stakeholders
and over  women professionals in the industry
The interventions that have yielded great impact are driven by research findings
and working with public transport organizations
to change the existing systems
One way we are doing this is by offering trainings
on how to improve commuter experience
For example it used to be that buses would unexpectedly change their route
either to avoid traffic
or the police
and women would find themselves in totally unknown neighborhoods
But now buses are required to display their route map
fare charts
and contact details of how and whom to report any incidences
We've also been actively recruiting and shining a spotlight
on women professionals working in the industry
so more women can join
When more women work in the industry they are in positions to make changes
So we've created a community and an active network
of women professionals working in the Nairobi metropolitan area
who meet regularly and attend professional development courses
Women who are joining the industry have a real voice now
We have a stronger network
more and more expertise
and more money is being put into researching genderbased violence
that plagues women as they go about their day
So instead of getting rid of matatus
let's understand travel habits
Let's train on how to improve commuter experience
Let's change behavior
Let's train on and adopt sexual harassment policies
and let's hire a more diverse workforce
Just like myself and my family
I believe public transportation can be the preferred mode of transport
and workplace for millions of Kenyans

In the s  the discovery of two new drugs
sparked what would become a multibillion  dollar market for antidepressants
Neither drug was intended  to treat depression at all
in fact at the time many doctors  and scientists believed psychotherapy
was the only approach  to treating depression
The decadeslong journey of discovery that followed
revolutionized our understanding  of depression
and raised questions  we hadnt considered before
One of those first two antidepressant drugs was ipronaizid
which was intended to treat tuberculosis
In a  trial  it not only treated tuberculosis
it also improved the moods of patients
who had previously been diagnosed  with depression
In  a Swiss clinician observed  a similar effect when running a trial
for imipramine  a drug for allergic reactions
Both drugs affected a class  of neurotransmitters called monoamines
The discovery of these  antidepressant drugs
gave rise  to the chemical imbalance theory
the idea that depression is caused by having insufficient monoamines
in the brains synapses
Ipronaizid imipramine  and other drugs like them
were thought to restore that balance
by increasing the availability  of monoamines in the brain
These drugs targeted several different monoamines
each of which acted on a wide range of receptors in the brain
This often meant a lot of side effects
including headaches grogginess  and cognitive impairments
including difficulty with memory  thinking and judgment
Hoping to make the drugs more targeted  and reduce side effects
scientists began studying existing  antidepressants
to figure out which specific monoamines  were most associated
with improvements in depression
In the s several different researchers converged on an answer
the most effective antidepressants  all seemed to act on one monoamine
called serotonin
This discovery led to the production of fluoxetine or Prozac in 
It was the first of a new class of drugs
called Selective Serotonin  Reuptake Inhibitors or SSRIs
which block the reabsorption of serotonin leaving more available in the brain
Prozac worked well  and had fewer side effects
than older less targeted antidepressants
The makers of Prozac also worked  to market the drug
by raising awareness  of the dangers of depression
to both the public  and the medical community
More people came to see depression  as a disease
caused by mechanisms beyond  an individuals control
which reduced the culture of blame  and stigmatization surrounding depression
and more people sought help
In the s the number of people being treated for depression skyrocketed
Psychotherapy and other treatments fell by the wayside
and most people were treated  solely with antidepressant drugs
Since then weve developed a more nuanced view of how to treat depression
and of what causes it
Not everyone with depression responds  to SSRIs like Prozac
some respond better to drugs  that act on other neurotransmitters
or don't respond to medication at all
For many a combination  of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs
is more effective than either alone
Were also not sure why antidepressants work the way they do
they change monoamine levels within a few hours of taking the medication
but patients usually dont feel the benefit until weeks later
And after they stop  taking antidepressants
some patients never experience  depression again while others relapse
We now recognize that we dont know what causes depression
or why antidepressants work
The chemical imbalance theory  is at best an incomplete explanation
It cant be a coincidence that almost all the antidepressants
happen to act on serotonin
but that doesnt mean serotonin deficiency is the cause of depression
If that sounds odd  consider a more straightforward example
steroid creams can treat rashes caused by poison ivy
the fact that they work doesnt mean steroid deficiency
was the cause of the rash
We still have a ways to go in terms  of understanding this disease
Fortunately in the meantime  we have effective tools to treat it

I've got to be honest
companies tend to underestimate me
and I want to change that
I think that when companies talk about bringing their products and services
to my European and Asian peers
they automatically consider things like where those peers shop
what are the considerations before purchasing a product
are they brandloyal and who are their influencers
That's great
It's smart business and good marketing
But I'm not sure that those same considerations
are automatically being made
when companies talk about bringing their products to me
In my job
I advise companies and individuals that are looking at investing in
or expanding their African footprint
And the more conversations I've had
the more I realized
that there are still so many companies organizations and individuals
that still completely misunderstand who I am
not only as an African consumer
but as a citizen of one of Africa's  countries
South Africa in case you're wondering
That's a real shame
because these misconceptions will make it hard
to win my share of wallet
And obviously it's not just my wallet on the line
but that of  billion potential customers
There's a lot of money to be made in Africa
And I think if you're a company
and you don't figure out how to get into Africa now
in the right way
you might sadly miss the window
So let me help you by debunking some of these myths
and misunderstandings around Africa and its citizens
The first myth
Africans are cheap
Maybe it's because of my continent's legacy of poverty and famine
that makes people think that we just go for the cheapest product
There are still many companies that think
they can just push their cheapest product lines into Africa
But that is a very dangerous assumption to make
because we don't want to just buy anything that appears in our stores
But we are focused on buying things of good quality
In fact according to research done at my company
where we studied consumers that come from countries
that make up at least  percent of the continent's GDP
we found that we actually make decisions of quality over price
more so than most developing economies and rapidly developed markets
Price usually come second after durability
functionality and efficiency in non grocery items
And it comes second after taste and nutrition in grocery items
Even in the poorest of consumers
who make up the largest socioeconomic group in many African nations
they are still willing to pay a premium for quality
On that note let me tell you something else
New African customers like myself are connected to the rest of the world
Yes we travel
Yes we have the internet
So don't think that we don't notice the differences in the quality
and the seasonality of the clothes you push to your South African stores
versus the one that I can buy in your European branches
And by the way
don't think that my friends and I don't notice
that we have to pay a premium when we shop in your local stores
versus when we shop in your European stores
So this has to end
If you want to play in Africa
it's not about pushing your cheapest product lines into the continent
But it's about developing products specifically made for African consumers
that fit our desire for quality and our diverse budgets
My second myth
Africans don't value brands
Just as you shouldn't push your cheapest product lines into the African market
don't think that your product will take off without any work
African consumers are highly brandconscious
and are loyal to brands that have been around the longest
Because  I'm sure you know what I'm going to say next 
those brands are associated with quality
But there's actually a little bit more nuance to our relationship with brands
Because you see we inherit brand preferences from our family and friends
There was an interesting study done by one of my clients
looking into the cosmetics industry in East Africa
The study found that when young girls enter high school
their mothers introduce them to a specific brand of body lotion
And even though those girls may change brands
once they become older and financially independent
they too will give their daughters that same brand of body lotion
when they reach high school
Brandname recognition is huge
I was actually talking to one of my research colleagues the other day
and we're actually laughing at how growing up in South Africa
Mdantsane to be specific
when our parents had visitors
they would send us to the nearest bazaar shop to buy Coke
But before we leave our parents would ask the visitor
Which flavor Coke do you want
Do you want Fanta Orange
Do you want Stoney or do you want Lemon Twist
And in fact up to today in many South African homes
soft drink is referred to as Coke
toothpaste is referred to as Colgate
margarine is referred to as Rama and the list is endless
So what does this mean
This means that if you want to try and enter African markets
you need to give African consumers a reason to believe
that your brand is the best
and your brand is of high quality
You also need to spend the money to ensure
that your brand is present in all of the places that we Africans shop
I'm talking highend malls
but I'm also talking about local openair markets
Bringing me to my third myth
You see there's still a misconception
that emerging markets like the African continent
and especially the African continent
are laggards when it comes to innovation
or technological advancement
Africa's leapfrog story is at least  years old now
So why is this myth still around
I think it's because when the leapfrog story gets told
it stops at mobile
when in fact our leapfrog story goes far beyond
our massive mobile saturation
But before I tell you that
I think it's only fair that I give credit where credit is due
Africa's leapfrog story is amazing
I hope it blows your mind
that at least  percent of GDP in Kenya and Tanzania
goes through mobile money
Speaking of that
I spent a few months in the US a few years back
I found a great apartment and was ready to move in
when my landlord asked me to cut him a check
for the first month's rental and deposit
And I was like Sorry what
Because I honestly could not remember back then
when was the last time someone back home asked me to cut them a check
But like I said Africa's digital transformation is so much more exciting
We're seeing ecommerce fast taking off
and the new Africa trade agreement
will make it easier for crossborder transactions
which means Africanmade products bought by African consumers
are crossing African borders easier and faster than before
So if your company or your brand is looking to get a piece of the action
now is probably the right time to come in
Now my last myth
which really pains me to have to talk about in 
Africa is one country
I know that I've spoken in great length
about some of the common consumption habits
across the different African markets
But it's important to remember that Africa is not one country
and African communities
even within individual countries are not homogeneous
We speak over  languages
Therefore the customer positioning and target segments for different products
can vary substantially
And if you want to get into Africa
you need to get into the weeds
Take tea and coffee consumption habits for example
Moroccans prefer to purchase their tea in traditional markets
Kenyans prefer to purchase their tea and coffee in supermarkets
while Ethiopians prefer to purchase their products in local kiosks
Local culture also has a big influence on what we buy and where we buy
Take me and my group of girlfriends for example
When you look at this group of  girlfriends
on paper we're the same
Young Black middleclass females
that grew up in one of South Africa's major townships
came to Johannesburg to pursue tertiary education and employment
Some segmentation studies refer to us as Black Diamonds
members of South Africa's fastgrowing
affluent and influential Black community
But if you really do your homework
you will first appreciate that this group of  girlfriends
is made up of five
out of South Africa's  ethnic tribes
And even though our tastes are heavily entrenched
into the urban culture of Johannesburg
our respective traditional culture still influences what we consume
and how we consume it
And it's easy to see if you just open our respective pantries
So if you want your product to thrive in the diverse African markets
you need to do your homework
You need to take your traditional segmentation plans
one or two levels deeper
Yes it's more work
but my continent is worth it
I want to leave you with this
A share of my wallet is here for the taking
But not for long
African businesses are booming
and trade across all  countries is getting easier and faster by the day
So it won't be long before nonAfrican products are less desirable
than the ones that we make here at home
So if you want in great come join us
But do it thoughtfully
do it intentionally
spend the money
and for goodness sake don't underestimate us
Don't underestimate me
Thank you

We are men
We are not beasts and we do not intend  to be beaten or driven as such
What has happened here  is but the sound before the fury
of those who are oppressed
These words were spoken during  the  Attica Prison Rebellion
by one of its leaders Elliott Barkley
At the time Attica prison was severely overcrowded
Its majority Black and Latino population faced constant physical and verbal abuse
All prison guards were white
Some were members  of white supremacist hate groups
Guards threw away letters  that werent written in English
and prohibited Muslim religious services
They punished white prisoners  for fraternizing with nonwhite men
Prisoners were allowed one shower a week and one roll of toilet paper a month
Among those imprisoned at Attica were  Elliott Barkley Frank Smith
and Herbert X Blyden
Im dying here little by little  every day Barkley wrote his mother
She contacted authorities  but nothing changed
He began writing a book about life at Attica
Meanwhile Smith worked a position  called the wardens laundry boy
for  cents day
His grandmother had been enslaved
Because Smith and others were treated  as lessthanhuman
at the will of their keepers they viewed  prison as an extension of slavery
And Blyden had participated  in prison strikes and rebellions
He and others saw the violence of prison as symptomatic of a societal problem
where individuals are denied justice based on their class and race
They felt people shouldnt be stripped of their rights to health and dignity
upon being sentenced
Instead resources should go towards meeting peoples basic needs
to prevent crime in the first place
In the summer of  Blyden cofounded  the Attica Liberation Faction
The group compiled a manifesto
and petitioned  Corrections Commissioner Russell Oswald
and Governor Nelson Rockefeller for better treatment
Though largely ignored  they continued organizing
After activist George Jackson was killed  at a California prison
 men at Attica participated  in a silent fast
Just weeks later on September th a spontaneous uprising began
A group of prisoners overpowered guards sparking the Attica Rebellion
Prisoners broke windows started fires and captured supplies
They beat many guards
One of them William Quinn would die from his injuries
Soon over  prisoners had  assembled in the yard with  hostages
preparing to demand change
They established a medical bay  delegated men to prepare and ration food
protected and sheltered guards  and elected a negotiating committee
They appointed Blyden chief negotiator Smith as security chief
and Barkely as a speaker
Later that day Barkley presented  their demands to the press
When his mother saw him on TV  she was terrified
He was just days from being released
But she believed authorities  would want retribution
Over the next four days prisoners held negotiations with officials
They called for a minimum wage rehabilitation programs
better education and more
They promised all remaining hostages  would be safe
if they were given amnesty  for crimes committed during the uprising
Meanwhile Governor Rockefeller began crisis talks with President Nixon
The president told his chief of staff that the rebellion should be quelled
to set an example  for other Black activists
Commissioner Oswald announced hed meet a number of the demands
but refused to guarantee amnesty
Prisoners refused to surrender
As warnings of an imminent siege mounted
they threatened to kill  hostages  if attacked
Nevertheless Rockefeller ordered troops to retake the prison
Helicopters teargassed the yard
Troopers shot over  rounds  of ammunition
killing  prisoners and  guards  and wounding many others
Witnesses say troopers found Barkley  and shot him in the back
Officers stripped surviving men naked  tortured them
and deprived them of medical attention
Blyden was starved for days
Smith was sexually violated  burned with cigarettes
dragged into isolation and beaten
Directly after the attack  Governor Rockefeller thought prisoners
were responsible for the deaths  of the  guards
He called it a beautiful operation
President Nixon congratulated Rockefeller and told his chief of staff
that the way to stop radicals  was to kill a few
But autopsies soon confirmed  that prisoners
hadnt killed any guards during  the attack as threatened
Government forces had
Nixon told Rockefeller  to stand his ground
Those who survived the massacre continued  fighting for revolutionary change
Long after being released
Smith and Blyden campaigned  for social justice and prison abolition
The demands men made at Attica in 
remain at the core of ongoing protests within and beyond prison walls

You're traveling deep beneath the ocean's surface
where faint lights flicker and toothy grins flash
You are now entering the Twilight Zone
Your mission is to survive these depths
and journey to the surface  after sundown to feed
You may now pick your player
Just kidding you dont have a choice
Youre a hatchetfish
And almost everything else  is trying to eat you
The tools at your disposal  are a uniquely shaped body
shiny scales and glowing spots on your belly
Youre going to need a lot of skill  and a little luck
Your first challenge is to begin  your upwards trek
Your swim bladder allows you  to precisely control your buoyancy
Come nightfall you slowly fill it up
becoming less dense and rising towards the surface
You cant swim fast but your narrow build makes you maneuverable
This is especially important since predators could spring out of the darkness
at any moment
In fact a fangtooth  is gliding beneath you
It has the oceans biggest toothtobody size ratio
Food is hard to come  by in the Twilight Zone
so predators have fearsome adaptations to make every attack count
The fangtooths skin is ultrablack
it reflects less than  of the light  that hits it
making this fish particularly hard to spot
Fortunately the bioluminescent organs lining your belly are regulated
to match the intensity and pattern of the  faint light from the oceans surface
This counterillumination disguises your silhouette
So when the fangtooth gazes upwards youre almost invisible
A bright spot appears in the distance
You go to check it out  but somethings looming in the darkness
The light is a bioluminescent lure belonging to an anglerfish
You dart away before it quickly opens its jaws
sucking in a hapless fish  that got too close
Another narrow escape  but youre nearly there
Although more than   of deepsea creatures are bioluminescent
only one group produces the color red  dragonfishes
One of them is near
Because red light is quickly absorbed  by seawater
most deepsea inhabitants cant see it
The dragonfish emits red light from organs by its eyes
using an invisible headlight to locate unsuspecting prey
that its scoops  into its cavernous jaw
You cant see your enemy
but your silvery mirrorlike scales scatter and soften direct light
keeping you hidden
After three close calls  you reach the Photic Zone
Youve just participated  in the worlds largest migration
It takes place every night as trillions of organisms rise from the oceans depths
to enjoy the surfaces rich resources  under the cover of darkness
The payoff is huge
Here your lightsensitive eyes take in a buffet of small crustaceans
and gelatinous zooplankton
During the day phytoplankton use sunlight to turn dissolved carbon dioxide
into energy and build their own cells
They become food for small grazers forming the base of the food web
which extends back down  to the Twilight Zone and beyond
Organic matter generated up here like bits of skin poop and dead animals
eventually sinks or is transported  in the stomachs of animals
returning from their nightly migrations
These materials then feed the creatures below that don't migrate
This ensures that some of the carbon  from the atmosphere
is locked away in the ocean  for hundreds of years to come
That's why this process is known as the biological carbon pump
Without it thered be much more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
where it contributes to climate change
Your avatar the hatchetfish  is part of this crucial process
Your first quest is complete
but you must repeat this journey  every night for the rest of your life
As the sun rises  the surface becomes dangerous
and you descend back into the shadows  of the Twilight Zone

Every  hours wind generates  enough kinetic energy
to produce roughly  times more  electricity than humanity uses each day
And unlike coal or oil this resource is totally renewed each day
So how can we harness this incredible amount of energy
and is it possible to create a world powered entirely by wind
The basic principle of wind energy  is simple
A series of sails or blades mounted around a rotor catch the wind
and translate its kinetic energy  into rotational energy
Traditional windmills use that rotational energy to grind wheat or pump water
But in modern wind turbines it turns  a generator that creates electricity
This conversion from wind  to rotational energy to electricity
has defined wind turbines since their  invention in the late th century
And there are three primary factors  that determine just how much energy
they can produce the size and orientation of the blades
the blades aerodynamic design  and the amount of wind turning the rotor
First up blade orientation
Wind turbines can be designed  with their rotor
on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis
Vertical blades can pick up wind  coming from any direction
but with much less efficiency than horizontal axis rotors
Horizontal designs allow blades to capture the winds full force
by tracking the winds direction  and turning to face it
This turning process is called yawing
and older windmills achieved it through manual monitoring
Today wind sensors and computer systems automatically adjust the blades
with expert precision to capture as much energy as possible
Outside rotor orientation
the blades themselves need to be shaped to maximize efficiency
While early designs used flat blades
modern blades are curved like airplane wings
Wind travels faster over the curved surface
creating a lowpressure pocket  above the blade that forces it upwards
Since the amount of lift depends on the angle
at which the wind is moving  relative to the blade
modern blades also incorporate a twist
optimizing how much of the blade can cut into the wind
Made of fiberglass and resin layers  these blades are strong enough
to operate through rain lightning  and blistering sunlight for over  years
Even with aerodynamic blades and a horizontal rotor
a wind turbine can only capture wind if it's in a windy environment
Wind speeds typically increase the higher into the atmosphere you travel
So today most turbines are well over  meters tall
with equally large rotor diameters
A turbine of this height and size can capture a huge amount of wind
generating enough electricity every year to power  American homes
A wind farm of  similarly sized  turbines
could power over  American homes or twice as many European homes
for an entire year
Offshore wind farms contain an even greater number of even larger turbines
In  the largest wind turbine  ever built
began operating off the coast  of the Netherlands
With a rotor diameter of  meters just one of these turbines
can meet the annual power needs  of  European households
Despite its amazing potential  wind energy still faces challenges
Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel
but no matter how large or efficient  a turbine is
there's a mathematical limit to how much wind it can convert into electricity
German physicist Albert Betz calculated
that since some wind must remain  to keep the blades spinning
a turbine can only ever capture   of the winds energy
Additionally some people feel turbines disrupt natural scenery
and wind energys intermittent  availability
can make it difficult to integrate  into electrical grids
But even with these challenges modern wind turbines have made wind energy
the most efficient and inexpensive  source of electricity
Wind turbines already provide essential energy for communities around the world
And for many farmers  hosting a wind turbine
can be a reliable source  of additional income
With continued improvements in wind forecasting
electrical grid infrastructure and energy storage
wind power might blow away all our energy problems

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
Im going to start by telling you a story about Danielle
When she was a senior in college Danielle's dad passed away
which left her mom with no way to support herself
So Danielle had to drop out of college
and pick up three jobs as a barista a bartender and a car washer
Altogether the three jobs paid Danielle  dollars per year
which wasn't a whole lot
but it allowed her to feed her mom and keep a roof over their head
And for Danielle that was enough
But early one morning when Danielle was driving home from one of her jobs
a deer ran in front of her car
She swerved off the road and crashed into a barn
And Danielle doesn't remember exactly what happened next
but when she woke up in a hospital a few hours later
a doctor told her that she had damaged her brain stem and C vertebrae
Now the good news is that Danielle was going to leave the hospital alive
But the bad news is that Danielle had  dollars in medical bills
Now Danielle tried so hard for the next two years to try and pay back that debt
but it was impossible
It was impossible for Danielle to pay back  dollars in medical bills
earning just  dollars per year
She felt trapped
One freak accident put Danielle
on the verge of homelessness hunger poverty
And when you're in Danielle's shoes bankruptcy is a lifeline
It's a powerful legal tool that allows you to relieve your debt
and reenter the economy
Medical emergency a job loss a divorce
These are financial shocks that could happen to any of us
And when you're living paycheck to paycheck
and don't have a whole lot of savings like so many Americans
a financial shock can ruin your life
Bankruptcy gives you a second chance
But when Danielle went to go find a bankruptcy lawyer
she like so many others filing for bankruptcy
learned that it was going to cost her  dollars
She didn't have that kind of money
I mean what a cruel irony
In America it costs you  dollars to tell the court
that you have no money
When you walk into a court
everyone from the judge to the clerk to the forms themselves
will tell you to go find a lawyer
no matter how little money you have
One of the great civil rights injustices in America
is that we don't have equal rights under the law
What we have is equal rights if you can afford a lawyer
Whether you're evicted from your home in an abusive relationship
or need access to bankruptcy
you have no right to a free lawyer in most civil cases
And because there aren't even close to enough
pro bono or legal aid lawyers around
four out of five lowincome Americans
can't get the legal help they need to access their civil legal rights
Four years ago I helped start an organization
to fight for new civil right in America
the right to solve your own legal problem when you can't afford a lawyer
We started with bankruptcy
Our nonprofit Upsolve has built an app to help people file for bankruptcy
on their own for free
People like Danielle
Our app asks people questions about their finances
in language they can understand
and then uses this information to help generate their forms
Last year Danielle used Upsolve to file for bankruptcy
on her own for free
She got her final letter from the court relieving all of her medical debt
right after Christmas Day
Today Danielle has the highest paying job she's ever had
and she's on track to finish her degree
There are so many opportunities to create a more just legal system
by empowering people to solve their own legal problems
whenever possible
This is especially true in nonadversarial areas of the law
things like noasset bankruptcies
uncontested divorces and Social Security disability
But there are two main barriers that stand in the way
The first is legal complexity
We've designed our forms in courts around lawyers not regular people
Many legal forms are like modern day literacy tests
When you can't understand them you can't access your rights
Every year poorly designed forms courts and processes
deny millions of Americans their life their liberty and their property
Legal complexity is a civil rights injustice
To start solving this problem
we need to require basic user testing in courts
and reviser assumption in areas of poverty law
that everybody will be able to afford a lawyer
A second barrier is a closed culture
We've been met with pushback from some folks
who believe that you need to go see a lawyer
no matter what legal problem you have
Imagine you had to go see a doctor
to cure a plain old headache
rather than being able to buy Advil at your local pharmacy
Telling a person who is poor to go find a lawyer
when they obviously can't afford one
is out of touch
iIntimidating unfair and wrong
It's also a racial injustice
Black and brown communities disproportionately cannot afford
the legal fees they need to access their civil legal rights
Many legal fees are like modern day poll taxes
When you can't afford to pay the fees you can access your rights
And we have a decision to make
about how open and equal we want our system of justice to be
The only way we're ever going to have equal rights in America
is if we get rid of the modern day literacy tests
and poll taxes that dominate our courts and legal system
We need a new civil right in America
the right to solve your own legal problem when you can't afford a lawyer
Because in America our rights are supposed to be inalienable
our protections are supposed to be equal
and we all deserve a chance at life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
whether or not we can afford the legal fees
Thank you

When we think of solutions to global warming
we generally think in terms of technology or policy
but other approaches are necessary
which have to do with how our societies are structured
The most important of them
is educating and empowering women and girls
Now don't take my word for it
Its potential impact has been calculated by scientists
Like for instance those working on Project Drawdown
who focus on greenhouse gas emissions
They calculated that educating and empowering women and girls
is one of the single most important things
that we can do to confront carbon pollution
It may result in a total reduction of COequivalent gases
of over  billion tons
which is not far from double the total annual global emissions
As a marine scientist and nature adventurer
I've witnessed firsthand
how climate change impacts the world we live in
These climate catastrophes have almost taken my life
Like when I was nearly buried alive during an avalanche
or swept away by a cyclone
Thankfully I survived
but will our grandchildren call this planet home in  or 
if our trajectory continues
Coming from a maledominated society
I've been asked all sorts of intrusive questions
as to why I do what I do
Can you even travel alone
Are you capable of climbing mountains with your heavier figure
I mean are you fit enough
Do you think as a woman you're equipped to do this
And the answer has always been yes
I want to show my fellow Arab women that anything is possible
that being a woman should not be the end to your dreams
that you are so much more than what you are conditioned to be
and that you are indeed the solution to the crisis facing our planet
In  women made up about  percent of the global workforce
Women's shares in the Middle East are just under  percent
And these figures are way lower in the Gulf countries
And considering that women make up nearly half of the Gulf
imagine how women's equal involvement in the economy
could enhance the overall growth of the region
Many labor laws state
that there's no discrimination between men and women
Yet women's upward mobility is quite restricted
and many senior positions are still being held by men
The cultural perception that women are more emotional
or better suited to household responsibilities
remains a serious obstacle for ambitious women
who end up underemployed
So what does that have to do with the climate
Well access to education employment and family planning
is the condition for more vibrant lives for women and girls
for their families and their entire communities
They get to earn more money
achieve career goals and face fewer health issues
And not only that they become more resilient
and better equipped to manage both food and nature
and to cope with the impacts of climate change
Women are also the ones most at risk
when it comes to impacts of climate catastrophes like cyclones
which have grown more frequent in my own home country of Oman
And why
Well because they're left with a charge of the children or elderly
they don't know how to swim
or simply because they never had basic resilience skills taught to them
like building a shelter making a fire
or even administering basic first aid
In fact UN figures indicate
that  percent of people displaced by climate change
are women
And with more of these occurrences happening
my gender will face more of the brunt
further preventing them from achieving their potential
and protecting themselves
This is why I founded WomeX
a platform where we teach women from my community negotiation skills
to nurture a new wave of girl bosses in the region
WomeX is on a mission to laying the groundwork
to combating climate change
by bridging localized context and leadership training
By educating more women on these skills
we hope to equip them with the tools
that allow them to control their careers and their lives
and to contribute significantly to the collective efforts
necessary to confront carbon pollution
So far we've supported a thousand
and are working hard to achieve our ambitious goal of a million
Now even though it has been
on the global sustainability radar for years
gender parity as a climate solution
has not received the attention it deserves
Now is the time to make it a priority
Now is the time to educate and empower all women and all girls
Thank you

Cloe Shasha Brooks Hello Sahaj welcome thanks for joining us
Sahaj Kaur Kohli Thank you for having me
I'm so excited to be here
CSB I'm so excited to be speaking with you
So you are a mental health therapist in training
and the founder of Brown Girl Therapy
a community you started to allow the children of immigrants
to speak openly about mental health issues
And one theme I've noticed in the content you share
is the guilt frequently experienced by people with immigrant parents
Can you talk more about that guilt
SKK There's definitely a relationship
between being a child of immigrant parents living in the West
and experiencing guilt
Children of immigrants are often straddling two cultures
known as bicultural straddling
And there's often this expectation
to make our immigrant parents' sacrifices and choices
for coming to this country worth it
Many children of immigrants feel chronic sense of guilt
for letting their parents down
for not being enough for being too American
for seeming ungrateful
Theres also this sense of a thrivers guilt
or this guilt of growing healing
accessing resources and opportunities that maybe our parents didn't have
or our family and other parts of the world don't have access to
So many children of immigrants may have grown up being responsible
for their parents as well
If we think about an immigrant's journey to the West
they may not speak English well
so a lot of children of immigrants may act as a translator
may help pay the bills
may help take care of younger siblings
so caretaking
and we know that immigrating and immigration
can lead to a lot of family and generational conflict
as everyone in the family is navigating their own acculturation journey
creating a sense of belonging in the host country
So a lot of children of immigrants are often mediators
for cultural conflict within their family
This responsibility for the wellbeing of our parents
whether it's explicitly or implicitly stated
can be reinforced over the years as a sense of obligation
And it's exhausting
You know children of immigrants are often internalizing these beliefs
that they have to be a certain way
that they have to act a certain way
and then they're out in the world feeling like they're also not enough
in the Western sense of the word
And so it's really important you know
I think in a lot of immigrant communities
and for a lot of children of immigrants
we don't talk enough about questioning that guilt
questioning where it comes from and questioning why it's there
CSB Yeah so interesting
It looks like we have a question from the audience
Is long term guilt ever justified or beneficial
SKK So the thing we know about guilt is that there is healthy guilt right
Healthy guilt alerts us to our morality
to the pain and hurt that we might be causing to other people
to the social and cultural standards that we may have crossed
And it can help direct our behavior
If we're really sitting with it we can understand
OK you know what
I didn't want to hurt that person or I didn't want to do that thing
So that can help you then decide to make amends
to change your behavior to apologize
But then we have unhealthy guilt
where maybe the guilt that we're feeling is adopted through values
that we don't necessarily hold
or boundaries that we don't necessarily want to hold
So longterm guilt 
guilt is not necessarily a negative emotion
It's really important to understand that differentiation
that guilt is something that can really guide us
And like any emotion it's telling us something
and we must listen to it before we decide how to handle it
CSB Yeah
And in the unhealthy situation
what are some helpful strategies for dealing with it
I suspect it will be relevant to many demographics of people
SKK So you know
the thing about chronic guilt is that it can force us to be small
It can tell us we must stay within the box
We shouldn't take up a lot of space
It kind of encourages us to distrust our own needs and wants
especially if they differ from the people around us
and our immigrant parents
So some strategies for adopting and dealing with guilt
It's really important to question the guilt
It's important to identify your parents's beliefs and values
and then explore your own and see how they overlap
Ask yourself How can I lovingly detach
from the assumption or belief my parent has
Ask yourself
if you are internalizing something that doesn't actually speak true to you
Remind yourself also
that your parents are often doing the best they can
with what they know and what they were taught
And with that you have to have a lot of selfcompassion
to know that you're figuring out how to deal with something
that maybe no one in your family has dealt with
You were never taught how to deal with
So it's really important to show up with a lot of self compassion
And then the last thing that really comes to mind here
is to accept that guilt may always be an emotion
that you have to navigate
It's a warning light
I think a lot of children of immigrants look to guilt and feel guilt
and then say Oh my gosh
this is a sign that I need to turn around and not do the thing I want to do
or continue on the path Im about to take
And instead I say sit with the guilt
see it as a warning sign
and try to understand where it's really coming from
CSB Yeah that's incredibly helpful
We have a question from the audience
What coping mechanisms
would you recommend for someone dealing with guilt
SKK So all of the things
some of the coping mechanisms I already named you know
it's really important to reauthor the narrative that you've been taught
that things are binary
Something that I often see when people are dealing with guilt
is that guilt is bad
Again guilt is not necessarily bad
It's just an emotion that is trying to tell you something
So a lot of children of immigrants
and a lot of people in this country
think of feelings as good or bad
think of themselves as right or wrong
this or that all or nothing
And I really want to encourage you to question that narrative
You know two things can be true at the same time
You can pursue something that makes you really happy
something that is inherently good for you healthy for you
and you can still feel guilt
And so to that I just really want to drive home the point
that guilt is not necessarily a bad emotion
And it's OK if you are always trying to navigate it
CSB You know one thing that I've also seen you talk about
is how values
getting clear on our values helps us manage our guilt
Can you share more about that
SKK Absolutely
Getting clear on your values can definitely help with managing guilt
It's important to get clear on your values
instead of assuming that your values are exactly the same
as the people around you
And when you're not clear on what's important to you
it's really easy to follow into a pattern of what's expected of you
what other people want from you
And this can lead to a lot of peoplepleasing behaviors
it can lead to seeking approval
maybe keeping the peace because that's what you've been taught
but it doesn't necessarily lead to personal fulfillment
So to get clear on your values
really spend some time reflecting on questions like what's important to you
when have you been the happiest
And think about the times that you've been the happiest
and then think about values that were being honored during that time
When were you the most unhappy
And think about values that might have been suppressed or crossed
We have to think about living our lives with valuedriven choices
But that's really hard to understand if your values don't overlap
with the people you love
And so what I hear from children of immigrants a lot
is My values aren't the same So then what do I do
And so to that I say try to find ways to communicate to your parents
a lot of the assumptions and beliefs and values our parents have
some of them may be rooted in fear
If they're not necessarily happy with a career choice that you're making
but that aligns with your values
try to address the fear that's coming up
The fear that they have
that you won't be secure when they're not here
that you won't be able to make enough money
that you won't be satisfied for years to come
and try to address those fears
to communicate your values to your parents
CSB Yeah that makes a lot of sense
especially with different cultures and figuring all that out
So we have another question from the audience
Let's bring that one up
How do you recommend that people address feelings of guilt
tied to someone who is deceased
From John Henderson
SKK That's such a great question
You know what I see in the immigrant community
and with children of immigrants that may be really relevant here
is that guilt is often tied to grief
You know the guilt of feeling misunderstood
the guilt of feeling like you can't do the things that you want
the guilt of feeling like you're not enough
are tied to a grief of something that you didn't have
Maybe it wasn't the support from your parents
Maybe it wasn't the relationship that you really wanted
So to that you know for navigating that
I would say try to get really clear on what it is you feel guilty about
and what it is that you're grieving and how you can separate those two
And I would really recommend seeking community and support for this
and also therapy
CSB Yeah absolutely
But we've come almost to the end
if you could just say one thing that you think would be really important
for people to remember when they're experiencing guilt
what would it be
SKK You know I'm going to drive home the same point
it is that guilt is a warning sign
Sit with it identify your values and standards
that are being crossed when you feel guilt
identify if they are your values and standards
or someone else's that you have internalized
and then try to sit with what's important to you in that moment
before you decide what your next step should be
CSB Fantastic
Well thank you so much Sahaj for sharing all this
and for your wisdom
Take care thanks for joining us
SKK Thank you so much for having me

Your eyes get heavy and gradually  close
But wait
Its only lunchtime and you still have so much to do
Would taking a nap help Or would it derail your day
Our sleep both at night and in naps
is made up of approximately  minute sleep cycles with four stages each
A nap can last anywhere from five minutes to three hours
so it can include full sleep cycles or just a few stages
As you fall asleep you enter Stage  the first two to five minutes of sleep
Stage  comes next for about  minutes
In Stage  body temperature drops  muscles relax
and breathing and heart rate  become more regular
Your neurons start to fire in unison
creating waves of activity  that sweep across the cortex
punctuated by rapid bursts  of neural activity called sleep spindles
As you enter Stage  or slow wave sleep
the rolling waves increase as your neurons fire in coordination
This phase lasts about  to  minutes and is where your deepest sleep occurs
Then you enter REM sleep which lasts about  to  minutes in a nap
In REM the brain becomes more active more like your brain activity while awake
The end of REM signals  the completion of a sleep cycle
OK but will a nap make you feel better
Well that depends on a few things
especially what stages of sleep the nap includes
Take a  minute nap  which consists mainly of Stage  sleep
Stage  sleep is associated  with longterm potentiation
a process that's thought to strengthen the synapses between neurons
which is essential for learning
A  to  minute nap stops short of Stage s deep sleep
making it relatively easy to wake up from
A  to  minute nap meanwhile has the benefits of Stage  sleep
and also takes you into the deeper sleep  of Stage 
During Stage  multiple brain areas work together to transfer information
from shortterm memory storage to longterm storage
stabilizing and strengthening  longterm memory
by coupling sleep spindles  with slow waves
Stage  is the most difficult stage  to wake up from
So while a  to  minute nap can have cognitive benefits
those benefits often dont kick in until  about  minutes after waking up
 to  minute naps enter the REM stage
While in REM the prefrontal cortex
which is largely responsible  for inhibition and cognitive control
becomes much less active
Meanwhile the amygdala  and cingulate cortex
regions associated with emotion  and motivation are highly active
Researchers have posited that  the combination of these things
leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep
the decrease in inhibition and cognitive control might lead to wild associations
and thanks to the amygdala  and cingulate cortex activity
those associations can be  between emotionally charged topics
Some researchers think this stage might help us make innovative connections
between ideas upon waking
Because the brain activity during REM is closer to waking
it may be easier to wake up from REM  than Stage 
even though the nap is longer
The time of day also matters
Our need for deep Stage  sleep  progressively increases
throughout the day
So if you nap later
you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure needed to go to sleep at night
This doesn't happen for REM sleep
Longer periods of REM occur during morning hours
so morning naps are dominated by REM
midday naps have about equal parts of REM and deep sleep
and evening naps contain more deep sleep
On top of all this it seems  that were just about evenly split
between nappers and nonnappers
Nappers consistently show cognitive benefits from napping
but nonnappers may not
Researchers think this could be  because nappers
are able to stay in a lighter sleep and move through sleep stages more easily
Meanwhile nonnappers may experience more deep sleep while napping
making them groggy afterward
So will a nap help
Well theres only one way to find out

Helen Tupper When we met at university  years ago
we made for unlikely friends
I'm an extrovert who gets involved in everything
and talks to anyone
Sarah Ellis  and I'm an introverted ideas person
who finds extroverts energizing but a bit intimidating
HT Despite our differences we both had an ambition to climb the ladder
and have a successful career
SE We were motivated by how far and how fast we could progress
and we thought that our route to the top would look something a bit like this
And in those first few years of work
we were all about promotions and pay rises
We were preoccupied by the positions that we held
and how senior our job titles sounded
And on the surface everything seemed to be on track
But we started to get the sense
that the ladder might actually be holding us back
The obvious next step wasn't always the most appealing
and we were both excited about exploring opportunities
that weren't necessarily based on what we'd done before
It wasn't what we'd anticipated
but our careers had started to look and feel much more like this
Squiggly
HT A squiggly career is both full of uncertainty
and full of possibility
Change is happening all of the time
Some of it is in our control
and some of it's not
Success isn't onesizefitsall
Our squiggles are as individual as we are
And for me that's meant a career
where I've moved from working on foldable credit cards in one company 
they didn't catch on 
to building and launching a loyalty app for another
And that one is still going
SE And I've moved from making magazines
to working on food waste
from a five to a fourday week
so I could spend more time on personal projects and volunteering
I've already had more jobs and worked in more organizations
than my dad
and he's been working for twice as long as I have
And I'm the rule not the exception
HT When we started to share the idea of squiggly careers with people
we were surprised by how much it stuck
It seemed to give people something
that perhaps they didn't even know that they needed
a way of describing both their experiences and their aspirations
Someone even told us that they took our book
which has a big squiggle on the front of it
into a job interview
as a way of describing their career so far
But we underestimated one big problem
the legacy of the ladder is all around us
It's in the companies that we work in and the conversations that we have
It sounds like being asked in a job interview
Where do you see yourself in five years' time
It's the uncomfortable question of how we reward and motivate people
who do a great job but don't want to be promoted
And it's the unfairness of our learning being unlocked
by the level that we reach in an organization
SE Career ladders were created as a way to manage and motivate
a whole new generation of workers 
in the early s
And that world of conformity and control from over  years ago
is unrecognizable today
especially when we consider
only six percent of people in the UK now work ninetofive
We can all expect to have five different types of career
And the World Economic Forum estimates
that  percent of the skills that we have right now
won't be relevant by 
HT Ladders are limiting
They limit learning and they limit opportunity
and if organizations don't lose the ladder
they will lose their people
the people that are always adapting
that never stop learning
and who are open to the opportunities that come their way
 disrupted the way that all of us work
and none of us know what will happen next
But one thing we can be confident about
is that the ladder is a redundant concept of careers
SE Losing the ladder starts with redefining
our relationship with learning at work
We all now have the chance to curate our own curriculums
and we can be really creative about what that looks like
whether it's the TED Talks that you're watching
the books and blogs you're reading
the podcasts you're listening to
Your learning is personal to you
And the good news is your development is no longer dependent on other people
HT Our learning can't be limited by the level we reach in an organization
or only available to the fortunate few
It's not the responsibility of a single department
and it doesn't just happen when you go on a course
No one has a monopoly on wisdom
In squiggly careers everybody is a learner
and everybody is a teacher
We've been inspired by MVF
a global technology and marketing company who've introduced a program
called Connected Learning
They blindmatch their employees so that people can learn from each other
without barriers like what job they do or who they know
getting in the way
Their CEO Michael Teixeira told us
Everybody is in charge of their own learning here
We all learn from each other and with each other
and we're much better off as a result
SE In squiggly careers we need to change our perspective on progression
The problem with career ladders is that they only go in one direction
and you can only take one step at a time
If progression purely means promotion
we miss out on so many of the opportunities
that are all around us
We need to stop asking only What job comes next
and start asking What career possibilities am I curious about
HT Exploring our career possibilities increases our resilience
It gives us more options
and you create more connections
We see how we can use our strengths in new ways
and spot the skills that might be useful for our future
We can all start exploring our career possibilities
It might be an ambitious possibility that you don't feel ready for yet
Or perhaps it's a pivot that feels interesting
but just that bit out of reach
Or maybe it's a dream that you've discounted
The most important thing
is that you give yourself the permission to explore
SE And this is not a oneway street
We need support from the people that we work for
and the organizations that we work in
And we've seen how this can work in practice
at a food manufacturer called Cook
They have something called the Dream Academy
And in this academy their colleagues can explore any career
that they're intrigued by
in or out of the organization
and even rediscover abandoned ambitions
It could be to try standup comedy
to write their first children's book
to move from marketing to finance
become the CEO
Nothing is off the table
One employee said
The Dream Academy didn't open doors for me
It helped me to have the confidence to open them for myself
In career ladders
our identity can become about the titles that we've held
rather than the talents that we have
Everyone is talented
and we can use those talents in many ways
We don't need to constrain our careers
In the words of my favorite band Fleetwood Mac You can go your own way
HT One of the things that sticks with me from my time at Microsoft
is that I'd go into the office and I'd see a sign that said
Come as you are and do what you love
And this was more than just words on a wall
As a nontechie with a podcast on the side
I certainly brought something different to the organization
But my uniqueness was embraced
and there was no pressure to fit a perfect mold
I felt like I could be open about what I wanted to do
and where I wanted to go
even if that was different to everybody else
In squiggly careers there is room for everybody to succeed
And no two squiggles are the same
The ladder has been holding us back for far too long
But it's not easy to change something that's been around for over  years
What we need now is more than a radical rethink
We need a radical redo
and change comes from action
SE Together we have an ambition to make careers better for everyone
And we've seen just what's possible when people let go of the ladder
We see people who define their own success and take control of their careers
And we see organizations who benefit
from adaptable employees who are curious confident and continually learning
HT We want to ask you to become an advocate for squiggly careers
You might be a manager who could help somebody to explore
their career possibilities
Or maybe youre a mentor and you can give someone the confidence
to see how they can use their talents in new ways
And now that we're all teachers
let's share what we know so that everybody can succeed
SE It's finally time for us all to step off the ladder
and into the squiggle

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
I want to find aliens
Finding life on another planet is not just going to be a little hard
it's going to be very hard
But for the first time in human history
we have a chance to detect signs of life on another planet
Or maybe we've already detected it on Venus
Or maybe not
There are still two big hurdles
when it comes to confirming life on another world
The first is building a telescope big enough to do this
and the second is interpreting what we will find
When we think of extraterrestrial life
we tend to think of aliens like funny little green men
not aliens as singlecelled microbes
But it's actually detecting signs of microbial life on another planet
that I'm most optimistic about and what I focus my research on
I model how a star's highenergy radiation
can make gases from microbes harder or easier to see
with future telescopes
Microbes have dominated our planet's biosphere for most of Earth's history
They've been emitting gases that can be seen in our atmosphere 
even light years away 
for billions of years
Now if an alien astronomer were looking at Earth
they would probably detect gases like oxygen methane and nitrous oxide
before detecting signs of us
Even with an active biosphere like Earth's
most of the gases that indicate life are coming from singlecelled microbes
not from animals
This is what we'll try to do in the next decade of astronomy 
try to find signs of microbial life on planets orbiting other stars
But the technology to detect the atmosphere
of a planet the size of Earth
around another sun
is incredibly difficult
It's like trying to determine the size of a firefly in front of a spotlight
while looking from another continent
What's amazing is that with telescopes in the s
we're overcoming this technological barrier
The second issue defining alien life
will be to interpret what these biosignature gases actually mean
Twentyone percent of our atmosphere is oxygen
and nearly all of that oxygen comes from life
So here's the tricky question
Would detecting oxygen on another planet mean life
No not necessarily
because we know of ways to get oxygen without biology
I try to understand a planet's geology and its star's radiation
so that we can better identify a true life signal
And this is what makes the preliminary detection on Venus of phosphine
a potential biosignature gas
so compelling but also so confusing
Venus is not where we expected to find life
It is a hellish world
with a surface temperature of nearly  degrees Fahrenheit
Could life be floating in the more temperate upper atmosphere
But then how would such life eat and reproduce
This discovery will have to be vetted over the coming decade
First we must verify the detection of phosphine itself
and then later we would have to confirm that this gas is coming from life
and not from some unexpected geological or photochemical process
If true this would be one of the most profound discoveries of our generation
If it turns out that we were fooled
that we mistook this gas for biology when it's from some other process
we will have a sobering lesson to apply to planets orbiting distant stars
Venus is close  literally our nextdoor neighbor 
and yet we still have trouble understanding it
The planets we're finding orbiting other stars
are weird and unexpected
Some have the density of cotton candy
and others rain molten iron
And most stars are different from our sun
with highenergy flares that can make it difficult for life
So the more we're looking at different biosignature gases
the more we realize that there's no single gas
that's enough to understand a planet and to claim alien life
It is just really difficult to distinguish life from nonlife
from light years away
And here's where the ambiguity lies
How will we know if a clue is a sign of life or is not
Well first we'll need to understand as much as we can
about a planet's geology and the star it orbits
We'll learn vital lessons by exploring our own solar system
in places such as Venus and Mars
We're getting closer to answering one of humanity's biggest questions
Are we alone in the universe
Any claim will be hotly debated
So basically I'm stretched between two desires
I want to find alien life but likely will not have a clear answer
And that's OK science is nuanced and selfcorrecting
It's what I love about it
Science is about balancing this duality of skepticism and of hope
We won't be able to teleport ourselves to another planet
and take pictures of alien kangaroos jumping around
And without an intelligent Hello Earthlings signal
we might still feel lonely
even if we find out we're not alone in the universe
Despite these challenges I'm super excited about alien microbes
and what they could teach us
Even if we find just one other sign of life
then likely the universe is teeming with it
from singlecelled to complex
If we search for decades and find nothing
then that is equally humbling
But we must try
We must do this search even when it means sitting with uncertainty along the way
Thank you

Chris Anderson Simon I'll start us off by saying I mean here we are look
after a year of the pandemic
probably one of the most extraordinary experiences any of us have had
What do you think the unexpected psychological carryovers might be
I mean do you think we've kind of 
Part of me thinks that people have got more fragile
that it's almost like there's a sort of learned timidity
Have you seen any evidence of that or how would you characterize it
Simon Sinek I think we've definitely all become much more aware
of mental health
And that it's a real thing
and that mental health affects strong and healthy people
We all suffered trauma during COVID
Some of us dealt with it earlier some of us dealt with it later
some of us are still dealing with it but nobody escapes it
When COVID first started you know
many of us had to pivot our organizations
had to pivot our businesses very quickly
And so I like many others we went into mission mode
And I called a friend of mine who is activeduty military
And I asked him a very simple question
how do I compartmentalize my emotions so that I can stay focused on the mission
And he gave me a very stern warning
He said you can't
He said we can compartmentalize our emotions for only a short period of time
but no one no one escapes the trauma of combat
And he said you may not even experience the trauma while you're in it
you may not experience it when you first come home
you may experience it months later
He says I experience it four or five months after I get home
So immediately I hung up the phone
and called all my Atype personality friends
and said OK we think we're good
but we're going to get hit by this at some point
And we made a deal that when we started to feel off our game
we would call each other
Safe space
And we made another deal that there would be no crying alone
That if you had to cry you picked up the phone and you called somebody
Well about four or five months into COVID
I started to feel off my game and I didn't know what was going on
And so I called that same friend in the military
and I asked no leading questions
I simply asked him tell me what your symptoms are when you suffer the trauma
when you come home from combat
And he said well number one he falls out of his sleep pattern
He said he starts going to bed late for no reason
and doesn't want to get up in the morning
And I thought to myself yep
He says he has some unproductive days and he comes up with an excuse like
It's OK you know you deserve a rest It's fine
But then he has another and another and another
And I thought to myself yep
And he said he becomes very antisocial where he doesn't want to ask for help
and he definitely doesn't want to talk to anybody
And I thought to myself yep
And I realized what I was going through was trauma
And I was afraid to use the Dword depression
for fear that that was some sort of diagnosis
I think a lot of people are afraid of that word
but that's exactly what I was going through
I was going through  lowercase D depression
And I followed the rule that we set with our friends
and I called people
Because one of the things I asked my friend is like
how do you overcome it
He said you have to force yourself back into a sleep pattern
and force yourself to call friends and ask for help
And so I think one of the things
I think that comes out of COVID
is we recognized just the importance of human connection
You know in this fastpaced digital world
we kidded ourselves to think that we had connections
just because we were connected
But it was amazing to see when COVID started
regardless of someone's age or a technological competency
we all picked up the phone
Like young people were talking to each other
And I think that intense craving for a human voice and human touch
I think we were reminded just how fragile we are as human beings
CA That phrase you've mentioned no crying alone that's powerful
I mean forgive me asking did you cry with someone
SS Yes
I followed my own counsel to my friends
And when I had to cry when I was overwhelmed
I picked up the phone and I just cried
And I had friends call me and do the same
CA And there was healing in that
SS The most important thing that came from it
was that we didn't 
none of us felt alone
And there's intense safety
That amazing sense of safety that we all desire as human beings
You know you can't feel safe when you're vulnerable
like that's when we need it the most
But you have to build those relationships
You build those relationships in the happy times the good times
where you think you're strong you think you're great
Its very hard to start building those relationships
in the moment of crisis
And I think it's a lesson for leadership quite frankly
Which is you can't judge the quality of a crew
by how a ship performs in calm waters
You judge the quality of a crew by how a ship performs in rough waters
But the time in calm waters
is when you're building relationship and trust
and you don't really actually know if you have trusting relationships
and trusting teams and loving relationships
until the crisis strikes
And I heard this from a lot of people
When COVID happened
they commented on how they realized who their real friends were
Some people kind of fell by the wayside it was nothing personal
It's just like we didn't call each other and we're still you know
werent angry or anything
And there are some people who came out of the woodwork to check in on us
and those friendships flourished
And that's what I mean
It takes hardship for those friendships and that trust to really bear fruit
But that's why we have to invest in people when we're doing well
and we don't think we need anybody
And I think we forget that
CA What would you say to someone who has realized
that they're in this moment what's been a really difficult year
and they actually don't feel that there's someone they could
for example
pick up the phone and cry with
Is it hopeless for them until this passes
Or what would you say to them
SS There is an irony
There's an irony in when we need help
And when I was writing the book Leaders Eat Last
I had the opportunity to spend some time with
and visit Alcoholics Anonymous
And it is a remarkable organization
And many of us are familiar with the step program
And many of us are familiar with the first step
which is admitting you have a problem
But then it's the other  steps that also matter
And Alcoholics Anonymous knows
that if you master the first  steps
but not the th
you are likely to succumb to the disease
But if you master the  steps
you're more likely to overcome the disease
That th step is to help another alcoholic
It's service
And so there's a great irony when we need help
to actually help someone
who's struggling with the same thing as us
And it is the most healing thing we can do
So you know if we need someone to cry with
it's to offer the shoulder for somebody else to cry with
If we're feeling lonely
it's to be there for someone else who's struggling with loneliness
And this goes way beyond these subjects
which is if we're looking for love to help somebody else find love
if we're looking for the job we love
to help somebody else find the job that they love
And there's tremendous value in service
And you hear about these things all the time
you talk to people why they chose to go in the profession they went into
especially if they're in the service profession
let's say somebody is a counselor for trauma
And you say why did you go into this profession
When I was younger I suffered a trauma
and somebody was there to counsel me
and I decided I wanted to commit my life to doing that for others
This is what happens with service
And we forget just because we live in a modern world
we're actually a very oldfashioned machine
The human animal is a legacy machine living in a modern world
And we still work the same way we used to
And we desperately need each other to survive and thrive
as much as we did when we were living in huts
in small tribes of  people
And so service service is the thing
CA That sounds like
even for someone who's not feeling like depressed or at the edge right now
but a good checklistquestion to ask is
is there someone I could reach out to actually
there maybe other people who are in a much worse situation
and maybe there is a call I could make
that would be incredibly valuable to that person
and help build a relationship with future
SS Are you OK How are you
You know a friend of mine George Flynn
he says his test for a leader is if they ask you how you're doing
they actually care about the answer
And I really like that
CA OK I could talk with you for hours about this
but we're going to go to some questions now
So here's a question from Kayum
If there is no way to get back to normal as you said
then are we on the right path of building new normal already
Or can you help us with a blueprint that new normal should be based on
SS So blueprint No
Guidances Yes
I think that humanity has to be 
We have to remember that humanity matters
And when I say humanity I don't mean bigH Humanity
I mean littleH humanity our humanity
When COVID first happened
so many leaders leaned on their humanity
whether they were effective or ineffective leaders prior to COVID
many of them picked up the phone and said Are you OK
They called their teams just to check in on them
Or they called their friends to say Are you OK How are you
Well we don't need a global pandemic to do that
That's called good leadership
and we should be doing that all the time
And we should be encouraging those in our charge to do the same
for those in their charge
You know the hierarchy can still be effective that way
I hope that remains
I hope that remains
I hope the use of the telephone remains
That we don't just go back to texting all the time
I hope that putting our phones away and having family dinner remains
I think there's a lot of kids
that will actually come through this
with stronger relationships with their siblings if they have them
and stronger relationship with their parents
because they had so much time together
And kids who may have struggled prior
because they weren't getting the kind of attention they needed
because their parents were so busy with work
you know even if mom or dad are busy on a Zoom call all day
that hour that they would ordinarily just go get a cup of coffee or something
that they could focus on their kid
I think a lot of kids actually will come out of this
And kids are remarkably adaptable
They're remarkably adaptable
CA Heres a question from Mariusz
Could you give us some tips on how to discover our Why
SS Absolutely
I'll give you a little exercise that you can do with your friends
It's called the Friends Exercise
Find a friend you love and who loves you
The person who if they called you at three o'clock in the morning
you take the call and you know they would do the same for you
Do not do this with a sibling or a spouse
Do not do this with a parent
Those relationships are too close
Do it with a best friend
And go up to them and ask the simple question
Why are we friends
And they're going to look at you like you're crazy
because you're asking them to put into words a feeling
You're asking them to use a part of the brain the neocortex
that doesn't control feelings
and to put the thing that exists in the limbic brain into language
which it doesn't do
And so it's actually a very difficult question
They're going to say I don't know
It's not that they don't know it's that they can't put it into words
Ironically you stop asking the question why
and you start asking the question what because what is a rational question
What is it about me that I know that you would be there for me
no matter what
And they won't know how to answer it
They'll start describing you
I don't know you're funny I trust you
You've always been there for me
You play devil's advocate
Good That's the definition of a friend
What specifically is it about me
that I know you'd be there for me no matter what
And they'll continue to do the same
They'll keep trying to describe you You keep playing devil's advocate
You get the idea
Eventually they'll give up and they'll start describing themselves
And they'll say
and this is what my friend said to me when I did it with them
I don't know Simon I don't even have to talk to you
I could just sit in the same room as you and I feel inspired
And I got goosebumps I'm getting them right now
They will articulate the value you have in their life
and you will have some sort of emotional response
goosebumps or you'll well up
because what they're telling you is your Why
your Why is the thing you give to the world
You can do this with multiple friends and they will say almost exactly
if not the exact same thing because that is your Why
That is the thing you give to the world
So it may not give you exact language
but it will put you squarely in the ballpark for what your Why is
CA Here's an anonymous question
I have a friend who is currently struggling with depression
and he's just not like he used to be
I don't know what to say to him
He's actually annoyed by the question 'How are you doing'
How can I offer my help
SS So one of the things I learned by accident a couple of years ago
is sometimes statements work better than questions
Because questions people can avoid right
This is what we all did during COVID
How are you Fine Fine Everyone's fine right
And then what do you do with that
And so try making a statement right
Something's wrong
Something's different
You're not the same
I'm worried about you
Make statements
And it leaves very little room
for somebody to divert the conversation
You're not the person I know
And do it with love and empathy and the most important thing
don't show up to solve the problem
Especially when you're starting to have a difficult conversation
you don't show up to solve the problem
You show up to create an environment
in which they'd be willing to open up to you
That's the only goal
So try a statement instead of a question
CA So here's the last question I'm going to ask this for me
What do you mean Simon when you say that everyone is a leader
SS Leadership has nothing to do with rank or title
I know many people who sit at the highest levels of organizations
who are not leaders
We do as they tell us because they have authority over us
but we don't trust them and we wouldn't follow them
And yet I also know many people who sit at very low levels of organizations
that have no formal rank and no formal authority
and yet they've made the choice
to look after the person to the left of them
and the person to the right of them
and we would trust them and follow them anywhere
Leadership is the responsibility to see those around us rise
It's the responsibility to take care of those around us
That's what leadership is
It's not about being in charge
It's about taking care of those in our charge
And the only thing title and authority allow you to do
is lead with greater scale
Every single one of us has the opportunity to be the leader we wish we had
Every single one of us
CA Simon thank you so much for spending this time with us
SS Thanks Chris I really appreciate it
Take care of yourself Take care of each other

I spend most of my time talking and thinking and writing
about women's experiences in UK and US workplaces
particularly Black women's experiences
And so for me understanding the glass cliff 
the situation that underrepresented leaders find themselves in
when they take on leadership positions
only to find that their chances of success
have been limited before they even begin 
really was an eyeopener
Now I'm aware that for a lot of people
this might be the first time you're hearing about the glass cliff
And so I think the easiest way into the conversation
is by starting with the glass ceiling
that invisible but seemingly impossibletobreakthrough barrier
that sits above the heads of women in business
and stops them from reaching the absolute pinnacles
of their professional capabilities
We talk a lot about the glass ceiling being there
and what it's like to live and to work underneath it
But we don't really talk about what happens to those people
who do manage to break through
I feel like we maybe have this shared imagination
that if someone were able to break through the glass ceiling
it would be onwards and upwards from there the sky's the limit
But in reality that's not what often happens
because all too often when somebody does break through the glass ceiling
they find themselves in a new dangerous position
They find themselves teetering on the edge of the glass cliff
So I'm going to talk about underrepresented people a lot in this
and that can mean so many different things
to different people in different moments and different contexts
But I'm talking about those people who are most underrepresented
at the most senior levels of business
So that is women
and that's racially marginalized people 
essentially anybody who's not both white and male
And so the story often goes
that when underrepresented people take over a business
that business seems to start to fail
And that's really strange
and if that's true that's worth looking into
And so The Times newspaper did look into it
And they released an article with the headline
Women on the Board A Help or a Hindrance
And they said what I've just told you
that when women take over businesses at those most senior levels 
board member CEO 
that those businesses seem to find themselves in a moment of trouble
And so they concluded that women on the board were in fact
bad for business
And they were right
But just in one small way
In  other much bigger much more important ways
they were absolutely wrong
But we can start with where they were right
They were right that the research does show
that when underrepresented people do take on those most senior roles
that businesses do seem to be in a moment of trouble
But its not like  they want you to think 
It's not that we've you know stomped our way into boardrooms
only to look around and think
Oh God I don't know what I'm doing here
It's not that at all
But the reason you might think that
is that they haven't told you the beginning of the story
And the beginning of the story is what we need to understand
if we want to see what's stopping more people who aren't both white and male
from being successful when they take on leadership roles
So there's a piece of research from the University of Exeter
They looked at FTSE  companies
and when they appointed female leaders
those businesses were much more likely than average
to have already been in a consistent period
of five months of poor performance
And that poor performance can look like all kinds of things
It could be a reputational scandal
where the tarnish is likely to be passed on to the new leader
It could be a hit to market valuations or to profit
But whatever that was
these businesses were all much more likely than average
to have already been in a consistent period of poor performance
before that new leader was appointed
And this isn't a single piece of research
and it's not even limited to a single country
Researchers at the University of Utah did a really similar thing
but they didn't just look at the appointment of women
They looked at the appointment of women and racially marginalized men
And they looked at Fortune  companies over a year period 
so a huge data set 
and they found exactly the same
Those businesses that appointed underrepresented leaders
were much more likely than average
to already be in a period of poor performance
So maybe you're listening to this and you're thinking Well so what
So long as these people are getting an opportunity
why does it matter if the businesses aren't in perfect condition
before these people arrive
Well one of the reasons it matters
is the narrative that that pushes back to us
If an underrepresented person takes on a role
and their chances of being successful are limited before they even begin
if they do fail if they do fall off that cliff
the message that we get back is
Well of course they did
Someone like that  that's not the right kind of person
to run a successful business
And so that message compounds and we just internalize it
So I think all of this logically leads us to two questions
the first of which is
Why is this happening
Why are businesses that are in trouble
more likely to appoint an underrepresented leader
Well it could be that in patriarchal societies
women are viewed as caregivers as nurturers
and so research has shown that when a business is in trouble
women are often appointed to lead
not for their ability to make transformational change
but because of their perceived soft skills
for their ability to reengage that workforce
and to get them back motivated again
But importantly
because she's not hired for her ability to make transformational change
research shows that she's often not given the tools or the time necessary
to make that change
And so her chances of falling off that cliff
are increased before she even begins
because of the limitations of the imaginations
of the people who have brought her in
The second reason to paraphrase Kristin Anderson
who's a psychology professor at the University of Houston
is that in business women might be seen as more disposable more expendable
and that means they make really good scapegoats
In that case if your business isn't doing well
bringing in a female leader could be a real winwin scenario
If she comes in and is able to make that transformational change then great
your business is transformed
But if she's not
all of the blame is able to be put onto her shoulders
and she's able to get pushed out of the business
pushed over that cliff
Importantly the research then shows
that she's more likely than not to be replaced by a white man
a move known as the savior effect
And that savior effect signals to us to shareholders investors employees
that the business is back in a safe pair of hands
Its back to business as usual
And really importantly that new white male safe pair of hands
is more likely to be given both the tools and the time necessary
to succeed where the underrepresented person has failed
So up until now we've been talking about what happens
when you are a racially marginalized person
or a woman
But as I said the majority of my work looks at Black women
So what happens when we do take that more intersectional look
when we think about the experiences of people
with not just one but two marginalized identities
As you might imagine it's not the best story
If a new Black woman takes over the most senior role in the business 
board member CEO 
we can safely assume two things
The first thing that we can assume as we've discussed
is the business might not be in great shape
And the second thing that we can assume
is that she's likely to be managing a large team of white men
that leadership layer just below her
her closest cohort
And we can assume that because in 
the Lean In Foundation reported that white men make up about  percent
of that entrylevel junior cohort
But by the time we get to the Csuite
that's actually ballooned up to  percent
That means white men are the only group whose representation grows
as they become more senior
Or to put it a different way
they're the only group who experienced the opposite of the glass ceiling
Instead of looking up and not being able to see themselves reflected back at all
they look up and see nothing but themselves at the most senior levels
That is of course until they don't
until they have a new boss who's somebody like a Black woman
And the reason this matters is there's research from the University of Texas
and the University of Michigan
and they looked at what happens to that group of men
who are so used to seeing themselves directly mirrored back
when they get a new boss who doesn't mirror
both their whiteness and their maleness
And what they found was amazing
They found that as soon as they get a boss
who doesn't directly mirror them in both of those ways
they report feeling less personally connected to the business
less able to personally identify with it
and less personally invested in it
And that means that their work performance suffered
they did worse at their jobs
Now if a business is already in trouble
even the greatest leader is not going to solve it singlehandedly
She needs her team particularly her senior team
And so if they've stopped doing their jobs properly
all they're doing is continuing to push her towards the edge of that cliff
The second thing that same piece of research found was that
they stopped doing a really important part of any manager's job
and that's managing their teams
They stopped developing mentoring
working with the people who was their job to take care of
But they didn't stop doing that equally
No they mostly stopped helping working with developing
anyone in that team who was also racially marginalized
And so in that way the glass cliff bites twice
We're not only pushing the existing leader closer to the edge of their cliff
we're stopping what could be this new cohort of underrepresented leaders
from coming up
because we're not giving them the same support guidance mentorship development
that the rest of their colleagues are getting
So I'm telling you this because I want you to be a part of making this change
And that might sound impossible
You might be thinking
Well I can't change businesses or charities governments
any of the places where we see the glass cliff playing out
But  and stay with me for a second 
you can because none of those things are real
Businesses government charities  all of these things
are just groups of people who've come together to do something
And we're a group of people who have come together to do something
and so we can make that change
We can look at our own conscious and unconscious biases
and we can decide that we see the value in all people all of the time
not just some people
when we have a problem that they might be able to solve
or something that we might be able to blame them for
So as Angela Davis says
we have to  act as though [its possible to change] the world
And you have to do it all of the time
And so that's what I'm asking you to do
I'm asking you to look at yourself
and to decide that you are not going to be part of pushing anybody else
closer towards the edge of their own cliff
And I want you to know that I'm going to be right alongside you
trying to do the same

Microbes are everywhere
They live in the air the ocean
the soil and on our bodies lots of them
But before you reach for the hand sanitizer
take a look at these beautiful bacterial mats
in Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring
Theyre absolutely amazing
because theyve somehow figured out  how to grow happily
at near boiling temperatures
Ever since life on Earth began probably in a place like this
microbes have kept planetary chemical cycles in balance
Today humans are altering that balance and changing the climate
by emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
But microbes might be able to help us with our climate problem
After all microbes are Earth's original and most adaptable inhabitants
Now I know that not everyone is so enamored with microbes
My biology students tell me that they usually think of pathogen
when they hear the word microbe
and I know we're in the middle of a global viral pandemic
But you should keep in mind that far less than one percent of microbial diversity
is actually pathogenic to humans
In fact most of the microbes we encounter are beneficial
There are trillions of bacteria fungi and viruses
living in and on us right now
more of them than human cells in the body
They help us digest our food protect us from disease
and maybe even choose our mates
Microbiologists call this assemblage of tiny interlopers the human microbiome
We now know that there are microbiomes in basically every environment
In the same way that they help our human bodies stay healthy
microbiomes in water soil and air are critical for planetary health
For example cyanobacteria in the ocean carry out photosynthesis
and provide a large fraction of the planet's breathable oxygen
Even though they're tiny
their green color can be seen from outer space with satellites
They may be harder to see
but microbiomes in the soil are just as important
as the human or ocean microbiome
I think about soil as a skin for the planet
that provides nutrients to sustain crops and other plants
As an ecologist and climate scientist
I've been studying the microbes that live in soil for  years now
Just like we've seen with the human microbiome
cuttingedge techniques in molecular biology
especially DNA sequencing
show that soil microbiomes are extremely diverse
in their genes and life cycles
Scientists are starting to figure out how we can harness
the diversity of these often invisible organisms
to solve global problems like climate change and food insecurity
Take agricultural crops for example
With climate change causing more frequent heat waves and droughts
crop plants may become stressed
reducing yields and threatening food security
But microbes can help
There are symbiotic fungi called mycorrhiza
that grow out from plant roots and into the soil
where they collect water and nutrients
Then the plant and its symbiotic fungus make a trade
The fungus sends water and nutrients into the plant roots
and the plant pays back the fungus with sugars from photosynthesis
To reduce stress on plants from climate change
farmers can inoculate the soil with these beneficial fungi
Land managers are also starting to use the same approach
to help native plants recolonize degraded soil
during habitat restoration
So the next time you support an environmental cause
maybe through a nonprofit donation or volunteer work
remember soil microbes need conservation too
The planet also relies on soil microbiomes for other essential services
Have you ever thought about what happens to living things
like these leaves mosses and mushrooms when they die
I'm not talking about an existential crisis
I'm talking about microbial decomposition
Think about it like a type of biological recycling
practiced by very diligent microbes
They take dead bodies and turn them into useful nutrients
Without this essential service
life on Earth would grind to a halt
because dead stuff would pile up
depriving the next generation of life forms of the raw materials
needed for growth
Hundreds of researchers funded by the US Department of Energy
are even trying to figure out how to coopt microbial decomposition
to produce sustainable biofuels
from wood grasses and other plant materials
Fuels derived from plants and microbes are part of the climate solution
because they don't rely on fossil carbon sources
like coal and oil
At the same time ecologists like me are very concerned
about how climate change might affect microbial recycling in the environment
A warming climate might speed up the process
and release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
A drier climate might slow down the microbes
and leave plants starved for essential nutrients
Fortunately there is reason for hope
Microbes are super adaptable because they can evolve very quickly
For example you may have heard of pathogenic bacteria like staph
evolving antibiotic resistance
Of course that's bad for us
But the same evolutionary process
could also help microbes adapt to climate change which is good
After all microbes evolved long ago
to survive extreme conditions like the hot springs of Yellowstone
Just like our human cells each microbial cell contains a genome
And just like our genomes
microbial genomes contain genes or DNA sequences
with instructions for growth and survival
My colleagues and I have identified genes
that allow bacteria and fungi to survive drought
and decompose dead plant material
We're currently doing experiments to see how fast these genes evolve
and what kinds of genetic changes
make bacteria and fungi more resistant to drought
Some of our prior research shows that microbes have the potential
to deal with climate change
Microbiomes and the services they provide could cope not just by evolving
but also by shifting around the dominant species of microbes
Microbiomes are so diverse
that even if some of the species die out with climate change
others might survive and take their place allowing nature's recycling to continue
To test this idea my colleagues and I designed special cages
to contain microbiomes
from different habitats in Southern California
We sampled microbiomes from places
ranging from forested mountaintops
to hot deserts
Each cage contained a microbiome from one of these places
along with sterilized dead grass for the microbes to use as a food source
We then put the cages back into the different habitats
so that the microbiomes experienced pretty dramatic changes in climate
We expected that the microbes from the cooler places
would die out when we moved them to the warm places like the hot desert
and that they would lose their ability
to consume and recycle the nutrients in the dead grass material
But when we looked at the results
I was really shocked
The microbiomes were almost unfazed by this massive climate difference
There were some changes in the dominant species
but mountaintop microbes decomposed dead grass just as well
as desert microbiomes in the hot dry climate
This result tells us the microbiomes have the ability to evolve
and shift to deal with really dramatic climate changes
Another way that soil microbiomes can be part of the climate change solution
is by building healthy soil
Many soil bacteria and fungi ooze out sticky chemicals
to glue themselves onto soil surfaces
The glue and the microbes
form these biofilms that hold soil particles together
This helps the soil resist erosion
and hold more water that's available for plants
Microbes and their biofilms also play a big role in soil carbon sequestration
Many forms of carbon from plants like sugars don't last long in the soil
because they're food for many organisms including the microbes
But microbodies and biofilms are made up of complex chemicals
For example many microbes build cell walls for protection
so the wall material has to be resistant to biochemical attack
When the microbes die their corpses especially those cell walls
can stick around for a really long time maybe even thousands of years
In this way soil acts a lot like a bank vault for carbon
More carbon in the bank means healthier soil
and less greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere
Microbes are sort of like the Federal Reserve
They can take cash off the street in the form of these plant sugars
and lock it away in a chemical vault for longterm storage
With the science of climate change becoming more and more obvious every day
we need to figure out how to adapt for sure
Some scary outcomes like emerging microbial diseases
are definitely something we need to plan for
But microbes can be a part of the climate solution
if we figure out how to leverage all that microbiome diversity
To be honest though making sense out of complex microbiomes
is still a big scientific challenge
Their complexity is both a blessing and a curse
We're only beginning to understand
all the strange and wonderful microbial lifestyles
that have been evolving since the origins of life on Earth
This digital artwork called Microbes Reimagined
does a great job of capturing that sense of mystery
But one thing we do know for sure is that microbes are not just pathogens
Our lives literally depend on them
So next time you take a breath outside
imagine all those oxygenspewing cyanobacteria
floating around in the ocean
and when the time comes
and you draw in that last and final breath
take comfort in knowing that soil microbes will be there
to turn your body into useful nutrients
Even as we enjoy these benefits of microbiomes
climate change remains a potentially existential threat to our wellbeing
But dangerous climate change is not inevitable at least not yet
With the right cuttingedge research
diverse microbiomes could become a big part of the solution
to our climate problem
Thank you

Im Dr Jen Gunter
I'm an OBGYN and as a doctor
I do my best to keep people healthy and informed about their bodies
And I do this with science
Science helps us understand our bodies and how to take care of them
It's also our greatest weapon
in the battle against medical misinformation
And there's a lot of misinformation out there
In Body Stuff
my new podcast from the TED Audio Collective
I'm going to use the power of science to take down the stickiest medical myths
and explain how our bodies really work
Guest  The only thing these cleanses and detox remove from your body
is your money
Guest  There aren't superfoods there's just foods
Jen Gunter And medical myths
Well they're sneaky villains
They take science and twist it to make their marketing sound scienceish
Guest  If you tell people that it's all about the science
then people are more likely to believe it
JG They prey on our fears and anxieties
Guest  You have toxins building up in your blood
You have toxins building up in your colon
JG None of us are entirely immune to their lies
And when you put medical myths under a microscope
you see they're about more than just distorting science to sell stuff
They're also about taking advantage of the gaps in medicine
Guest  Doctors often come in with I want to say commonsense racism
Guest  This is actually a purifier It's a medical ritual
No this is in essence a religious ritual
Guest  Celebrity culture helped to make pseudoscience a big business
JG And medical myths underestimate how brilliant
and amazing our bodies really are
Guest  It works like an exquisitely designed atomic balance machine
Guest  It's really powerful actually
that a talking form of therapy can do all this
Guest  It's just incredible that all this happens
with our not even knowing about it

Two frogs are minding their own business in the swamp when WHAM
theyre kidnapped
They come to in a kitchen  captives of a menacing chef
He boils up a pot of water  and lobs one of the frogs in
But its having none of this
The second its toes hit the scalding water it jumps right out the window
The chef refills the pot but this time  he doesnt turn on the heat
He plops the second frog in and this frogs okay with that
The chef turns the heat on very low  and the temperature of water slowly rises
So slowly that the frog doesnt notice
In fact it basks in the balmy water
Only when the surface begins to bubble does the frog realize its toast
Whats funny about this parable is that its not scientifically true for frogs
In reality a frog will detect slowly heating water and leap to safety
Humans on the other hand are a different story
Were perfectly happy to sit in the pot  and slowly turn up the heat
all the while insisting it isnt our hand on the dial
arguing about whether we can  trust thermometers
and questioning  even if theyre right does it matter
It does
Since  global average temperatures  have risen by  degree Celsius
That may not sound like a lot but it is
Why  degree is an average
Many places have already gotten much warmer than that
Some places in the Arctic  have already warmed  degrees
If global average temperatures  increase  more degree
the coldest nights in the Arctic might get  degrees warmer
The warmest days in Mumbai  might get  degrees hotter
So how did we get here
Almost everything that makes modern life possible relies on fossil fuels
coal oil and gas full of carbon  from ancient organic matter
When we burn fossil fuels
we release carbon dioxide  that builds up in our atmosphere
where it remains for hundreds  or even thousands of years
letting heat in but not out
The heat comes from sunlight which passes through the atmosphere to Earth
where it gets absorbed  and warms everything up
Warm objects emit infrared radiation which should pass back out into space
because most atmospheric gases  dont absorb it
But greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane
do absorb infrared wavelengths
So when we add more of those gases  to the atmosphere
less heat makes it back out to space  and our planet warms up
If we keep emitting greenhouse gases  at our current pace
scientists predict temperatures will rise  degrees
from their preindustrial levels by 
Theyve identified  degrees of warming
global averages half a degree warmer  than todays
as a threshold beyond which  the negative impacts of climate change
will become increasingly severe
To keep from crossing that threshold
we need to get our greenhouse gas  emissions down to zero
as fast as possible
Or rather we have to get emissions down to what's called net zero
meaning we may still be putting some greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
but we take out as much as we put in
This doesnt mean we can just keep  emitting and sequester all that carbon
we couldnt keep up with our emissions  through natural methods
and technological solutions would be prohibitively expensive
and require huge amounts of permanent storage
Instead while we switch  from coal oil and natural gas
to clean energy and fuels  which will take time
we can mitigate the damage by removing carbon from the atmosphere
Jumping out of the proverbial pot  isnt an option
but we can do something the frogs cant
reach over and turn down the heat

As of  the worlds biggest  lithiumion battery
is hooked up to the Southern California  power grid
and can provide  million watts  of power
or enough to power about  homes
But its actually not the biggest battery in the world
these lakes are
Wait how can a pair of lakes  be a battery
To answer that question  it helps to define a battery
its simply something that stores energy and releases it on demand
The lithiumion batteries that power  our phones laptops and cars
are just one type
They store energy in lithium ions
To release the energy the ions  are separated from their electrons
then rejoined at the other end  of the battery
as a new molecule with lower energy
How do the two lakes  store and release energy
First one is  meters higher  than the other
Electricity powers pumps that move billions of liters of water
from the lower lake to the higher one
This stores the energy by giving the water extra gravitational potential energy
Then when theres high demand for electricity
valves open releasing the stored energy  by letting water flow downhill
to power  giant turbines that can  generate  billion watts of power
for  hours
Were going to need more and more  giant batteries
Thats because right now generating enough electricity to power the world
produces an unsustainable amount  of greenhouse gas
 billion tons per year
Well need to get that number  down to netzero
But many clean energy sources  cant produce electricity 
So to make the switch we need a way to store the electricity until it's needed
That means we need gridscale batteries
batteries big enough  to power multiple cities
Unfortunately neither of the giant batteries weve talked about so far
can solve this problem
The two lakes setup requires specific geography takes up a lot of land
and has high upfront costs to build
The giant lithiumion battery in California meanwhile
can power about  homes yes but only for an hour
Lithiumion batteries are great for things that dont use a lot of power
But to store a lot of energy  they have to be huge and heavy
Thats why electric planes arent a thing
the best electric plane  can only carry two people
for about  kilometers on one charge
or its batteries would be too heavy  to fly
A typical commercial jet can carry  people over  km before refueling
Lithiumion batteries also require  certain heavy metals to make
These resources are limited and mining them often causes environmental damage
Inventors all over the world are rising  to the challenge
of making batteries that can meet  our needs
many of them even weirder  than the two lakes
One company is building  a skyscraper battery
When the sun is shining  a crane powered by solar energy
piles blocks on top of each other  in a tower
At night the cranes let gravity pull the blocks down
and use the resulting power  to spin generators
Though there have been some early setbacks
another promising approach involves heating up salts until they melt
The molten salt can be stored until  theres a high demand for electricity
then used to boil water
The steam can power turbines that generate electricity
Another idea biobatteries made  from paper powered by bacteria
and activated by spit
Bacteria release energy in the form  of electrons when they metabolize glucose
and at least one species of bacteria can transfer those electrons
outside its cells completing a circuit
While these batteries wont power a city or even a house
they don't have the waste and cost concerns of traditional batteries
From vast mountain lakes  to microscopic bacteria
from seawater batteries that bypass the need for heavy metals
to nuclear batteries that power deep space missions
we're constantly rethinking what a battery can be
The next unlikely battery could be hiding in plain sight
just waiting to be discovered  and help us achieve a sustainable future

Theyve passed every test cleared every hurdle jumped through every hoop
Now all that remains is to unleash  them on the world
But wait whats this
Ah yes theres one more challenge  They must now across the valley of death
All new products must pass through  here before they reach the market
Many never make it out  and sometimes thats OK
if they dont work dont fill a need  or for any number of other reasons
But inventions that could help address massive global issues also face this risk
Thats because a technologys potential isnt the only factor
that determines whether it will succeed
The valley of death is especially risky  for innovations
involving complex physical objects  as opposed to software
and for those in highly regulated industries
like medicine building materials  and transportation
Regulations and other obstacles  arent inherently bad
theyre often designed to keep people safe
but they do tend to scare off investors
and thats what traps good ideas  in the valley of death
their funding dries up before  they can become profitable
One of the fields where this problem  is most pressing today
is zerocarbon technologies
Theyre essential to our future
because they will help us eliminate  greenhouse gas emissions
and stabilize our climate
But they also have features that make  them particularly vulnerable
in the valley of death
Lets look at why that is  and how we can change it
All new technologies must go  through a development phase
before they can become profitable
For zerocarbon technologies
the costs of this phase are high the timelines are long
and in spite of the good they can do
demand is often low because they can  require big changes
in both infrastructure  and consumer behavior
For example electric heat pumps dont burn fossil fuels and
when you factor in savings on energy use
are costcompetitive with gas furnaces
but homeowners only change their heating and cooling systems every few decades
Direct air capture technologies  meanwhile
remove CO directly from the atmosphere
We need these technologies  to reach our emissions goals
and several of them have already been proven to work
but theyre at risk of getting trapped  in the valley of death
because they're expensive
This creates a vicious cycle because  the best way to lower costs
is by well practicing  making more of a product and refining it
But high initial costs  scare off investors
and without their money
companies cant continue to develop  their technologies
and can't ultimately decrease costs
Fortunately theres a way to break this cycle
governments can help close the gap
when private investors wont fund technologies
with such a high potential  for social benefit
This isnt just theoretical
in the s  functioning solar panels existed
but werent widely adopted  because of their cost
To change this Germany offered government loans to companies creating solar panels
and legally obligated utility companies
to buy electricity produced  using renewable energy
The US and China followed suit  by financing major solar panel projects
The cost of solar has dropped  almost  since 
making it much easier to adopt
A similar thing happened for wind energy
during the oil crisis of the s Denmark invested in wind power
and started taxing winds  fossil fuelbased competitors
Other countries took similar steps
and as more wind power was generated worldwide
the costs of this technology dropped dramatically
These success stories tell us  that government initiatives work
initiatives like boosting spending  on research and development
offering tax and loan incentives  to startups
that want to develop  zerocarbon technologies
and consumers who want to buy them and putting a price on carbon emissions
We need governments to do what they did for solar and wind
for many more innovations
At the end of the day  ideas and inventions alone
cant solve our most daunting problems
policies and markets have to be shaped
so the most promising technologies can succeed

Here in this abundant forest
Malassezia is equipped with everything  it could ever need
Feasting constantly its in paradise
But wait whats this
In fact Malassezia is a type of yeast  that lives and dines on all of our scalps
And in about half of the human population its activity causes dandruff
So why do some people have more dandruff than others
And how can it be treated
We might consider ourselves individuals but were really colonies
Our skin hosts billions of microbes
Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home on our skin shortly after were born
Follicles the tiny cavities that grow hairs all over our body
make for especially popular  living quarters
Malassezia are fond of these hideouts because they contain glands
that secrete an oil called sebum
thats thought to lubricate  and strengthen our hair
Malassezia evolved to consume  our skins proteins and oils
And because of its many sebumsecreting  follicles
our scalp is one of the oiliest places on our body
and consequently one of the yeastiest
As these fungi feast on our scalps oils dandruff may form
This is because sebum is composed of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
Saturated fats neatly pack together
Unsaturated fats on the other hand
contain double bonds that create  an irregular kink in their structure
Malassezia eat sebum by secreting an enzyme
that releases all of the oils  fatty acids
But they only consume the saturated fats leaving the unsaturated ones behind
These irregularly shaped leftovers soak into the skin and pry its barrier open
allowing water to escape
The body detects these breaches  and responds defensively
causing the inflammation  that gives dandruff its itch
It also makes the skin cells proliferate to repair the damaged barrier
Usually our skins outer surface  or epidermis
completely renews itself  every two to three weeks
Epidermal cells divide  move outwards die
and form the skins tough outer layer
which gradually sheds off in single cells  far too small to see
But with dandruff cells churn out quickly to correct the broken barrier
meaning they dont mature  and differentiate properly
Instead they form large greasy clumps around the hair follicle
that are shed as visible flakes
This is how Malassezias  voracious appetite
and our bodies reaction  to its byproducts lead to dandruff
Currently the most effective way to get rid of dandruff
is by using antifungals  in things like shampoos
applied directly to the scalp  to kill Malassezia
For those who experience dandruff
it usually comes and goes as sebum secretions vary throughout one's lifetime
due to hormonal changes
But despite the fact that Malassezia  colonize everyone to a similar extent
not everyone gets dandruff
Some people are more susceptible
Exactly why is unclear
Do people with dandruff have a certain  genetic predisposition
Is their skin barrier more permeable
Scientists are currently investigating  if people with dandruff do in fact
lose more water through their scalps
and whether this is whats leading  their skin cells to proliferate
Researchers are learning that Malassezia communicate with our immune system
using small oily molecules called  oxylipins that regulate inflammation
If they can find a way to inhibit inflammatory oxylipins
and boost antiinflammatory ones  they could develop new treatments
Scientists are also investigating  if theres any benefit to our relationship
with Malassezia
They hypothesize that dandruff
which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing for us
creates a reliable oily  food source for the yeast
But dandruff isnt contagious  or a great threat to our health
And Malassezia seem to excel at defending their territory our skin
from other more harmful microbes like Staphylococcus aureus
So while scientists have gotten  to the bottom of many mysteries
surrounding this condition it must be said
dandruff remains a headscratcher

In college sports American universities are exploiting disproportionately
Black athletes
for billions of dollars
while diminishing their education health and safety
Let me start with a bit of history
In November 
an undersized quarterback from Boston College named Doug Flutie
threw a gamewinning touchdown pass against the defending national champions
University of Miami
As the Hail Mary pass floated through the fall air
in front of a packed stadium
millions more watched with excitement on TV
After the dramatic win
undergraduate application rates at Boston College shot up by  percent
revealing to universities the enormous marketing value
of building highprofile sports programs
That same year the United States Supreme Court heard a case
in which the Universities of Georgia and Oklahoma
challenged rules that limited the number of football games they could play on TV
Those schools saw the opportunity to not only make money
by televising their games
but to also market their universities to the world
The Supreme Court agreed that the broadcasting restrictions were illegal
and schools began to negotiate TV deals worth millions
That case opened the floodgates to money in college athletics
and with it evergrowing conflicts of interest
that prioritize sports over education
promote wins over health and safety
and reinforce the disturbing racial and economic inequities in our country
Since then the growth in college sports has been extraordinary
and schools have earned record revenues year after year
The spending during that same time period
has increased at almost the same dramatic pace
as universities engage in an arms race to the top of the rankings
Massive expenditures on new stadiums bigger staffs and record salaries
have made it appear on the books at least
that athletic departments are losing money
while they build lavish facilities
and make multimillionaires out of coaches and administrators
In fact in  out of  states
the highestpaid public employee is now a college football or basketball coach
Meanwhile college athletes whose elite talents generate these massive revenues
are not only denied the ability to share in the riches they create
too many of them are not given the education they're promised either
Today college athletes are exploited to the tune of almost  billion dollars
That's how much money is generated by college sports each year
And I'm all too familiar with the exploitation
because I used to be responsible for enforcing it
Following my own college baseball career at the University of Dayton
I went on to law school before becoming an investigator
at the National Collegiate Athletic Association
I traveled to college campuses across the country
and helped enforce a page rule book that denies athletes the right to get paid
for their performance
or even profit from their own name
For instance unlike the music student who in addition to their scholarship
can get paid to record a song
or the English student who in addition to their scholarship
can get paid to write a book
college athletes cannot profit from their talents
or even take a free meal
without being ruled ineligible and risking their scholarship
During my time as an investigator
I questioned hundreds of athletes and their families
about their financial transactions
dug through their personal bank and phone records
and scrutinized their relationships to a humiliating degree
all for the possibility that someone gave them something beyond a scholarship
no matter how petty
In one case I questioned Ohio State football players
who received free tattoos and cash in exchange for memorabilia
The case received national attention and became known as Tattoo Gate
as if it were a scandal on par with political espionage
The players were suspended and had to repay the cash
as well as the value of the tattoos
In effect unpaid athletes were fined by a billiondollar organization
that gets paid by sponsors to decorate the athletes in corporate logos
I was told my job was to promote fairness but there was nothing fair about that
Shortly thereafter I left the NCAA and started fighting for the athletes
It became increasingly clear to me
that rules supposedly designed to prevent exploitation
instead allow a collection of universities and their wealthy corporate sponsors
to profit off the athletes
who are promised an education and lured by a chance at the pros
but who too often end up with nothing
Now some people believe college athletes get a free ride
However there is nothing free about risking health and safety
while working  to  hours per week
as you fight to keep your scholarship
In football alone
there are over  injuries a year
including  knee injuries and  spinal injuries
Since  forty players have died
Beyond football a recent study revealed
that an estimated  percent of Division  college athletes
suffer a major injury in their career
and over half of them endure chronic conditions
that last well beyond their playing days
There is nothing free about that
especially as the NCAA refuses to enforce health and safety standards
and has denied in court it even has that responsibility
And about that education they're promised 
according to the College Sports Research Institute
Black football and basketball players in the top five conferences
graduate at  and  percent lower
than the undergraduate population
Those who do graduate are often shuffled into majors with watereddown courses
that conform to their athletic schedules to simply keep them eligible
The time demands and required focus on sports
makes it challenging for even the most wellintentioned athlete
to get a meaningful education
This is unacceptable for a  dollar billion industry
run by institutions whose mission is to educate young people
Although plenty of athletes succeed
their achievements don't require rules that deny pay
or a system that limits educational opportunities
or neglects health and safety
The fact is
American universities oversee a multibilliondollar entertainment industry
that denies fundamental rights to its essential workers
a disproportionate number of whom are Black
while making millionaires of largely white coaches and administrators
This dynamic has not only deprived many young people of a meaningful education
it has shifted generations of wealth away from mostly Black families
and represents the systemic inequities plaguing our society
The good news is that people are starting to see the truth
The NCAA's own public polling
has revealed that a staggering  percent of the public
believe that colleges put money ahead of their athletes
State and federal lawmakers both Republican and Democrat
have also taken notice and started to act
Several US senators have rightly described the problems in college sports
as a civil rights issue
Meanwhile college athletes from across the country
have started to stand up to demand greater health and safety protections
representation rights
attention to racial and social justice issues
and economic fairness
Those who think the players should just stick to sports
fail to recognize how rarely college athletes speak up
and ignore the great personal risk they take
in confronting a powerful industry
especially without any representation
More importantly critics fail to acknowledge
that college athletes are simply seeking rights
that are afforded to virtually everyone else in this country
and basic protections that shouldn't even be in question
I agree that college sports should be an enjoyable distraction
but not when they're distracting us from the very injustice they enable
In his retirement
the NCAA's first and longestserving executive director Walter Byers
described college sports as
the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today's campus executives
This is a telling quote from the man who designed this system
and the one who knew it best
But you don't have to be an insider
to recognize the exploitation of young people
You don't have to be a Republican or a Democrat
to be troubled by the irresponsible spending or the disregard for values
at our universities
You don't even have to be a sports fan
You just have to believe in basic ideas of fairness
and the values of higher education
So let's require that all college athletes
are given a chance at a meaningful education
Let's demand responsible spending by our universities
and fairly allocate the billions of dollars being generated
Let's create robust health and safety standards
to protect those who entertain us with their bodies
and enforce those standards
Let's provide college athletes with a representative body
so they have recourse when things go wrong
and a voice about how to make things right
Finally let's rise to the challenge of our time
and once and for all correct
the persistent racial and economic inequities
that apply to college sports and beyond
Change is long overdue
but there has never been a better time than now

Cloe Shasha Brooks Hello welcome
You are watching a TED interview series
called How to Deal with Difficult Feelings
Im Cloe Shasha Brooks your host and a curator at TED
And today we'll be focusing specifically on anxiety
So first I'll be speaking with author and model Naomi Shimada
about the anxiety associated with social media
She coauthored a book called Mixed Feelings
Exploring the emotional impact of our digital habits
It's all about how the internet has created a new layer
of perfectionist pressure on our lives
and how we can better manage our relationship with our online worlds
Hello Naomi Great to see you
Naomi Shimada Hello Cloe great to see you too
I'm honored to be here
CSB Oh well thanks for joining us
So Naomi you have written and spoken
about the relationship between social media and anxiety a whole bunch
such as the anxiety to post online or not to post
So can you tell us a little bit more about that
NS So I always want to start by saying even though I have written about it
I still don't really feel like an expert because this is just 
I always want to decenter my voice as an expert
because I'm just feeling this out like everyone else
But in my experience
social media and anxiety are connected
you know or social media exacerbates anxious feelings
It exacerbates the human condition
And so things that we may have insecurities and anxieties around
like you know our relationships our bodies our work
the things that make up our sense of self
I think the anxiety we feel
or we can feel when we use social media can sometimes act as a marker
for things that show us where we need to do work
or where we feel insecure
And sometimes it's just a message being reflected back to us
And also like I said social media exacerbates the human condition
You know as humans
I think we so often just want to be loved and cared for and seen and adored
or just acknowledged
So social media has also become you know our main mode of communication
our method of work
Some of those things those lines can start to become very blurred
CSB Absolutely
Yeah and in addition to making lives look shiny and perfect
social media also seems to fuel a lot of FOMO or fear of missing out
And I'm curious what you'd suggest for people who experience
a lot of anxiety from seeing videos and images
of other people having a ton of fun and
you know not knowing how to deal with that
NS I think like I said slightly earlier
the feelings of anxiety when they come up
like what is that message you know
taking that step back and being like why do I feel this way
Why is this making me feel like this
And kind of reading into it
And in my personal experience
the thing that works for me
is just taking a step back taking a moment
you know if something is making me feel bad
for example if social media 
if we thought of it as a substance for example
if something was making you feel bad what would you do about it
Would you stop using it
You know I think there's levels to this because sometimes you know
we may have work now that is so intertwined with social media
and it can't just be like oh stop using it
And I know that there's a spectrum
And I'm also navigating this constantly myself
when as a publicfacing person
my job is so intertwined with social media
and it's something I want to do less and less
So I'm navigating that kind of boundary for me all the time
So it's just negotiating
sometimes it's not as clear cut you know
it may for you start as take the weekends off or you know
I actually personally most of the time don't have social media on my phone
And just when I have to do something for work
that's when I interact with it
especially this year that's been so heavy you know
and where there is no off button
and every new day bringing such bad news
like I'm a very sensitive person
so I have to do the things I know that I need to take care of myself
which is not scroll
Also I've had an injury in my hand
which means I can't actually scroll
so I'm like This is a sign
I'm just not supposed to be interacting like that right now
So just listening and knowing
that you don't have to fall under the pressure
Like I think so often we think that if we don't post
we don't exist
Our existence you know 
we only exist when other people see us existing
Like that that whole line like
Oh if you didn't post about it it didn't happen
That concept
We've started to internalize you know
especially my generation of millennials genZ
like if you didn't post it it didn't happen
And so it's just like going back and being like OK is that true
Why do I feel the need to share this
And asking those questions
And that's what I do
So like I said I'm not an expert
I too I'm working this out and every day feels totally different
But asking those questions is a great place to start
CSB Thank you for that
So we have a question from the audience
Let's bring that up
OK so related to this from Facebook
What question should we be asking ourselves
before we post on social media
NS So I like to ask myself like why do I want to share this right now
Is this something 
as a person that has grown up on the internet on social media
so often how I validated myself and my sense of self
was posting something and people reacting to it
And I think that's just very murky territory
I think like you know
why do I feel the need to share this
Is this something that feels also private to me
You know in my opinion on whether
and I guess you know I have not the biggest social media following
but a social media following
that sometimes when I'm like does that person for me
does my family member want to be shown online for example
like or is this a private moment
I think navigating like do I feel not good about myself right now
and is posting a picture of myself looking like hot
or whatever the equivalent of looking really happy 
I think sometimes so often we post about the things that we are yearning for
whether that's attention love craving
And I think there's deeper underlying messages
behind posting sometimes you know
and that it is a projection of the things that we want in our lives
for example posting photos of people you want better relationships with
or you know
there's a big spectrum of experience
But for me I just try to ask myself
why do I feel the need to make this public right now
Is this something that I am proud of
And it's no critique
This is really questions that are just a gauge where I'm at
or where someone else is at with it
Like is this something that actually
I just need to pay attention to in my own life privately
of like this is something I should be working on or thinking about
or there's just deeper questions about context
I think that are important
CSB Yeah yeah
And I think as we're now at our final question
which is something that I think is related to what you're saying
around when to post or not to post
but from a different angle which is you know
a lot of people have anxiety about whether or not to post
their social justice activism on their accounts
and regardless of the activism they might be already doing
outside of social media right
And some people just find it performative
But at the same time there was a fear of looking apathetic
if people are not posting about social justice on social media
So how do you suggest people deal with that anxiety
and think about that
NS I mean that's definitely an anxiety of our generation right
Anxieties around posting about social justice
I think the big question here is asking ourselves like
what am I doing in my own life
You know and again there is a spectrum
because there's a lot of people
who are sharing a lot of important information via social media
So you have like organizers and then everybody else
But if you are 
Once again you know I can't speak for everybody
but just I think it's 
I read this quote by an activist in Oregon
a lifetime organizer called Grace Lee Boggs
and she said that you know that a lot of times in our lives
we don't prioritize the importance of selfreflection and revolution
And I think you know we so care about optics
We don't want people to think that we are racists sizeist sexist etc
But to not create and redo this kind of harm in the world
we need to understand and really reflect
on these systems that we've all internalized to some effect
So to understand like where am I on the spectrum
How do I benefit
All of these things actually really take time and deep you know
selfreflection and work
And that kind of questioning I think
is something that I find it helpful to be offline
because I'm like otherwise I'm just listening
to what everybody else is saying
Like are these my thoughts and my feelings
or am I just internalizing
what other people are just shouting into the atmosphere
and into the internet
I think there's moments where obviously
a lot the uprisings in June would not have happened
if it wasn't for the information that was shared
and that action of course was so important
But I think there's different phases you know
And when it's just about shame and optics
that's not how we change the world
For us to change the world
we need to inhabit and act on these reflections
So I think there are again more questions to ask ourselves like
do I just not want people to think that I do this
And often we are in echo chamber of the people who follow us
and people we follow right
So a lot of the times we're just sharing and shouting
into the atmosphere of people who have the same ideals as us
And that energy can be used in a different way
And also sometimes inhibits I think real harder conversations from happening
because I think social media isn't often an intimate enough of a space
to be able to ask each other questions that we're afraid to ask
Or mistakes it's not favorable to making mistakes anymore
which is my critique and sadness about social media
You know our biggest fear is being called out for something
But this callout culture sometimes not always
I understand its role and place in society
but sometimes doesn't allow for us
to have more engaged conversations around these systems
that we've internalized
And we all make mistakes and we all have to learn
and sometimes it doesn't allow for that to happen
CSB Yeah yeah yeah
Well I think that's beautifully said
and we've come to the end of our time here
But I am so grateful to you for this conversation Naomi
and thank you for sharing all this
I'll talk to you soon Take care
NS Thank you Cloe and everyone
Much love

A few years ago
a student came up to me after the second day of my class
on parenting and child development
She hesitated for a second and then she confessed
I'm really interested in this material
but I was hoping your class would help me to become a better parent
if I have kids someday
She was disappointed
We were going to talk about how parents do not have control
in shaping who their children become
She jumped to the conclusion that my class wouldn't help her
I was caught off guard
Would confronting the science of parenting and child development
not be relevant to being a good parent
I hope that my class changed her mind
Parents want what's best for their children
young and old parents
rich and poor
married and divorced
And parenting books promise to show how to achieve the best outcomes
to address the difficult decisions that parents face every day
and in the process to reveal why each of us turned out the way we did
The problem is that parenting books send conflicting messages
Tiger parenting or freerange parenting
Parent like the Dutch to raise the happiest kids in the world
or like the Germans to raise selfreliant children
The one consistent message is that if your child isn't succeeding
you're doing something wrong
There's good news though
The science supports a totally different message
that is ultimately empowering
Trying to predict how a child will turn out
based on choices made by the parents
is like trying to predict a hurricane
from the flap of a butterfly's wings
Do you know the butterfly
the proverbial one that flaps its wings in China
perturbing the atmosphere just enough to shift wind currents
that make their way to the skies over tropical white beaches
intensifying the water evaporating from the ocean in a spiral of wind
and fueling a hurricane in the Caribbean
six weeks after that flutter of wings
If you are a parent
you are the butterfly flapping your wings
Your child is the hurricane a breathtaking force of nature
You will shape the person your child becomes
like the butterfly shapes the hurricane
in complex seemingly unpredictable but powerful ways
The hurricane wouldn't exist without the butterfly
Wait you might ask
what about all the successful parents with successful children
or the struggling parents with struggling children
They might seem to show the simple power of parenting
But children can be shaped by many forces that are often intertwined
like successful parents successful genes
successful peers
and a culture of success that they grow up in
This can make it hard to know which forces influence who children become
OK you might think
yes it's hard to pull apart all these possible forces
but we can make pretty good guesses about the importance of parents
Perhaps
Well how many of you know how a bicycle works
Right you've seen people riding bikes
maybe you've ridden one yourself
or even tried to teach someone else how to do it
Just like parenting 
you've seen people doing it
maybe you've done it yourself
or even tried to teach someone else how to do it
We can feel confident about what we know
When we say we know how a bicycle works
we think we have something in our heads like this
Something that relates the pedals to the chain and to the wheels
But when you ask people to explain how a bicycle works
they produce drawings like this
And like this
Laughter
People have no idea how bicycles work
Or zippers or rainbows
or even topics they argue passionately about
When you push people to explain how these things work
they usually can't
Just caring about something like parenting
or feeling confident about it
doesn't guarantee that we understand it
And everyone can't possibly be right about how parenting works
given how wildly beliefs have varied
Mothers in a huntergatherer society
regretted when their children cut themselves themselves
while playing with knives
but they thought the cuts were worth the freedom to explore
Even within one society like ours
parenting wasn't a common term until the s
Before then parents weren't viewed as active shapers of children's futures
Years from now
people may look back on today's views
and feel just as amazed as we feel
when hearing about other times and places
The science could help parents
and potential parents like my student
to understand how they actually shape who their children become
Millions of children have been studied to disentangle all those shaping forces
that are usually intertwined
These studies follow identical twins and fraternal twins
and plain old siblings
growing up together or adopted and raised apart
And it turns out that growing up in the same home
does not make children noticeably more alike in how successful they are
or how happy or selfreliant and so on
Imagine if you had been taken from birth
and raised next door by the family to the left
and your brother or sister had been raised next door
by the family to the right
by and large that would have made you no more similar or different
than growing up together under the same roof
On the one hand these findings seem unbelievable
Think about all the ways that parents differ from home to home
and how often they argue and whether they helicopter
and how much they shower their children with love
You would think that would matter enough
to make children growing up in the same home more alike
than if they had been raised apart
But it doesn't
In  a meta analysis
a study of studies
found this pattern across thousands of studies
following over  million twin pairs across  countries
They measured over  outcomes
And the researchers concluded
that every single one of those outcomes is heritable
So genes influence who children become
But genes didn't explain everything
The environment mattered too
just something in the environment
that didn't shape children growing up in the same home to be more alike
Some people have looked at these findings
and concluded that parenting doesn't matter
That you would have become the same person you are today
regardless of who raised you
On the other hand
and really I should say on the other hands
because there are many caveats to that story
but I'll focus on one
On the other hand
these findings are not all that shocking
If you think about how the same parent
could shape different children in different ways
One child might find it helpful when her mother provides structure
Her sister might find it's stifling
One child might think his parents are caring
when they ask questions about his friends
His brother might think they're being nosy
One child might view a divorce as a tragedy
while his sister sees it as a relief
Same event different experience
My husband and I experienced this concept  years ago
when we were  feet over the Atlantic
flying from Chicago to Stockholm to work on a research project
The flight attendants were clearing the dinner trays
people were getting ready to sleep
We hit a patch of bumpy air
and a bunch of teenagers whooped in excitement
Then all of a sudden the plane was plummeting
children and food carts hit the ceiling
The plane seemed to stabilize
but then plummeted again
The ceiling panels flew up into their compartments from the force
revealing wiring inside
Debris came crumbling down on us
People were screaming and sobbing
The plane plummeted again
After an eternity the pilot came on and announced
We don't know what that was
We don't know what's coming Stay in your seats
My husband came away from that experience feeling like planes are incredibly safe
Laughter
The airline sent a letter informing us that we hadn't simply been falling
across those thousands of feet of clear air turbulence
The plane had been subjected to forces greater than G
We learned that planes can withstand forces many times larger
So my husband feels safe flying
He seems genuinely baffled by how anyone could feel otherwise
I get that concept but only in the abstract
I've never been able to fly the same way since
Same event different experience
Just because an event doesn't shape people in the same way
that doesn't mean it had no effect
Your parenting could be shaping your children
just not in ways that lead them to become more alike
Your parenting could be leading your first child to become more serious
your second child to become more relaxed
Your first child to want to be like you
your second child to want to be nothing like you
You are flapping your butterfly wings to your hurricane children
This isn't how we typically think about parenting
It doesn't make for simple advice
How could parenting books tell people how to raise successful happy
selfreliant children
if the same parenting can lead to different outcomes
for children in the same home
At this point you might be thinking
like students in my class sometimes say
OK we get it
development is complicated
And maybe it's not worth studying because it's too complicated
But meaning can be made from chaos
Scientists now understand how babies go from these apparent lumps
to become walking talking thinking social independent beings
They understand this process well enough to intervene
to test newborns for example
and treat them for a genetic condition that used to lead to mental retardation
Scientists are developing ever more sophisticated understanding
of how parents could shape their children's futures
Science can tell us a lot
But it will never tell us everything
So what can we do with this
First know that parents matter
That might seem obvious
but smart people are arguing otherwise
and what seems obvious is not always true as we've seen
Second know that how parents matter is complex and difficult to predict
For anyone who has ever been a parent stop blaming yourself
as if you are in control of your child's path
You have influence
but you don't have control
For anyone who has ever been a child
stop blaming your parents
Laughter
At least for the idea that you are defined by them
Stop blaming other parents
A recent survey of thousands of parents revealed that  percent of mothers
and  percent of fathers feel judged
Close to half feel judged all the time or nearly all the time
by people they know and by complete strangers
These judgments probably don't reflect what's best for the kids
How could they given how profoundly parenting has varied around the world
and across time
And given how the same parents can shape children
under the same roof in such different ways
Even when parents try their best they can't satisfy everybody
There's only so much time
This is especially true for dragon parents
The author Emily Rapp came up with this term
after her baby was diagnosed with TaySachs disease
She knew then that Ronan would never walk or talk
He would likely die before turning four
I did not know
that this could also be the fate of my firstborn son
He was born with a condition
that prevents the intestine from absorbing nutrients
or water for the body
It affects one in five million babies
One in five million
It is so rare
that one doctor felt confident telling us that we would be screwed
if that's what our baby had
He was the one who had to break the news to us later
Dragon parents have a lot to say about parenting
even though they know their children will die young
or in my case
even if we have no idea whether our babies will live
Emily Rapp wrote
We will not launch our children into a bright and promising future
but see them into early graves
This requires a new ferocity
a new way of thinking a new animal
We are dragon parents
fierce and loyal and loving as hell
Our experiences have taught us how to parent for the here and now
for the sake of parenting
for the humanity implicit in the act itself
Parenting I've come to understand is about loving my child today
now
In fact for any parent anywhere that's all there is
I had thought that my expertise in child development
would help prepare me for becoming a parent
Instead becoming a parent helped me to see the science in a whole new light
So third appreciate how powerful the moments can be
because of what they mean for you and your child right now
not because of what they mean for your child long term
which you do not know
The activist Andrew Solomon noted
Though many of us take pride in how different we are from our parents
we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us
Maybe we could be less sad if we were more realistic
if we let go of the notion
that our children's futures are in our control
If we can embrace the complexity of our children's development
that can transform how we approach those parenting decisions we face each day
and empower us to realize how much more there is to having a child
than trying to shape a specific outcome
So much more
which I appreciate every day in moments with my firstborn son
who is thriving
and with his younger brother
and the unique paths they are taking
We are not screwed
Laughter
The science of parents and children
butterflies and their hurricanes
can free people to focus on what is most important
and meaningful in our lives
This can make the experience of being a parent
and the experience of having been a child
more realistic and satisfying for everyone involved
And that I think is very relevant to being a good parent

[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]
I grew up in Kuwait in the early s
where I was raised by screens
The main windows to reality for me were television and the internet
Not because of their accuracy
but because there were storytelling machines
These machines told stories that contradict one another
but all somehow seem true
The Arab region knew Kuwait to be one of the leading voices in media
specifically for comedy shows and theater
The rest of the world knew Kuwait to be a small country
that was located between Saudi Arabia Iraq and Iran during the Gulf War
Both stories are true
These screens that I drive my sense of reality from
told me different and sometimes contradicting stories
about who I am and where I come from
And that was the only way I understood anything around me
By placing it into different sets of stories
When social media came around
it changed the way screens worked for me
It wasn't only a window for observations anymore
but an interactive one
one I could use to identify everything around me
in even more varied in multiple ways
and to know myself better
and actually participate in the storytelling process
It started with these drawings
mostly crosshatched on photographs that I took with my iPhone
With time I started to animate them onto videos
that told stories from different perspectives
in a mocumentary series titled Bird Watch
It consists of scripted interviews by imagined minority voices
discussing a general issue or one of common interests
The title of the series is meant to ponder the idea
What if birds were watching back
What would they think of our obsession with speed and oil
Would they think we were dumb for standing under the rain
The second episode for example is an interview with a little girl
that tries to explain her definition of health
where she says she wants to be like her father
be strong smoke and tell children not to
And also like her grandmother
cook good food be loved by everyone
and have diabetes
She also introduces us to the stomach animal
It's the head of an animal that's connected to our stomachs
and its objective is to continue eating even after we're full
You see Kuwait has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity
Presenting it in an amusing story
while pointing out that children are themselves a minor voice
is a great way to really put the statistic into perspective
Another episode is an interview with a horse breeder
who talks about the rules of making sure your wellbred horse
is taken care of
She the horse must not be seen by others
must only mate with the same breed
must not be ridden by other men
and must be veiled
Making a story about a parameter of repression towards women funny
especially when it has animation or live action
is a great way to walk clear through walls
of censorship intolerance and political correctness
I tried to implement the ideas behind these two episodes
before or during my first art solo in 
but I still had to put it into a story to both be understood and accepted
By speaking in someone else's voice
I was experimenting with detachment from ideas
I grew up thinking where axioms
We're in a strange place
where our problem is the abundance of information
where the majority of people have a platform to be heard
but representation is still an issue
Representing a certain group giving them justice
All of these stories can naturally contradict
even if they differ slightly
We as humans are not merely the shape of body that we occupy
or the specific description of behavior
We're a multiplicity of stories
stories that often come in repetitive patterns
that can be rewritten and reread
Having been raised by screens
that told me different stories about who I am and where I come from
confused me in the best way possible
I saw that history is not as static as we thought
that stories can be told retold
read and reread
A change of context
change of perspective in hindsight
can assign different values to everything and everyone around us
The way I see it
that's where artists are most important
To present metadocumentations of our history
to give villains their origin story
Nothing and no one can be said to be good or bad
in isolation of the story around it
It's much like learning a new word
You have to use it in a sentence for it to make sense
And then to challenge its meaning
you begin to use it in an infinite amount of stories
Thank you
